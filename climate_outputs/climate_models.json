    "title": "Energy-balance climate models",
    "abstract": "An introductory survey of the global energy balance climate models is presented with an emphasis on analytical results. A sequence of increasingly complicated models involving ice cap and radiative feedback processes are solved and the solutions and parameter sensitivities are studied. The model parameterizations are examined critically in light of many current uncertainties. A simple seasonal model is used to study the effects of changes in orbital elements on the temperature field. A linear stability theorem and a complete nonlinear stability analysis for the models are developed. Analytical solutions are also obtained for the linearized models driven by stochastic forcing elements. In this context the relation between natural fluctuation statistics and climate sensitivity is stressed",

In order to compute T2, we must know D, which was\nleft as an adjustable parameter. By taking the obserced value for\n20\nT2 (-28.0\"C), we co_ure V = 0.649 N m'2(\u00b0C)\"I, or in dimensionless\nfo_ D/B = 0.310.

From observations (Ellis _t.tal._..,\n1978) we obtain II4 = 0.022, and using the prevlously comput.edvalue\nof D, _e compute T4 - 0.5\u00b0C. The observed value is T4 = -3.5\"C.\nThe model gives a value that is almost an order o_ magnitude too\ns_all and has the wrong sign. Ir fact, the higher mode a_,lltudes in\nthe model are so smnll that the two-mode solution is elose:._othe\nexact solutlon (North, 1975b). Perhaps the most prominent *_eatureof\nthe observations that is not reproduced by the model is the flattening\nof T(x) into a nearly isothermal band in the tropics. _nls flattening\nis probably due to mean motions in the tropical atmosphere CH_dley\ncell). The mean motions are more efficient than random motions at\nsuppressing temperature deviations. Lindzen and Farr_ll (_977) have\ndiscLussedmethods of allowing for the tropical mean motlon_). _neir\nmotivation was based upon results derived from a more comp=_ahensive\nmodel (Schneider and Lindzen, 1976) in which it was fom_d rihatnear\nthe equator T(o) - T(x) = x4.

Indeed,\nattempts by No_.thand Coakley to go beyond this mode fa_._d.\nAs in the mean annual _dels, we adopt _he Budyko form for the\nemitted fnfrared radiative flux,\nz(_,t) = _ + _'_(x,r) (52)\n32\n-2\nWith A - 203.3 and B u 2.09 Wm _C\"1 (North _nd Coakley, 1979), (52)\ngives the b_st _it to the mode amplitudes listed in Table 1 for the\nemitted fl_e_ and temperatures of the northern h_misphere. The fit\nto observationsis shown in Figure I0.\nWe constructthe seasonalmodel along the lines of previous\nsections. In the seasonal model, however, a storage term, C(_,_) _T/_t,\nmust be added;C(x,\u00a2) is a latitudeand longlrudedependen_heat\ncapacityper unit area. _e forcingis givenby the four ampllrudes\nin the mode expansion of S(x,t). The seasonal response is repre-\nsented by the four a_plitudesin the mode expansionof T(z,t). A\nlinearelimte model would connectthese two fieldswith a four-by-four\nresponsematrix. Linearityis suggestedby the absenceof higher\nharmonicsin both the forcingand responsefleld_ (Northand Coakley,\n1979). The most generallinearmodel with four componentsconsists\nof a responsematrix with 16 independentcomponents. We shall see\nthatmost of these elementsmay be taken to be zero.\nWith the storage term added the energybalance model becomes\n_T\nC(x,_) _- - 1)V2r + A + ST - QS(x,t) a(:<,t) . (S3)\nAs an idealizationof the northernhemisphere,we take a singlecon-\ntlvent with coastlines runnlng along mer\u00a3dlans and with an area\nspanning 40% of each latltude belt. We separate the continent from\nthe oceans becauseC(x,_) i_ only about (0.16B) years (CL) over land\nand about (4,7B) years (CW) over the ocean mixed layer (75 m).\nIf (53) is integratedarounda latltudebelt, we obtain for\ni the land r_ass(afterd_.'_Idi,_gthroughby f,, the fractionof !and area) i:\ni\ni\n\u2022 i:\n33\n; /\n/\nDo _T [leftCL _t \"\n154)\n+A*_L \" Q_l=,t) _(=,t) ,\nwhere TL is def_ed as the average _e_eratu_e over land in a latitude\nbelt.

Although difficult to vezlfT, this range probably\nbrackets the actual sensitivity o'f the climate.

For large t\nthis Integral approaches the stationary response function, G(x,y)\ndiscussed in Section 7, and illustrated for a particular model in\nFigure 20. According to (166), the stationary response of the true\ncllmare to a perrurbatlon could be estlmated from the Integral of\nrT(x,yzz)over a11 positive Z. As for the global _odel, low frequencies\ndc_d.vare,and in terms of the spatial cross spectrum we obtain\n/ dz[rT]-I (x,z;0)_ Re sT(z,y;0) + _ _I m sT(z,y;_)\n= C G(x,y) . (167)\nIn our terminology (167) is referred to as the \"weak\" form of the zonal\nfluctuation-dlsslpatlon relation. It generalizes the global version\n(147). The zonal version not only relates the time scales of natural\nfluctuations and responses to perturbations, but their spatial dlstri-\nbutloas as well. According to (167), the s?atlal response may be\nestlmated from the lo_ frequency cross-covar_an_e divided by the to_al\ncross-covarlance, i\n!In closing this section we shouid recal.i_sr orfglnal assumption\ntha_ the system can be d_vided Into slow and fast components, i.e._\n\u2022 : tha_ the autocorrel_tlon ti_aeof \"weather\" I.__ch shorter th_n cllr_tlc . : i i\n: re_J?_,,,_z_,..s.S_=_ Justlflcar_on for Mitchell's orig_,nalstochastic\n89\ntrea_nt of sea surface te_erature anom_lies is provided by the\nrel_tively lonz radiat_ve rela_etiou t_ of au ocean colt_t co_red\n\" to ths_ o_ the armo_pheric column that provides _he \u00a3orcingo In\nDudyko-Sellers models the ic_-albedo feedback results in long respouse ,i\ntlmes at least for the largest spatlal-scales, but one must _t18o\nIsolate the _ff_cts of the _an forcing in each mode.

The parametersTo, TI, _T and T2 thus\ngive a reasonablerepresentationof this hemisphericclimatevariable.\nAn obviousgoal in globalclimatetheory is to constructmodels that\ngeneratethese four parametersin agreementwith observationsand pre-\ndict how the parameterschangewhen externalconditionschange.\nSince (168)involvesonly the largestspace scales and the annual\ntime scaleand since the solar heating is also describableby these\nsame scales,we are encouragedto try simpleheat balancemodels that\nconnectthe two. 1_is reviewhas surveyedand appraisedrecentprogress\ntowardachievingthe connection.\nIn Section2 a sequenceof mean annual modelswas introduced.\nIt was sho%_nthat the mean annual global temperatureT can be estl-\no\nmated using the most elementaryradiationbalancecortslderations\nprovidedan empiricalformulafor the terrestrialoutgoingradiation\nis used.

Because dlffuslve terms lead naturally to the\nparabolic component P2(x) in the energy balance equation, it is natural\nto take the transport to be proportional to the gradient of temper-\nature. For simple diffusive models, the diffusion coefficient may\nbe adjusted so that the correct amplltude T2 is obtained. In order\nto estimate the sensitivity of the resulting two-mode model, more\nassumptions must be introduced. For example, if the earth is cooled,\nthe ice caps expand, the planet becomes more reflective to solar\nradiation. To allow for such changes, feedbacks such as cloudiness\nchanges, changes in the transport model and changes in the infrared\nformula due, for example, to lapse rate changes ought to be included.\nAs such feedbacks re'malnlargely unknown, they were not treated\nextensively In this paper. They, of course, merit further attention\nas more e_irical and theoretical information accrue.\nIn Section 2 it was shown _hat the simple Ice-cap models are non-\nlinear and have solutions that exhibit a rich structure. In particular\nthere are at leas_ three solutions for the present value of\" the solar\nconstant. If the sun's luminosity is lowered by about I0%, _he model /\nclimates experience a catastrophic translt_on to an Ice-corneredearth.\nThis feature appears to exlsteven in the resultsproduced_th\nnu_erlca! ge_eral circulation climate _dels. ., _\n/92\nBy introducing a heat storage term C_T/_t to the energy balance\nequation and allowing the _olar absorptloa to vary-wlth the seasonal _,_i_\ncycle, we showed in Section 3 that TI _nd _@Tcould be est!mated. It\nappears that reasonable values for these parameters can only be obtained r_._\"\nif the value of the thermal inertia C is taken to be much smaller over z:.'__\nland than over ocean. As a tevt of the simple seasonal model con- \"._ %,\n\" _, /p\nstruction, the four parameters To, TI, _T and T2 were computed for the :'7/_ _'_\nsouthern hemisphere by changing only the albedo and the land fraction.\nThe test proved satisfactory enough to suggest that the r_In feed- :i_,\nbacks which operate on a seasonal time scale had been incl_ed. \"_ _ :\nSection 4 concentrated upon the relatlonshlp between t_e quallty \"1_\nof the parame.terlzatlonf rmulae and their effect upon e_,'.i_tesof\nthe sensitivity to solar constant changes.

Clearly, m_re work \"\ncan be done on this problem and the simple models wi13 provi|z'e a useful\nframework for future discussions.\nSection _ covers the stability of the simple models. In parti-\ncular, it:was shown that the linear stab_llty of a _olu ion can be\ndeduced from the _Ign of the local slope of the ice line versus solar\nconstant curve. This slope-stabillty theorem appears to hold for a\nbroad class of models independent of numerical inputs. An analysis\nis also given for the finite amplitude time behavior of a class of\nmodels. A potential function can be constructed that yields quali-\ntative infor_mtlon about the behavior of the system far from steady\nstates. T1_e potential function can also be thought of as a vari-\national principle for the climate.\nSection 7 presents a simple analysis of sca\"ionary perturbations\nto the heat balance. The analysis shows that the sensitivity for any\nperturbation is related to the sensitivity for solar constant c_an_,es.\nThe relationship is shown to hold for a broad class of m,_dels.\nSection 8 concludes the review with an introduction to stochastic _.\nJclim_,.e models. The sim?le models of previous sections were linearized\nand all_ed to have a stochastic white noise forcing. Analytical\nsolutions are easily found for the various climate statistics. Example\nproofs of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem were given. _rough ._\nthis theorem, it was showr_ that info_.v_tlon about climate sensitivity :_'\n!can be derived from data on natural fluctuations.\n_ny of the results of this review arc expected to ho_d for more\n_o_rprehensive climate models.

We call for linking local ecosystem feedbacks with large-scale land-\natmosphere feedbacks in global and regional climate models in order to yield climate10\npredictions that we are more confident about.\n1 Introduction\nContinental- to regional-scale feedbacks at scales of 500\u201320 km between land and at-\nmosphere have been investigated with global and regional climate models during the\nlast two decades (Kabat et al., 2004). This research focused on regions where land-15\natmosphere feedbacks are strongly positive. This is because positive feedbacks could\nsupport alternative climate-vegetation regimes, for example wet and vegetated versus\ndry and bare (Claussen, 1997), leading to \u201ctipping elements\u201d (Lenton et al., 2008) in the\nEarth\u2019s climate system. At the same time, results from ecological models indicated that\nlocal vegetation-environment feedbacks at scales of 100\u201310m could also support al-20\nternative wet and vegetated versus dry and bare regimes at larger scales, even without\naccounting for large-scale land-atmosphere feedbacks (Rietkerk et al., 2004a). These\nlocal ecosystem feedbacks include important processes, such as the ability of vegeta-\ntion to retain soil, containing soil water and nutrients. However, these processes are\nomitted in global and regional climate models. Yet, clearly, the energy balance, and hy-25\ndrological and nutrient cycles connect local scales to large scales through atmospheric\nprocesses.\n10123\nBGD\n6, 10121\u201310136, 2009\nLocal ecosystem\nfeedbacks and\ncritical transitions in\nthe climate\nM. Rietkerk et al.\nTitle Page\nAbstract Introduction\nConclusions References\nTables Figures\nJ I\nJ I\nBack Close\nFull Screen / Esc\nPrinter-friendly Version\nInteractive Discussion\nIn this review we address feedbacks operating at disparate spatial scales in coupled\nclimate-ecosystem dynamics, and discuss cross-scale links between those feedbacks.\nWe argue that the coupling of feedbacks at multiple scales in climate models, and\nmost importantly including local ecosystem feedbacks, is an essential step to better\nunderstand and predict global climate change. We also provide a perspective on how5\nto establish this connection.\n2 Continental- to regional-scale feedbacks\nLand surface processes, in particular those associated with vegetation cover, impact\ncontinental- to regional-scale climate (Kabat et al., 2004; Koster et al., 2004; Fed-\ndema et al., 2005; Seneviratne et al., 2006; Bonan, 2008). The mechanisms are10\nbased on water exchange and latent heat flux through the vegetation, as well as on\nchanges in surface albedo and biogeochemical exchanges. These exchanges impact\nnear-surface climate, precipitation formation and atmospheric circulation patterns, with\npossible feedbacks to vegetation cover and land surface conditions.\nOne of the supposed \u201chot spots\u201d of land-atmosphere feedbacks is the North African15\ndesert. Surprisingly, proxy data reveal that the Sahara was covered with vegetation\nin the early- to mid-Holocene (10 to 6 kyr BP) (Jolly et al., 1998). This humid episode\nwas most likely caused by changes in the precession of the Earth orbit as the north-\nern subtropics at that time received more solar irradiation during summer than today.\nPresumably, stronger summer heating increased the land-ocean thermal gradient and20\namplified the African monsoon (Renssen et al., 2003). A strong positive feedback be-\ntween vegetation cover and this monsoon rainfall has been proposed, based on the\nmasking effect of vegetation on high surface albedo and better moisture recycling by\nplant transpiration (Claussen, 1997). About 6 to 4 kyr BP the climate of the Sahara\nshifted from a wet to a dry regime. A terrigenous dust record taken offshore West25\nSahara is interpreted in favour of a rapid shift from vegetated to desert conditions\nabout 5.5 kyr BP (deMenocal et al., 2000), while proxy records from Lake Yoa located\n10124\nBGD\n6, 10121\u201310136, 2009\nLocal ecosystem\nfeedbacks and\ncritical transitions in\nthe climate\nM. Rietkerk et al.\nTitle Page\nAbstract Introduction\nConclusions References\nTables Figures\nJ I\nJ I\nBack Close\nFull Screen / Esc\nPrinter-friendly Version\nInteractive Discussion\nin the eastern part of Sahara suggest a more gradual transition (Kropelin et al., 2008).\nThe mechanisms behind these differences are debated (Brovkin and Claussen, 2008).\nNonetheless, model results suggest that this shift, regardless of its abruptness, was\nassociated with the existence of nonlinear land-atmosphere coupling (Liu et al., 2007),\nand alternative dry desert and moist vegetated regimes may be permitted in the region,5\ndepending on initial vegetation cover (Claussen, 1997) (Fig. 1).\nPositive land-atmosphere feedbacks might also be at play in the Sahel. The Sahel\nclimate is characterized by variability in precipitation and periodic transitions between\ndry and wet regimes (Nicholson, 2000). Idealized models (Entekhabi et al., 1992) sug-\ngest a bimodal distribution of soil moisture in the Sahel. Such a bimodal distribution in10\nrainfall has also been observed in the region (Nicholson, 2009). In the 1970\u20131980s,\nthe region experienced intense and protracted drought. Recently, there is clear ev-\nidence of a greening trend in the Sahel (Seaquist et al., 2006), and this is directly\nlinked to increased rainfall (Nicholson, 2005). Earlier studies linked these fluctuations\nin rainfall to changes in albedo, triggered by desertification (Charney, 1975). Climate15\nmodels suggest that moisture recycling by vegetation transpiration is an important land\nfeedback to the atmosphere (Zeng et al., 1999). More recent analyses highlighted the\ndependence of rainfall on changes in sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic and on\nchanges in position and intensity of atmospheric circulation features over West Africa\n(Nicholson and Webster, 2007; Reason and Rouault, 2006).20\nExtratropical regions, such as the Great Plains of North America, continental Europe\nand the Mediterranean region, are also proposed to be sensitive to soil moisture- and\nvegetation-climate feedbacks (Koster et al., 2004; Seneviratne et al., 2006). These\nare of potential relevance for predictions of short-term precipitation and temperature\nvariability (Koster et al., 2004), the occurrence of extreme events such as the 200325\nheat wave (Fischer et al., 2007), and for large-scale circulation patterns (Fischer et al.,\n2007; Haarsma et al., 2009) and climate change (Seneviratne et al., 2006). A simple\nbox model predicts that there may be significant differences between the evapotranspi-\nration feedback of natural vegetation adjusting its cover to prevailing conditions, and\n10125\nBGD\n6, 10121\u201310136, 2009\nLocal ecosystem\nfeedbacks and\ncritical transitions in\nthe climate\nM.

Global warming could significantly\nimpact the reported feedbacks, because warming shifts the zones with transitional cli-\nmate between dry and wet conditions (e.g. the Great Plains, the Sahel region and\nMediterranean) (Seneviratne et al., 2006).5\nThe Amazon is another region where positive land-atmosphere feedbacks have been\nreported. Rainfall recycling is very pronounced here, because most of the rainfall is\ntranspired back to the atmosphere by the lush vegetation. Climate predictions suggest\nthat the East Amazon forest may therefore support different regimes and shift from for-\nest to savanna (Oyama and Nobre, 2003; Salazar et al., 2007). Other proposed posi-10\ntive land-atmosphere feedbacks in forests encompass nutrient cycling possibly leading\nto similar dynamics. Emissions of volatile organic compounds from the Amazon for-\nest into the atmosphere may prevent the loss of nutrients from the ecosystem through\nthe deposition of reaction products (Lelieveld et al., 2008). In phosphorus-limited dry\nforests, vegetation is sustained by atmospheric phosphorus input through rainfall, dust15\nand fog, and canopy density positively influences dust and fog deposition (DeLonge\net al., 2008). So, each of those positive land-atmosphere feedbacks might support\nalternating vegetation regimes between forest and savanna.\n3 Local ecosystem feedbacks\nSpatial self-organization of vegetation is an observed general phenomenon in ecosys-20\ntems around the globe (Rietkerk and Van de Koppel, 2008). Model studies conclude\nthat local positive ecosystem feedbacks between vegetation and environment could\nlead to such self-organization (Rietkerk et al., 2002; von Hardenberg et al., 2001).\nFor instance, a small-scale feedback between vegetation cover and rainwater infil-\ntration into the soil occurs in (semi-)arid ecosystems (Rietkerk and Van de Koppel,25\n1997). Model studies predict that this leads to spatial self-organization of vegetation,\nchanging the landscape, leading to optimization of water resources, and supporting\n10126\nBGD\n6, 10121\u201310136, 2009\nLocal ecosystem\nfeedbacks and\ncritical transitions in\nthe climate\nM.

Ex-\nternally induced climate change could then trigger critical transitions between those\nregimes. Other \u201chot spots\u201d of such vegetation, landscape and resource feedbacks\ninclude oligotrophic bogs (Rietkerk et al., 2004b; Eppinga et al., 2009) and savanna5\necosystems (Lejeune et al., 2002). Also, literature suggests that local positive feed-\nbacks exist between vegetation cover and nutrient retention because of the prevention\nof soil erosion (Rietkerk and Van de Koppel, 1997), between water and nutrient up-\ntake by vegetation and lateral root spread (von Hardenberg et al., 2001; Lejeune et\nal., 2002), and between vegetation cover and reduced evaporation through shading10\n(D\u2019Odorico et al., 2007). Results from idealized models predict that local feedbacks\ncould significantly affect large-scale climate and resilience of (semi-)arid ecosystems\nsuch as the Sahel (Dekker et al., 2007; Janssen et al., 2008). This is also likely to be\ntrue for other model and real coupled climate-ecosystems, because surface properties\nrelated to vegetation, landscapes and resources in ecosystems are well-known climate15\ndrivers through atmospheric processes (Nicholson, 2000).\nSo, vegetation has clear features of \u201cecosystem engineers\u201d (Jones et al., 1994): or-\nganisms that modify their abiotic environment, feeding back to the organisms (Gilad\net al., 2004; Hastings et al., 2007). Importantly, the effects of ecosystem engineers\non their environment typically outlive the engineer and go beyond the spatial scale of20\nthe local feedbacks (Hastings et al., 2007). In this way, vegetation can induce land-\nscape heterogeneity and spatial self-organization, leading to optimization of resource\ndistribution, feeding back to the vegetation.\n4 Missing cross-scale links\nThe exploration of positive feedbacks on continental-regional and local scales, sug-25\ngests that local feedbacks could lead to critical transitions between alternative regimes\nat larger scales. Interestingly, literature reveals that those feedbacks markedly\n10127\nBGD\n6, 10121\u201310136, 2009\nLocal ecosystem\nfeedbacks and\ncritical transitions in\nthe climate\nM.

For example, Dekker et al. (2007) show how local\nvegetation-hydrology feedback could impact regional-continental evapotranspiration-\nprecipitation feedbacks, increasing precipitation (Dekker et al., 2007). As a conse-\nquence, and strikingly, their model predicts the Sahel-Sahara boundary to be situated5\nhundreds of kilometres more northward as compared to models not accounting for this\nlink. The local vegetation-hydrology feedback may then affect the large-scale albedo-\nmoisture circulation feedback, boosting hysteresis in the climate system (Janssen et\nal., 2008). Thus, local positive feedback could propagate to regional-continental scale\nthrough cross-scale links (Fig. 1), possibly leading to critical transitions in the large-10\nscale climate. These are clear examples of missing cross-scale links in global and\nregional climate models.\nResearch so far leaves no doubt that the omission of cross-scale links between local\necosystem feedbacks and large-scale land-atmosphere feedbacks in global and re-\ngional climate models implies a major impediment for our ability to understand critical15\ntransitions between regimes in the large-scale climate. However, significant uncertain-\nties remain regarding the representation of relevant processes. Also, the feedbacks\nand related processes inferred from models are still insufficiently validated. Moreover,\npositive as well as negative feedbacks may occur (Taylor and Ellis, 2006).\nIf the cross-scale links and critical transitions between regimes are associated with20\na massive loss of ecological and economic resources, this can play large havoc on\nhuman societies. Indeed, ecosystems provide important services for human survival\nand well-being, such as food supply, grazing land and fresh water. Vice versa, human\ninduced cross-scale feedbacks might affect the large-scale climate. Increasing human\npopulation and land degradation have been suggested to have produced or enhanced25\ndrought conditions (\u201cdesertification\u201d), although that idea is still controversial (Reynolds\nand Stafford Smith, 2002). Human induced feedbacks might have to be implemented\nin climate models.\n10128\nBGD\n6, 10121\u201310136, 2009\nLocal ecosystem\nfeedbacks and\ncritical transitions in\nthe climate\nM. Rietkerk et al.\nTitle Page\nAbstract Introduction\nConclusions References\nTables Figures\nJ I\nJ I\nBack Close\nFull Screen / Esc\nPrinter-friendly Version\nInteractive Discussion\n5 Perspectives\nThe coupling of feedbacks at multiple scales is thus an essential and urgent issue\nto understand in order to predict ecosystem responses to climate changes and vice\nversa. Therefore, multi-scale models should be developed that adequately address\nfeedbacks at disparate scales. Such multi-scale approach could consist of a model hi-5\nerarchy, starting with current global and regional climate models with a grid resolution\nof 500\u201320 km, including nested higher-resolution simulations (e.g. 10\u20131 km). The need\nfor high-resolution global climate simulations has indeed been recognized (Heffernan,\n2008), and thus the direct coupling of these scales may be feasible soon, depend-\ning on computational resources. By downscaling, the employed climate models could10\nbe coupled with models representing local vegetation-environment feedbacks with a\ngrid resolution of 100\u201310m, and to represent the impact of local ecosystem feedbacks\non atmospheric processes at larger scales, corresponding parameterizations could be\nused in upscaling (Fig. 2). Such approach could circumvent the lack of computational\nresources, would allow taking into account the hierarchy of atmospheric processes,15\nand would provide a feasible parameterization of the effects of local ecosystem feed-\nbacks, and their links with large-scale land-atmosphere feedbacks. Also, it would al-\nlow determining the importance of different factors, such as vegetation and land use\ncharacteristics, for local vegetation-environment feedbacks, by studying the sensitiv-\nity of climate models to different parameterizations. To constrain parameterizations in20\nglobal and regional climate models, we need a better understanding of soil moisture-\nvegetation-climate relationships from local to large scale.\nThe relative importance of feedbacks and their cross-scale links should be explored\nin advance with idealized models that contain few state variables and parameters. This\nis because these models can reveal a significant range of complex behaviour observed25\nin real systems, despite their simplicity (Zeng et al., 2006; D\u2019Odorico et al., 2007).\nSuch simplified models are useful to explain phenomena observed both in nature and\nin complex global and regional climate models. Idealized models could be validated\n10129\nBGD\n6, 10121\u201310136, 2009\nLocal ecosystem\nfeedbacks and\ncritical transitions in\nthe climate\nM.

While simple models are needed for un-\nderstanding the relative importance of feedbacks and their cross-scale links, complex\nglobal and regional models are better suited for climate predictions, and to investigate\nthe involved feedbacks in their full complexity. We strongly advocate the integrated5\nuse of simplified, intermediate and full complexity models, ranging from local to large\nscales. By following this approach we will achieve further understanding and we envis-\nage climate predictions that we are more confident about.\nAcknowledgements.

The aim of the project was to develop functional\npiggery lay-outs for organic production especially designed for Finnish climate.\nThis means insulated buildings with heating for the wintertime period. The results\nconsist of both combination and fattening piggeries. The smallest model is for 40\nand the largest for 196 sows. The fattening units are mainly for 500 pigs. The\nbuilding layouts are designed to be flexible. Much attention has been paid to\nfarrowing pens and their animal friendly qualifications.\nT\nhe share of organic pork pro-\nduction is only 0,7 % of all pork\nproduction in Finland. The con-\nsumers\u2019 demand for organic pork has\nbeen slightly higher than production.\nStill the organic way of production has\nnot increased. This research and deve-\nlopment project was addressed to re-\nmove obvious obstacles in production.\nThe difficulties accumulate in the whole\nproduction chain from farmers to su-\npermarkets. The profitability of organic\nproduction is mainly dependent on the\nhigher market price compared to nor-\nmal pork production. This price diffe-\nrence has been slightly decreasing. The\nmarket signal is not strong enough to\nencourage farmers and they have been\npassive for new investments. The new\nmodels of this research are supposed to\npromote organic pork production into a\nnew phase. At least they assure a better\nanimal welfare compared to conven-\ntional production. Still today there are\nonly 23 farms in organic pork produc-\ntion. Only two new fattening units have\nbeen built since 1999 when the new EU\nand national rules for organic production\nwere introduced.\nFinnish climate and management\nThe Middle-European organic piggery\nmanagement models were not suited for\nFinnish climate demands. Buildings were\nmostly non-insulated and pasturing was\nusual. Due to harsh winter conditions\nFinnish piggeries must be insulated and\nheated, too. Outdoor exercise is compul-\nsory from June until the end of October.\nBoth manure and rain waters must be\ncollected from the exercise yards. This\nmeans yards with concrete or asphalt\ncovering with drainage systems.\nThe need for immediate outdoor access\nfrom each pen comprises with a layout\nFigure 2. A model for a large combination piggery for 190 sows and 1000 fattening pigs. The\nunit is a combination of three different phases which have been built as the production has\ngrown bigger. The manure storages are not shown in the figure.\nFigure 1. A model for a small combination piggery for 40 sows and 340 fattening pigs. The\nbuilding is one solid unit and it is expandable in the longitudinal direction.25\nFORSKNINGSNYTT \u2022 Nr 2 \u2022 2004\nwhere the building width is relatively\nsmall. When the unit size grows bigger\nthe building becomes either longer or\nthere are more individual buildings in-\nstead of one large wide span unit. This\nis welcome in old farmstead environ-\nments because small buildings fit better\ntogether with the old small scale farm\nbuildings.\nFunctional layout models\nThe layout designs promote good func-\ntionality with easy routes for animal\nmovements. Pen dimensioning tries to\nkeep social structure solid and thus avoid\nmisbehavior among pigs. The mainte-\nnance concepts concentrate mainly on\nmanure handling. Four models are based\non straw litter systems and one is purely\nfor slurry system. Straw is promoted\nbecause of its beneficial affects on ani-\nmal behavior and pen activity. The\nfinishing pens are dimensioned for 20\npigs. There is 1 tube feeder for each 10\npigs. This is a proper dimensioning from\nan animal behaviour\u2019s point of view. The\npens have a precision dimension so that\npigs between 30 and 85 kg have 1,1 m2\neach and have access to an exercise yard.\nThe fattening pigs between 85 and 110\nkg have 1,3 m2 each and no access outside\nbecause exercise is not compulsory for\nthem during the last 30 days of finishing.\nOrganic building, too\nThe buildings are designed to be organic\nas well. The building materials should\nbe natural, recyclable and can be safely\nterminated after use. The concrete is\nrecommended for floors and for lower\nparts of the walls. The rest of the buil-\nding frame, claddings and insulation can\nbe made of wood. The roof cover can be\nmetal sheet or bitumen felt. The heating\nsystem is based on heated water circu-\nlation and the energy source is local fire\nwood. The buildings are principally well\ninsulated and heated during the winter-\ntime. Natural ventilation is recommen-\nded as an energy saving concept for all\nbuildings. Still all models can be equipped\nwith electric fans.\nFind more information\nThe research report can be downloaded\nat the following website:\nhttp://www.mtt.fi/met/pdf/\nmet21.pdf (KIVINEN, T. 2003.\nLuomusikala Suomen olosuhteissa.

In a second step, the impact of future \nchanges in runoff on the management of dams, reservoirs and transfer systems is \nsimulated to advise provincial and local water authorities on potential future risks \nand opportunities. Yet, the actual impact of climate change on river runoff and \nwater management plans is highly uncertain due to a multitude of uncertainty \nsources, from greenhouse gas scenarios down to impact models used to project \nand adapt river management (Figure 1). The sources and reasons for these \nuncertainties cannot be discussed here, but the reader is referred to Foley [2010] \nfor an overview regarding regional climate simulations and to Refsgaard et al. \n[2007] regarding the environmental modelling process. \n \nM. Muerth et al. / Evaluation of different sources of uncertainty in Climate Change research ... \nThe aim of this paper is to present a method to compare the relative importance of \nthe uncertainties induced by different steps in the hydro-climatic model chain, from \nglobal climate models (GCMs) down to hydrological models (HyMs). This method is \napplied to results for two small natural flow tributaries (the Au Saumon and Loisach \nrivers) of two heavily managed river basins, namely the Haut-Saint-Francois (in \nQuebec) and Upper Isar (in Bavaria) catchments. Runoff in the Au Saumon is \ndominated by a distinct snow melt peak in spring followed by relative low flows in \nsummer. The Loisach has high flows in spring and summer due to snow melt and a \nprecipitation peak in summer, while low flows typically occur in late fall.  \n \nModel setups for hydrological research are usually \u201cvalidated\u201d against past runoff \ntime series, yet scenarios are often assessed based on the relative change \nbetween known past conditions and potential future conditions. Therefore, both the \nuncertainties in the hydro-climatic model chain regarding the reproduction of past \nrunoff (1971-2000) and regarding the potential future changes in runoff (for 2041-\n2070) are investigated. To characterize important runoff conditions for water \nmanagement, runoff is investigated using important mean, high and low flow \nindicators. \n \n \nFigure 1: Complex model chain and increasing uncertainty in hydrological climate \nchange research. Sources of uncertainty not considered in this paper are grey. \n \n \n2 METHODOLOGY \n \n \n2.1 The hydro-climatic ensemble \n \nThe quantification of the different sources of uncertainty regarding the reproduction \nof past flows and the projection of future changes in runoff is accomplished by \ncombining ensembles of regional climate model (RCM) simulations and \nhydrological models. In the context of QBic\n3\n, two different RCM ensembles for \nQuebec and Bavaria are available. Over Quebec, an ensemble of CRCM4 \nsimulations driven by five different members of CGCM3 represents the uncertainty \ncaused by the simulated natural variability of climate [de El\u00eda and C\u00f4t\u00e9 2010]. \nHowever, the five regional climate simulations that are used over Bavaria represent \nclimate model diversity. It includes one regional simulation of CRCM4 with CGCM3 \n(CRC-CGC), one RACMO2 simulation driven by ECHAM5 (RAC-ECM) and three \nRCA3 simulations driven by the global models BCM, ECHAM5 and HadCM3 \nM. Muerth et al. / Evaluation of different sources of uncertainty in Climate Change research ... \n(accordingly abbreviated RCA-BCM, RCA-EC2 and RCA-HCM) as produced for \nthe European ENSEMBLES project [Hewitt and Griggs 2004]. \n \nBias correction is applied to the RCM fields to improve the reproduction of past \nrunoff characteristics. Precipitation is corrected by the LOCI method of Schmidli et \nal. [2006] using monthly parameters, air temperature simply by monthly additive \nfactors, both resolved at the RCM\u2019s spatial scales. It has to be noted that the \nCGCM3-CRCM4 members are corrected with one set of parameters based on \nmember average precipitation and temperature to preserve the inter-member \nvariability. Bias corrected (BC1) as well as direct (BC0) RCM outputs are scaled to \nthe HyM resolution with the scaling tool SCALMET [Marke 2008], which preserves \nenergy and mass at the scale of the RCM grid, therefore preserving changes in \nclimate at the RCM scale as well. \n \nThe ensemble of HyMs used to simulate actual daily runoff for the investigated \ncatchments consists of four models with different structural complexity: The lumped \nmodel HSAMI (HSA) [Fortin 2000], the semi-distributed model Hydrotel (HYD) \n[Fortin et al. 2001] and the distributed models WaSim-ETH (WAS) [Jasper and \nSchulla 1999] and PROMET (PRO) [Mauser and Bach 2009]. The HyMs are \ncalibrated or optimized on observed daily runoff of a 10-year period which is \nincluded in the reference period.  \n \nIn the end, for both catchments 40 different runoff time series are produced by the \ncombination of these four HyMs with five climate simulations either bias corrected \nor not. The indicators presented are the overall mean flow during an investigated \nperiod, as well as the maximum high flow with a twenty years return period and the \nminimum 7-day low flow magnitude with a two years return period. More details on \nthe hydrological models ensemble and the chosen runoff indicators are given in \nVelasquez et al. [2012]. \n \n \n2.2 The quantification of uncertainties in complex model chains \n \nUsing the hydro-climatic ensembles, several estimations of a given indicator are \nsimulated for the reference (1971-2000) and the future period (2041-2070). \nDepending on the indicator, the disparity amongst the reference period simulations \nor the uncertainty associated with the potential future change of an indicator \nprincipally arise from a different component of the model chain. The distinction \nbetween disparity (in the reference period) and uncertainty (in the climate change \nsignal) is introduced to emphasize that in the context of the reference period, bias \ncorrection is not a source of uncertainty, but rather a method to bring results closer \nto observations. In the following, a graphical method that allows evaluating the \ncontribution of each model chain component to the overall disparity of reference \nflows or the overall uncertainty of change signals is proposed. (In the description \nbelow, 'uncertainty' is used, but the same applies for 'disparity'.)    \n \n1) One component of the total uncertainty (e.g. the choice of hydrological model) is \npicked and allowed to vary, while all other uncertainty components must remain \nfixed. For example, one member of the CGCM3-CRCM4 ensemble that has been \nbias corrected is picked, while hydrological models vary. That way, one case to \nquantify the impact of hydrological model choice on e.g. mean flow is constructed. \n \n2) By choosing all combinations of the other components, each possible way to \nisolate one uncertainty component is extracted from the data. This is repeated for \neach component and displayed as a series of boxes (colour coded for each \ncomponent) on a graph. The relative size of each collection of boxes then visually \nexposes the contribution of one component to the overall uncertainty. The example \non the left side of Figure 2 shows the components of the overall disparity of mean \nflow during the reference period at Au Saumon. \nM. Muerth et al. / Evaluation of different sources of uncertainty in Climate Change research ... \n \n3) By scaling the size of each box to the total uncertainty range, the relative range \nof each case compared to the total range of results is computed. \n \n4) Averaging all cases of one uncertainty component quantifies the relative \ncontribution of one component to the total uncertainty. Yet, as the contribution of \none source of uncertainty may be dependent on other components of the model \nchain, the sizes of the boxes belonging to one component may differ significantly. \nHence, to quantify this variability the standard deviation (StdDev) between all \ncases of one component is computed, disregarding the type of distribution of the \ndata as the available sample usually cannot be assumed representative for all \ncases that could be produced using all possible models.  \n \n5) By constructing radar charts, as for example at the right side in Figure 2, one \nmay visualize the average relative contributions to total uncertainty (or disparity) as \nwell as the agreement between cases based on the standard deviation. Yet, as the \ncases are intertwined, the relative contributions do not necessarily sum up to one. \n \n \nFigure 2: Disparity by model chain component (left) and relative contributions to \nthis disparity (right) of past mean flow for the Au Saumon river. \n \n \n3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \nIn the following, additional graphs as proposed in section 2.2 are presented and \nthe sources of uncertainty relevant to different hydrology indicators based on \ndifferent climate drivers for either past flows or future changes are discussed. It is \nnoted that a major aim is to discuss the ability of the method to summarize sources \nof uncertainty rather than to present a complete set of results for each catchment.  \n \n \n3.1 Discussion of reference period flow variability \n \nIn the case of Au Saumon, bias correction has the largest impact on simulated \nmean flows (see Figure 2). The spread of results (the size of the bars) are very \nsimilar within each of the three sources of uncertainty and mostly unaffected by \nbias correction. This is explained by the fact that the method used preserves the \nnatural variability of the CGCM3 members. Hence the StdDev of all three \ncomponents in the radar chart is very small. \n \nIn case of past mean flows for the Loisach (Figure 3), the spread of HyM results \nagain is quite small and largely unaffected by bias correction or choice of climate \nmodels (small StdDev). The impact of bias correction on the results is again larger, \nyet, as bias correction was applied on different RCMs separately, the spread of the \nM. Muerth et al. / Evaluation of different sources of uncertainty in Climate Change research ... \nbars now differs more strongly. Furthermore, the spread of the bars (the variability \nof results) due to climate model type now differs significantly between direct and \ncorrected RCMs. Hence, the climate model choice has the largest impact on the \ndisparity of simulated past mean flow, but mainly because of the large differences \nbetween the direct RCM drivers. \n \n \nFigure 3: Disparity by model chain component (left) and relative contributions to \nthis disparity (right) of past mean flow for the Loisach river. \n \nAlthough the LOCI method applied to correct precipitation biases does correct the \nfrequency and the intensity of events, the high and especially the low flow \nmagnitudes (see Figure 4) are only partly affected. The differences between \nclimate model members are again comparatively small, too. Actually, the \nreproduction of past low flow magnitudes is largely determined by the choice of \nhydrological model structure. This is obvious from both the bar graph and the radar \nchart. Yet, the main issue is that some HyMs are strongly affected by bias \ncorrection, while others are not. This is obvious especially for WaSim-ETH (WAS) \nand HSAMI (HSA) in the case of low flows. The question if these sensitivities are \nplausible or not cannot be answered within this manuscript, yet the importance of \nHyM structure is obvious in the proposed graphs.  \n \n \nFigure 4: Disparity by model chain component (left) and relative contributions to \nthis disparity (right) of 7-day low flow magnitudes for the Au Saumon river. \n \n \n3.2 Analysis of climate change signal uncertainties \n \nIn the previous section, the disparities in our model ensembles regarding the \nreproduction of past runoff characteristics have been analysed. Yet, in most climate \nchange impact studies conclusions regarding the relative change of certain \nindicators between a reference (here: 1971-2000) and a future time period (here: \nM. Muerth et al. / Evaluation of different sources of uncertainty in Climate Change research ... \n2041-2070) are provided. Hence, the uncertainties regarding this relative change \nare now analyzed and discussed.  \n \nFor overall mean flow, Figures 5 clearly demonstrates for both catchments that the \nbias correction methods chosen for this investigation induce the least uncertainty in \nthe change signal. Yet, they had been most or second most important in the \nreference period analysis. Then again, compared to the total range of results (-10 \n% to +25 % for Au Saumon and -20 % to +10 % for Loisach) the uncertainty in the \nprojected future change of mean flow is most importantly affected by the choice of \nGCM members at Au Saumon and the GCM-RCM setup at Loisach. For Au \nSaumon, where only natural variability is investigated, this is again a stark contrast \nto the results for the reference period (Figure 2). \n \nFurthermore, the choice of HyM had been of little importance in the reproduction of \npast mean flows, just because HyMs are optimized to reproduce past runoff. Yet, \nthe projected future change of mean flow is significantly affected by the choice of \nHyM (e.g. the evapotranspiration formulation), although the high StdDev in the \ncase of Loisach shows that the spread of the HyM uncertainty is affected by certain \nclimate model and bias correction cases. \n \n  \nFigure 5 Relative contributions to the uncertainty for the projected change of \noverall mean flow in the Au Saumon (left) and Loisach (right) rivers.  \n \nAs for the reproduction of the past magnitude of 7-day low flows, the main reason \nfor the uncertainty about the future change of low flow magnitude (about +5 % to -\n50 %) is the choice of HyMs (Figure 6). Similar to the projected change of OMF, \nbias correction has the least importance regarding projection uncertainty. Although \nGCM members affect the projected change in low flow magnitude for Au Saumon \nmore than bias correction, the StdDev of the GCM member bars is large. \nEspecially WaSim-ETH reacts strongly to different GCM members, while other \nHyMs result in slight differences in low flow magnitude change only, when forced \nby different GCM members (not shown). In summary, the described contributions \nto overall uncertainty are again obvious in the radar chart. \n \n \nFigure 6: Relative contributions to the uncertainty of 7-day low flow (left) and high \nflow (right) change in magnitude for the Au Saumon river. \n \nM. Muerth et al. / Evaluation of different sources of uncertainty in Climate Change research ... \nFinally, the projected change in high flow magnitude has a very large total \nuncertainty, ranging from -30 % to +50 %. Furthermore, the contributions from all \nthree sources of uncertainty, presented for Au Saumon, are of similar importance. \nThis suggests that the reproduction of the complex processes leading to peak flows \nin rivers is very sensitive to both, HyM structure and calibration as well as \nsimulated temporal sequence of weather conditions. A detailed analysis of \nhydrological indicator sensitivity to the choice of hydrological model structure is \ngiven in Velazquez et al. [2012].   \n \n  \n4 CONCLUSION \n \nTo this day, the assessment of current and future hydrological conditions on the \nclimatological timescale requires the use of a complex modelling chain, which \nintroduces several sources of uncertainty that simply cannot be ignored without \ncareful justification. The quantification of these sources of uncertainty and the \nbehaviour of specific components of the modelling chain with respect to various \nuncertainty components is nontrivial. Here, compact graphical tools for such an \nanalysis are presented. Using such tools, it is clearly and succinctly shown that \ndifferent hydrological indicators have drastically different relationship to each of the \nuncertainty components. To name a few, while all hydrological models were in \nfairly good agreement when it came to reproducing current overall mean flow, they \nrepresented the largest source of uncertainty when looking at high and low flow \nindicators. Also, the simulation of current flows can be strongly influenced by the \nuse of bias correction, but when looking at climate change signals, this component \nof uncertainty often became the least important. A natural extension of this analysis \nwould seek to add different emission scenarios and complete the ensemble such \nthat natural variability over Bavaria and the choice of climate model over Quebec \nare assessed, yielding five uncertainty dimensions in the full analysis.  \n \n \nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n \nThe CRCM data has been generated and supplied by Ouranos.

Introduction\n[2] The Southern Ocean plays a key role in regulating\nthe Earth\u2019s climate: it connects the three main ocean basins,\ntransporting heat and carbon [S\u00e9f\u00e9rian et al., 2012], and its\nsea ice greatly affects the planetary albedo. Bottom water\nformed in the Southern Ocean circulates worldwide [Orsi\net al., 1999].\n[3] Numerous global climate models (GCMs), with dif-\nferent parameterizations, resolutions and structure, are being\nused by scientists worldwide to estimate the likely climate\nin 50\u2013100 years (e.g., global temperature increase or sea\nlevel rise). The ability of a model to adequately depict bot-\ntom water formation is crucial for accurate prediction of\nchanges in the thermohaline circulation [Hay, 1993]. In the\nreal ocean, Antarctic Bottom Water usually forms when\ncold dense water spills off the shelf [Orsi et al., 1999]\nand then spreads northwards. This process is particularly\nchallenging to represent in the current generation of cli-\nmate models. There have also been episodes of open ocean\ndeep convection, mostly observed in the Weddell Sea in\nAdditional supporting information may be found in the online version\nof this article.\n1School of Environmental Sciences, University of East Anglia,\nNorwich, UK.\n2School of Mathematics, University of East Anglia, Norwich, UK.\n3Met Of\ufb01ce Hadley Centre, Exeter, UK.\nCorresponding author: C.

Here, we assess how dense\nwater is formed in climate models, and how this impacts the\nrepresentation of ocean properties at the sea bed.\n[4] The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase\n5 (CMIP5) project [Taylor et al., 2012] facilitates assess-\nment of the models\u2019 ability to depict the present observed\nstate of the climate system, a prerequisite for reliable future\nprediction. Southern Ocean observational data coverage has\ndramatically increased over recent decades, particularly in\nthe ice-free regions, enabling a detailed analysis of climate\nmodel simulations of this key region. The last generation of\nmodels in CMIP3 poorly represented Southern Ocean trans-\nport and heat \ufb02uxes [Russell et al., 2006]. Subantarctic Mode\nWater and Antarctic Intermediate Water layer thicknesses\nand northward extensions were too small, despite a reason-\nably accurate depiction of temperature and salinity [Sloyan\nand Kamenkovich, 2007]. To our knowledge, there has been\nno assessment of Antarctic Bottom Water in CMIP3 models.\nHere, we evaluate bottom water properties in the Southern\nOcean in CMIP5 models.\n2. Methodology\n[5] We assess Southern Ocean potential temperature,\nsalinity, density and sea ice concentration in 15 CMIP5\nhistorical simulations (means of the 20 August monthly\nmean \ufb01elds from 1986 to 2005, of the \ufb01rst ensemble\nmember, designated r1i1p1 in PCMDI terminology).\nThe models include a hybrid/isopycnal model: GFDL-\nESM2G [Dunne et al., 2012], available through CMIP5 on\nz-level coordinates, and three \u0002-coordinate models:\nINMCM4 [Volodin et al., 2010] requiring conversion to\nz-coordinates, MIROC4h [Sakamoto et al., 2012] and\nMIROC-ESM-CHEM [Watanabe et al., 2011], both avail-\nable converted to z-level coordinates. The remaining 11 are\ntraditional z-level models: CanESM2 [Chylek et al., 2011],\nCNRM-CM5 [Voldoire et al., 2011], CSIRO-Mk3-6-0\n[Gordon et al., 2010], GFDL-ESM2M [Dunne et al., 2012],\nGISS-E2-R [Schmidt et al., 2006], HadGEM2-ES [Jones\net al., 2011], HiGEM [Shaffrey et al., 2009], IPSL-CM5A-\nLR [Dufresne et al., in revision], MPI-ESM-LR [Jungclaus\net al., 2010], MRI-CGCM3 [Yukimoto et al., 2011] and\nNorESM1-M [Tjiputra et al., 2012].\n[6] The 20 year mean model \ufb01elds are compared with his-\ntorical hydrographic data on a grid spacing of 0.5\u0131 \u0002 0.5\u0131\n[Gouretski and Koltermann, 2004], and with the Hadley\nCentre sea ice climatologies [Rayner et al., 2003]. The\nmodel \ufb01elds have all been interpolated to the same grid as\nthe hydrographic climatology, and the climatological values\nsubtracted from the model \ufb01elds to provide difference maps.\nFor each model, we calculate the area-weighted root mean\nsquare (RMS) difference from the climatology of the diag-\nnostic \ufb01elds at all depths (similar results were obtained for\ndifferent depth ranges); in the absence of relevant uncer-\n1409\nHEUZE ET AL.: AABW IN CMIP5\ntainty measurements for the climatological \ufb01elds, the model\nwill be considered as accurate if for each parameter, its RMS\ndifference is smaller than the mean RMS difference of the\n15 models.\n[7] The hydrographic climatology is biased towards sum-\nmer observations, but this does not affect our results since\nbottom properties are seasonally decoupled from the sur-\nface. To estimate the climatological mixed-layer values in\nwinter, we assume that the properties of the subsurface\ntemperature minimum (Winter Water) represent the temper-\nature and salinity that the mixed-layer would have had the\nprevious winter.\n[8] For all models, we calculate potential density rela-\ntive to 2000 m (\u00022) and relative to the surface (\u0002\u0002 ) using\nthe equation of state EOS80 [Fofonoff and Millard, 1983].\nSalinities are quoted on the practical salinity scale and so\nhave no units. We analyze the properties at the deepest grid\ncell during the August mean, when sea ice extent is great-\nest and deep water forms. In considering the replenishment\nof deep water, we determine for each grid point for each\nAugust throughout the 20 years of the study, the maximum\nof the mixed-layer depth (MLD) using a density \u0002\u0002 thresh-\nold of 0.03 kg m\u20133 from the 10 m depth value (as de\ufb01ned\nby de Boyer Mont\u00e9gut et al. [2004]). The same technique is\nused for the climatology, using the Winter Water density as\nthe 10 m value. To show the percentage of the water col-\numn that is well-mixed, we present the MLD divided by\nthe water depth at each point. A value close to 100% indi-\ncates areas where deep convection occurs. We do not use\nthe mixing parameters mlotst and omlmax, which are some\nof the recommended CMIP5 outputs, because they are not\navailable for all the models. We prefer using a consistent\nde\ufb01nition for all models and the climatology. We also found\nthat the CMIP5-recommended globally applied threshold of\n0.125 kg m\u20133 was too high to correctly determine MLD in\nthe relatively unstrati\ufb01ed Southern Ocean. Salinity is not\nshown, but whether each model is too salty or too fresh can\nbe deduced from considering the temperature and density\nmaps together, since density depends on both temperature\nand salinity.\n3. Results\n[9] The RMS differences from the climatology for bot-\ntom temperature and density for each model are indicated\non Figures 1 and 2, respectively. They can also be found in\nTable S1 (in the Auxiliary Material) along with the RMS dif-\nferences for salinity, the area-weighted mean differences for\neach parameter, and the 20 year trends that we discuss at the\nend of this section.\n[10] Bottom temperature in the whole deep Southern\nOcean in locations deeper than 1000 m for CNRM-CM5\n(Figure 1c), GFDL-ESM2M (Figure 1e), MPI-ESM-LR\n(Figure 1j), MRI-CGCM3 (Figure 1k) and MIROC4h\n(Figure 1o) is on average about 1\u0131C warmer than the clima-\ntology. As their salinity \ufb01elds (not shown) are within 0.05\nof the climatological value in the same area and therefore do\nnot dominate the density difference, they are less dense than\nthe climatology by on average 0.15 kg m\u20133 (Figures 2c, 2e,\n2j, 2k and 2o). In contrast, GFDL-ESM2G (Figure 1m) and\nINMCM4 (Figure 1n) are more than 0.5\u0131C colder than the\nclimatology on average for locations deeper than 1000 m in\nthe Southern Ocean. The largest difference is encountered\nin the Paci\ufb01c sector for INMCM4 (1.4\u0131C colder) and in the\nAtlantic for GFDL-ESM2G (0.8\u0131C colder). GFDL-ESM2G\nis also fresher than the climatology in the whole area\n(by 0.1), hence, its density is within 0.05 kg m\u20133 of the cli-\nmatology on average in the Southern Ocean (Figure 2m).\nHowever, the deep waters of INMCM4 are 0.7 saltier across\nthe entire deep Southern Ocean, and so 0.7 kg m\u20133 denser in\nthis area (Figure 2m). CanESM2 (Figure 1b) and MIROC-\nESM-CHEM (Figure 1p) temperatures lie within 0.2\u0131C of\nthe climatology, but are on average 0.2 saltier, so they\nare 0.15 kg m\u20133 denser than the climatology (Figures 2b\nand 2p), consistent with the dominant effect of the salin-\nity. GISS-E2-R (Figure 1f) is on average within 0.5\u0131C of\nthe climatological values, but its temperature RMS differ-\nence is greater (1.24\u0131C) because of the meridional gradi-\nent in temperature: the model displays a 6\u0131C difference\nbetween the subtropics (50\u0131S) and the Antarctic waters\n(80\u0131S), whereas the climatology displays a maximum of\n3.5\u0131C difference over the same latitude range. The same\nphenomenon is observed for GISS-E2-R\u2019s salinity and den-\nsity (Figure 2f). For locations deeper than 1000 m in the\nSouthern Ocean, CSIRO-Mk3-6-0 (Figure 1d), HadGEM2-\nES (Figure 1g), HiGEM (Figure 1h), IPSL-CM5A-LR\n(Figure 1i) and NorESM1-M (Figure 1l) are within 0.5\u0131C\nand 0.1 in salinity, and is within 0.05 kg m\u20133 of the observed\nclimatology (Figures 2d, 2g, 2h, 2i and 2l).\n[11] We now consider if the source of the dense bottom\nwater could originate from dense shelf water (Figure 2). Bot-\ntom density maps are not shown, but shelf production can\nbe seen where areas of deep convection (inside the black\ncontour) intersect regions shallower than 3000 m (inside\nthe gray contours). Five models produce very little or no\ndense water on the shelf: CNRM-CM5 (Figure 2c), MRI-\nCGCM3 (Figure 2k), NorESM1-M (Figure 2l), MIROC4h\n(Figure 2o) and MIROC-ESM-CHEM (Figure 2p). Mod-\nels have a \ufb01xed freezing point, set to values ranging from\n\u20132.5\u0131C to \u20131.8\u0131C, so the difference between the shelf tem-\nperature and the climatology has an upper limit. The water\nproduced on the shelf is not dense enough in these models,\nbecause it is far too fresh: more than 0.25 fresher than in\nthe deep ocean. No consistent link has been found between\nshelf water density and sea ice extent.\n[12] The other models produce dense water on the\nRoss and Weddell Sea shelves, with enhanced local\ndensities of more than 0.2 kg m\u20133, in agreement with the\nclimatology. However, because of the horizontal/isopycnal\ndiffusion schemes in z-level GCMs, this dense water formed\non the Antarctic shelf mixes horizontally as well as vertically\nat each grid point as it travels down the shelf slope. Longi-\ntudinal sections (not shown) suggest that through enhanced\nmixing, the dense shelf water is unable to maintain its prop-\nerties while sinking and propagating northwards, becoming\nmixed with intermediate waters. None of the models are\nable to form dense bottom water through export from the\ncontinental shelf. Even though one might expect that the\nisopycnal (Figure 2m) or \u0002-coordinate (Figures 2n, 2o and\n2p) models should simulate this process better, we \ufb01nd no\nevidence that these four models are any better at exporting\ndense water from the shelf.\n[13] The climate models in this study generate dense\nbottom water through open ocean deep convection. In\nobservations, this process occurs rarely [Marshall and\nSchott, 1999] and does not penetrate to the sea bed.\n1410\nHEUZE ET AL.: AABW IN CMIP5\nFigure 1. (a) Mean bottom potential temperature of the climatology and (b\u2013p) mean bottom temperature difference\n(model - climatology); left colorbar corresponds to the climatology, right colorbar to the differences model-climatology\n(same unit). Thick dashed black line is the mean August sea ice extent (concentration > 15%); thick continuous black line\nis the mean February sea ice extent (concentration > 15%). Numbers indicate the area-weighted root mean square error for\nall depths between the model and the climatology (unit \u0131C); mean RMS = 0.97\u0131C.\nDeep convection is likely to occur in regions where the\nmixed-layer extends deeper than half of the whole water\ncolumn (regions enclosed by the black line on Figure 2).\nThe results are insensitive to the choice of indicator\nfor deep convection. Some models produce dense water\nby strong deep convection over a large area: GFDL-\nESM2M (Figure 2e), GISS-E2-R (Figure 2f) and GFDL-\nESM2G (Figure 2m). HadGEM2-ES (Figure 2g), HiGEM\n(Figure 2h), IPSL-CM5A-LR (Figure 2i) and MPI-ESM-\nLR (Figure 2j) host deep convection in smaller areas\nwithin the Weddell and Ross Gyres, and it is these models,\nwhich compare well against the bottom water properties of\nthe climatology.\n[14] In contrast, CNRM-CM5 (Figure 2c) and MIROC4h\n(Figure 2o) have almost no deep convection, and MRI-\nCGCM3 (Figure 2k) only in the Indian sector but not in\nthe subpolar gyres. These three models develop low-density\nbottom water (and even lower density surface water) which\nis too warm, not even producing dense water on the shelf.\nIt might appear that GFDL-ESM2M (Figure 2e) performs\nsimilarly, with warm low-density bottom water, but unlike\nthe three other models, it hosts deep convection in the\nWeddell Gyre. GFDL-ESM2M also has much less winter\nsea ice than CNRCM-CM5, MRI-CGCM3 and MIROC4h,\nwhich may explain the different convective behavior (as we\nexplain below).\n[15] CanESM2 (Figure 2b), CSIRO-Mk3-6-0 (Figure\n2d), NorESM1-M (Figure 2l), INMCM4 (Figure 2n) and\nMIROC-ESM-CHEM (Figure 2p) do not host deep con-\nvection. They are more saline and/or colder than the\nother models, and therefore denser at the sea bed, so\nthe ocean is too strati\ufb01ed to convect.

In contrast, CSIRO-Mk3-6-0, NorESM1-\nM and MIROC-ESM-CHEM global bottom properties\n(not shown) indicate that brief open ocean deep convec-\ntion episodes occur in the Weddell Sea for these mod-\nels, but a higher temporal resolution than the monthly\nmean output available would be necessary to observe this\nprocess happening.\n[16] Some of the different behaviors in the models\u2019 bot-\ntom water densities can be explained by the models\u2019 repre-\nsentation of the seasonal cycle in sea ice extent (black lines\non Figure 1). GISS-E2-R (Figure 1f) and GFDL-ESM2G\n(Figure 1m) have no sea ice left in February and extensive\ndeep convection areas. These models\u2019 sea ice needs to be\nreplaced entirely each year, leading to large amounts of brine\nrejection as the new ice forms, which may cause the vigor-\nous deep convection. Likewise, HadGEM2-ES (Figure 1g),\nHiGEM (Figure 1h), IPSL-CM5A-LR (Figure 1i) and MPI-\nESM-LR (Figure 1j) have less sea ice in February than is\nobserved and host deep convection in the Weddell and Ross\nGyres, but as some sea ice remains in February, their deep\nconvection is less intense than for GISS-E2-R and GFDL-\nESM2G. In contrast, CanESM2 (Figure 1b), CSIRO-Mk3-\n6-0 (Figure 1d), MRI-CGCM3 (Figure 1k), NorESM1-M\n(Figure 1l) and MIROC-ESM-CHEM (Figure 1p) maintain\nextensive sea ice during summer, and have no deep convec-\ntion in the subpolar gyres. As the ocean remains covered by\nsea ice all year long in these models, the mixed-layer is insu-\nlated from the cold atmosphere, the brine rejection process is\nsigni\ufb01cantly reduced, and no dense water is created by deep\nconvection in the subpolar gyres.\n1412\nHEUZE ET AL.: AABW IN CMIP5\n[17] Finally, INMCM4 (Figure 1n) and GFDL-ESM2M\n(Figure 1e) August sea ice extents exhibit unusual patterns,\nwith very little sea ice respectively in the Ross and Wed-\ndell Seas. This could explain why INMCM4 (Figure 2n) is\ndenser than the climatology but does not host deep convec-\ntion, while GFDL-ESM2M (Figure 2e) is less dense than\nthe climatology but has an extensive area of deep con-\nvection. However, it is also possible that these models are\nexhibiting low frequency variability or are not yet at equi-\nlibrium. Trends during the two decades of the study of the\narea-weighted mean bottom properties (see Table S1) give a\ndecrease of INMCM4\u2019s salinity of 0.008 per decade, while\nGFDL-ESM2M is cooling by 0.013\u0131C per decade. Like-\nwise, CNRM-CM5A (Figure 2c) and MIROC4h (Figure 2o),\nwhich both have low-density, warm bottom waters, also have\nsigni\ufb01cant cooling trends of 0.02\u0131C per decade.\n[18] Of the 15 models in this study, four others have\na decreasing bottom temperature trend and their bottom\ntemperature is warmer than the climatology: CSIRO-Mk3-\n6-0 (-0.011\u0131C/decade), MRI-CGCM3 (-0.010\u0131C/decade),\nNorESM1-M (\u20130.022\u0131C/decade) and MIROC-ESM-CHEM\n(\u20130.020\u0131C/decade). This suggests that these models exhibit\nlow frequency variability in bottom water properties. In\ncontrast, GISS-E2-R seems to be adjusting to a new cli-\nmate state: while it is already colder than the climatology\nin the Weddell and Ross basins, it continues cooling by\n0.023\u0131C/decade over the whole Southern Ocean. We note\nthat any model drift (as determined from control runs) has\nnot been removed from the model trends quoted here.\n4. Conclusions\n[19] Half of the 15 climate models studied here demon-\nstrate an acceptable representation of the water mass\nproperties at the sea bed around Antarctica, with their area-\nweighted RMS difference from the climatology being lower\nthan the mean of the group of models studied here for bottom\ntemperature, bottom salinity and bottom density. The other\nhalf are either too warm or too cold, too salty or too fresh.\nHowever, a difference between the modeled bottom waters\nand the observations can arise because the climate model\u2019s\nocean state has not fully adjusted from the initial conditions\nand may never approach an equilibrium state due to some\ninternal long-term trends [Sen Gupta et al., 2012].\n[20] Ten of the 15 GCMs produce dense water on the\ncontinental shelf, but in none of them can this water spill\noff the shelf, sink and spread northwards as dense bottom\nwater. For half of the models, deep water is created by\ndeep convection in the open ocean, a mechanism that rarely\noccurs in the real ocean. However, this mechanism can result\nin relatively realistic deep water properties. Such convec-\ntion would have implications for the model carbon and heat\nuptake by inducing too strong mixing and ventilation, and\nhence climate sensitivity. Models with extensive deep con-\nvection areas (GFDL-ESM2M, GISS-E2-R, MRI-CGCM3\nand GFDL-ESM2G) are the ones with a strong seasonal\ncycle in sea ice: their ocean undergoes a larger heat trans-\nfer to the atmosphere, hence cools more, becomes saltier\nthrough brine rejection and thus denser.\n[21] The three models with the best representations of\nthe sea bed properties (HadGEM2-ES, HiGEM and IPSL-\nCM5A-LR) are the ones hosting deep convection in the\nsubpolar gyres only. In contrast, models which do not\ngenerate deep convection depict poor bottom water proper-\nties and are unlikely to lead to accurate predictions of the\nfuture state of the deep ocean. Global analyses (not shown)\nsuggest that these models form their deep water either out-\nside of our area of study or through brief deep convection\nevents that we cannot detect with our temporal resolution of\nmonthly average model output.\n[22] In this study, no correlation has been found between\nthe models\u2019 performances and either their resolution\n(horizontal or vertical) or the vertical coordinate system\n(isopycnal, z-level or sigma) used.\n[23] No model reproduces the process of Antarctic bottom\nwater formation accurately. Instead of forming dense water\non the continental shelf and allowing it to spill off, mod-\nels present extensive areas of deep convection, thus leading\nto an unrealistic, unstrati\ufb01ed open ocean. Further efforts\nshould be put into a better representation of Antarctic water\nmasses and shelf processes, a key challenge to improve the\nreliability of climate projections. A grid box model can-\nnot adequately represent the down-slope \ufb02ow, and it is not\nclear that higher resolution provides improvements. It is con-\nceivable that a super-parameterization scheme [Stan et al.,\n2010] might be devised, perhaps based on a high resolution\nisopycnal model, which would improve the down-slope \ufb02ow\nrepresentation. Adaptive meshes and \ufb01nite element meshes\n[Ford et al., 2004] could be a solution to model shelf pro-\ncesses at a higher resolution than the open ocean, although\nthey are computationally costly. A simpler solution may be\nto use tunnels to instantly transport water from the shelf seas\nto the deep ocean [Briegleb et al., 2010].\n[24] Acknowledgments.

The most important component of this\ngreenhouse effect studied in the past decades has been car-\nbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere. Its storage in forests and\noceans, and its production by industry, are subjects of major\ninterest. More recently dimethylsulphide (DMS) molecules in\nthe atmosphere have been identi\ufb01ed as a potentially signif-\nicant modi\ufb01er of solar radiation re\ufb02ectance (Charlson et al.,UN\nPlease cite this article in press as: Cropp, R., Norbury, J., Investigations into a\nchange scenarios, Ecol.

(2004) also demonstrates that this\necosystem model can be further decomposed into two sub-\nmodels: a nutrient\u2013phytoplankton\u2013zooplankton (NPZ) model\nand a bacteria\u2013zoo\ufb02agellate\u2013nutrient (BFN) sub-model.\nThis GMSK non-linear ODE ecosystem model (which has\nfour degrees of freedom) possesses a very stable and some-\nwhat complicatedand interesting limit cycle; that is, a periodic\nset of solutions that correspond to regular plankton blooms\n(Cropp et al., 2004). It is often thought that systems with three\normore degrees of freedom should have chaotic solutions.We\n\ufb01nd that the biological parameters have to be changed signif-\nicantly in order to \ufb01nd pseudo-chaotic behaviour, and that for\nthemost part themodel is robust in its behaviour. Akey advan-\ntage of understanding our stable limit cycle is that it allows for\nthe identi\ufb01cation of the various complicated interactions and\nprocesses in the time-dependent non-linear dynamics. In par-\nticular, we explore the in\ufb02uence of mortality parameters that\nextend the time spent on one part of the limit cycle, or that\nshut off thephytoplanktonbloom, or that limit the importance\nof the larger species in the system.\n1.1. Mortality parameters\nExamination of the in\ufb02uence of mortality parameters on\necosystem model dynamics is also interesting and important\nin the context of modelling ecosystem responses to climate\nchange. It is reasonable to assume that most anthropogeni-\ncally unperturbed ecosystems, and most organisms within\nthem, are well adapted to their ambient environment, and\nin particular to the ambient temperature. Generally there-\nfore, species aremaintained near the centre of their ecological\nniches. Any change in climate (warming or cooling) will have\nthe effect of moving species from the optimal position in their\necological niche; where they have a relatively high reproduc-\ntion rate and a relatively low mortality rate, to a less-optimal\nposition where, for instance, reproduction is reduced and\nmortality increased. The response of ecosystem models to\nincreases in mortality rate is therefore useful as an indicator\nof the in\ufb02uence of climate change, and also of the suitability of\nparticular ecosystem models for applications in Earth System\nModels used to predict global climate change.\nMortality terms have also been identi\ufb01ed as being impor-\ntant determinants of ecosystem model dynamics (Steele and\nHenderson, 1992; Fulton et al., 2003). Although many forms of\nmortality have been proposed for use in ecosystem models,\nlinear mortality forms are often used because they are sim-\nple, require only one parameter each (parameters are often\npoorly known), and there are little empirical data to supportU\nPlease cite this article in press as: Cropp, R., Norbury, J., Investigations into\nchange scenarios, Ecol.

The choice of the form of closure terms has also\nbeen shown to have an important in\ufb02uence on the dynam-\nics of simple ecosystem models (Steele and Henderson, 1992;\nEdwards and Yool, 2000). These studies found that simple (i.e.\nthree-compartment, oftenNPZ) ecosystemmodels with linear\nclosure termsweremore likely to exhibit oscillatory behaviour\n(i.e. have limit cycles) than were the same models with other\nclosure terms.We therefore chose to examine the in\ufb02uence of\nall the linear mortality terms in the model.\nTheGMSKmodel presents an interesting case for the exam-\nination of the in\ufb02uence of linear closure terms as the GMSK\nlimit cycle may be considered the sum of the dynamics of its\nsub-models even though the full problem is highly non-linear.\nIt is also particularly useful for the examination of the in\ufb02u-\nence of mortality terms on model dynamics as its component\nsub-models both have linear closure terms but have very dif-\nferent dynamics. The NPZ sub-model has an asymptotically\nstable steady state while the BFN sub-model has a limit cycle\n(Cropp et al., 2004).\nWe initially explore varying three mortality parameters of\nthe GMSK model; k10 which controls the in\ufb02uence of the bac-\nteria mortality term k10B; k13 which controls the in\ufb02uence of\nthe zoo\ufb02agellate mortality term k123F and is the linear closure\nterm of the BFN sub-model; and k19 which controls the in\ufb02u-\nence of the zooplankton mortality term k19Z and is the linear\nclosure term for the NPZ sub-model. We note that the in\ufb02u-\nenceof k19 is quite different to that of theother linearmortality\nterms; unlike k10 and k13 which control the rate of switching\nbetween the sub-models k19 has no effect on the switching\nbehaviour.\nWe examine the in\ufb02uence of varying these parameters over\na substantial range (4\u20131000% of measured values). Species in\ntheir optimal position have a low mortality rate compared to\ntheir reproductive rate: moving them from this position has\nthe effect of lowering their reproduction rate and increasing\ntheir mortality rate. It is reasonable therefore, in a model in\nwhich the mortality rates are scaled relative to a reproduction\nrate, to examine the in\ufb02uence of quite large increases in mor-\ntality rates. The robustness of the model dynamics, in which\nthe limit cycle or attractor is maintained over large regions\nof the parameter space, and only subtly changes shape in\nresponse to parameter variations, is of ecological interest.\n1.2.

How-\nver we also \ufb01nd that the GMSK model\u2019s response to climate\nhange scenarios is very sensitive to the representation of\nortality terms. The GMSK model and a subtly amended\nMSK model make quite different predictions about ecosys-\nem responses to climate change: the former predicts an\nutotroph-dominated ecosystem, while the latter predicts the\nxtinction of all life. The primary function of our GMSK model\ns to estimate DMS production by ecological systems when\nubject to climate change. This is because DMS production\ntself feeds back on climate change. The above-mentioned\nwo outcomes predict profoundly different DMS production\nn warmer climates: the \ufb01rst autotroph-dominated outcome\nredicts a continuous, strong negative feedback on global\narming, whereas the second outcome predicts the extinc-\nion of life and a run-away greenhouse effect.\nThis result suggests that great caremust be taken in select-\nng ecological models used to predict the impacts of events\nuch as climate change that affect the processes represented\nn themodels. Formore local systems, our results suggest that\nhe addition of nutrients to otherwise stable plankton ecosys-\nems (as humans invariably do with sewage discharges and\ngricultural run-off) could fundamentally change the dynam-\ncs of those ecosystems from phytoplankton-controlled to\nicrobe-controlled.\nOf independentmathematical interest,we see that the \ufb02ow\nf this four-dimensional system always lies on the intersec-\nion of the positive orthant in B, F,N, P, Z spacewith the hyper-\nlane B+ F+N+P+Z=1 (the state variables are normalised so\nhat the total amount ofmatter in nitrogen currency is 1). This\nour-dimensional system together with possible parameter\nariation and solution state bifurcation, for most parameter\nalues, appears to possess a very stable periodic orbitwith dra-\natically different behaviour on different parts of the (highly\non-linear) orbit. Asymptotically stable states and apparently\nhaotic motion can also be found in the parameter regimes\nhat we explored. We \ufb01nally note that the attributes of the\nMSKmodel are largely described by the sum of the attributes\nf its sub-models in spite of the non-linear linkages of these\nodels and their (highly) non-linear solutions.\n.

It also eventuates that the B and Fmortality terms control\nthe switching between Mode A and Mode B.\n3.2. Switching behaviour\nFigs. 2 and 3 do not reveal an important feature of the model,\nthe fact that the system spends very different amounts of time\nin the respective modes. This is evident in time series such as\nFig. 4a and b, where the system is in Mode Awhen oscillations\nin the panel (a) are decaying towards an equilibrium, and in\nMode B when the B and F populations undergo bloom events\n(see panel (b)) that comprise a single bloom-and-bust cycle\nthat \u201cresets\u201d the oscillatory decay of the P and Z blooms in\nMode A.\nThe system \ufb02ips from Mode A to Mode B when B escapes\nthe control of F. As themaximumrate of Fpredation on B (k8) is\nrelatively large, and near maximum growth is achieved at low\nB levels due to the relatively low value of F\u2032s half-saturation\nconstant of B (k9), this only occurs after both B and F have\nfallen to very low levels and the F growth term k8(B/B+ k9)F in\nEq. (2) is very small. As F will graze B to low levels rapidly due\nto the relatively large value of k8 this time scalewill essentially\nbe controlled by the F mortality term k13, as at low levels of B,\nF will decay like:\nF = FBmine\u2212k13(t\u2212tBmin ) (10)\nOnce Fhasdecayed tonear-zeroB canbegin to growand switch\nthe system from Mode A to Mode B. The timing of this switch-\ning is therefore dependent on themagnitude of k13 (Fig. 4e and\nf). During the period that B is prevented from blooming by F,\nthe system has approached the centre of the spiral in Fig. 2.\nAt this point N, P and Z are approximately constant and F is\napproximately zero. From Eq. (2) we can see that B growth can\nnow be described by:\ndB\ndt\n= (C\u2217 \u2212 k10)B, (11)\nwhere C* is a constant and represents the coef\ufb01cients of the\n\ufb01rst two terms in Eq.

Increases\nin k10 (i.e. k10 \u2192C*) cause the system to spend a longer period\nin Mode A before \ufb02ipping into Mode B. There are therefore at\nleast two characteristic time scales operating in the model to\n\ufb02ip the system dynamics between Mode A and Mode B. After\nthe system has attracted to the vicinity of CP 3 (see Fig. 2),\nand N, P and Z are relatively unchanging, the transition from\nMode A toMode B, related to the decay of the F population and\nsubsequent bloom of the B population, occurs on a time scale\nproportional to k10 and inversely proportional to k13.\nVariations in Z mortality cause the model to respond in a\nvery different manner to variations in the other two mortal-\nity rates (Fig. 5). Although k19 does not affect the switching\nbehaviour, it can affect the timing of the system dynamics,\nwith the frequency of oscillation increasing as k19 is reduced.\nThis parameter also has other, rather surprising effects; an\ninteresting consequence of reducing k19 is that the system\nappears to gain a \u201cmemory\u201d. Fig. 4a and b shows that for mea-\nsured parameter values the system \u201cresets\u201d to a state near CP 1U\nPlease cite this article in press as: Cropp, R., Norbury, J., Investigations into\nchange scenarios, Ecol. Model. (2006), doi:10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2006.09.021\n(see Fig. 2) where the biotic compartments are very small, and\nnearly everything exists as inorganic nutrient. However, Fig. 5a\nand b reveals that when k19 is very small, after the BFN cycle\nhas perturbed the NPZ cycle, the system returns to a point oname row and column in Table 3. Eigenvectors are described in BFPZ\nits NPZ trajectory where it would have been had it not been\nperturbed.\nThe system now exhibits a new Mode C that might be\ndescribed as a combination ofModes A and B.Mode C is essen-\ntially a BFNZ system: after a brief P bloom Z consumes P and\nthen decays like e\u2212k19t while N grows like ek19t. This transfer\nis intermittently perturbed by B growing on N, which subse-\nquently initiates an F bloom that rapidly consumes all of the B\nresource before decaying as e\u2212k13t. After F has decayed the sys-\ntem returns to near its previous position in the N\u2013Z transfer,\nin fact the place it would have been had it not been perturbed\nby the B bloom. Mode C therefore exhibits a \u201cmemory\u201d where\nit returns from Mode B to its previous position rather than\nresetting via CP 1.\nReduction of k19 also pushes the system into a state that\nappears potentially chaotic (Fig. 5c and d). However, numerical\ncalculation of the Lyapunov exponents of the system for low\nvalues of k19 using the method of Wolfe et al. (1985) reveals\nthat the system at no time becomes truly chaotic. Fig. 5e and f\nalso reveals that as k19 is increased the resilience, ameasure of\nthe rate at which the system attracts back to the critical pointECOMOD 4512 1\u201321\na plankton populationmodel: Mortality and its importance in climate\nafter a perturbation (DeAngelis, 1980), of the NPZ system of 404\nMode A increases dramatically.

Evaluations\nof Eq. (43) reveal that the \ufb01rst event to occur as k13 is increased\nis that CP 4 changes from an unstable spiral to a stable spiral\npoint in a Hopf bifurcation (con\ufb01rmed by numerical inspec-\ntion of the vanishing limit cycle about CP 4) when k13 = 1.653.\nThis stability property is maintained until k13 = 1.760 when CP\n4 changes again, this time from a stable spiral to a stable node.\nThis property holds until CP 4 collides with CP 5 in a transcrit-\nical bifurcation when F\u22174 = 0 which from Eq.

(51) and CP 4, previously a stable node, simul-\ntaneously becomes a saddle point and infeasible.\nThe direction \ufb01eld of the BFN sub-model for measured\nparameter values (Fig. 7) is characterised by the ubiquity of\nnear horizontal \ufb02ows pushing B towards zero throughout the\nfeasible state space, and the location of all critical points at or\nin the vicinity of F=0. This is due to the in\ufb02uence of the high\nmaximum rate of F predation on B.

A\nurther seven critical points described by these equations are\nocated in ecologically unrealistic regions of the state space\nnd are not considered. The locations of the seven feasible\nritical points for measured parameter values are given in\nable 2, and are shown in Figs. 2 and 3. These critical points\nppear to substantially control the shape of the GMSKmodel\u2019s\nimit cycle.\nTable 2 and Figs. 2 and 3 reveal that the seven feasible crit-\ncal points of the model form three pairs of closely aligned\noints: CP 3 and 7 lie very close, as do CP 1 and 4, and CP 2 and\n. CP 5 is unique in the GMSKmodel in that it is a lone feasible\nritical point for measured parameter values. The locations of\nost of the critical points can, however, be expected to change\nn response to variations in the parameters of interest, the\nortality rates of B, F and Z, k10, k13 and k19. Eqs.

The nature of the system dynamics in\nthe regions near the critical points varies depending on the\nnumber of real and complex eigenvalues each point has, and\nthe direction in which the associated eigenvectors point. Val-\nues for the numerically calculated eigenvalues of each of the\ncritical points for the measured parameter values are given in\nTable 3, and thenumerically calculated eigenvectors inTable 4.\nEigenvectors of selected large magnitude positive (out-\nward pointing) and negative (inward pointing) eigenvalues are\nshown for each critical point in Figs. 2 and 3. The eigenvectors\nat each critical point were calculated numerically from the\n\ufb01ve-equation system to enable the eigenvectors to be plotted\nin both NPZ and BFN spaces (this calculation always resulted\nin one zero eigenvalue, which is ignored). The lengths of the\neigenvectors have been approximately scaled by the largest\nmagnitude eigenvalue at each critical point.\nThe importance of the critical points CP 3 and CP 7 is appar-\nent in Fig. 2. CP 3 is located near the centre of the spiral in the\nNPZ simplex plane,with CP 7 nearby just off the simplex plane.\nInterestingly, it is the critical point CP 3 (with B\u22173, F\n\u2217\n3 = 0) that\ncontrols the dynamics of the GMSK model, rather than the\ncritical point CP 7 that has all species extant. Although the\ndominant eigenvectors of both CP 3 and CP 7 direct the \ufb02ow\noff the NPZ simplex plane and towards the origin of the NPZ\nspace, the dominant eigenvalue of CP 3 is two orders of mag-\nnitude larger than the real part of the dominant eigenvalue\nof CP 7, and the \ufb02ow is observed to leave the simplex plane\nalong the dominant eigenvector of CP 3 rather than that of CP\n7. However, we note that the system is never actually on the\nsimplex planes as B and F in the case of the NPZ plane, and P\nand Z in the case of the BFN plane (Fig. 3) are very small but\nnever exactly zero; for ease of discussion we will not labour\nthis distinction.\nThe dominant eigenvector of CP 3 in BFN space directs the\nsystem towards CP 5 and \u2018onto\u2019 the BFN simplex plane. The\ntrajectory is captured by the attracting eigenvector of CP 5 and\nthen directed on to CP 1 and CP 4 by its repelling eigenvector.\nFig. 3 reveals that this eigenvector directs the \ufb02ow approxi-\nmately orthogonally to the attracting eigenvectors of CP 1 and\nCP 4 giving the appearance that a further critical point lies at\napproximately F=0.3, N=0.7, P, B, Z=0. However, this is not\nthe case as B has a large negative \ufb02ux and F and N have large\npositive \ufb02uxes in this region, indicating that the dynamics are\ncontrolled by the eigenvectors of CP 1, CP 4 and CP 5 and the\nmass conservation boundary.\n3.6.

This bifurcation point is unaffected by\nthe simultaneous variations in k10 and k13. At this point also\nthe eigenvalues of all the critical points all become real. For\nmortality parameter values greater than 1.111, the only other\necologically feasible critical point is CP 1 (N\u22171 = 1). This critical\npoint has one positive eigenvalue (\u0002CP 1\u22121 = k23/1 + k24) that is\ninsensitive to all mortality parameter perturbations, indicat-\ning that CP 1 is always unstable.\nFig. 11 summarises the results of the bifurcation analy-\nsis, and demonstrates the robustness of the system\u2019s limit\ncycle dynamics to variations in k10, k13 or k19. The mortality\nparameters generally require substantial variations in value\nbefore fundamentally affecting the dynamics. The B mortal-\nity (k10) causes the earliest change, with a bifurcation from\nthe limit cycle to a stable spiral at 1.75 times its measured\nvalue. When all parameters are varied together, this bifur-\ncation occurs at a slightly higher value of k10 (1.96 times its\nmeasured value). The Z mortality (k19) is the next most sensi-\ntive parameter, with a similar bifurcation from the limit cycle\nto a stable spiral occurring at six times itsmeasured value. The\nlocation of this bifurcation point is unaffected by variations\nin the other mortality parameters. The limit cycle dynam-\nics are relatively insensitive to variations in the F mortality\n(k13), with the \ufb01rst bifurcation occurring at nine times the\nmeasured value, and the second at approximately 10 times.\nUnlike the bifurcations due to k10 and k19 these bifurcations\ndo not occur when all mortality parameters are varied simul-\ntaneously.\n3.6.5. An amended model\nThe stability scenario described above raises an interesting\nquestion, for a simultaneous increase in mortality parame-\nters is exactly the circumstance that ensues when ecosystems\nare subject to climate change, and species are pushed to the\nlimits of their thermal ecological niches and beyond. How-\never, our result that predicts an outcome where P is the only\nsurvivor appears to be a result of the model formulation not\nincluding an explicit mortality term for P. This is often implic-\nitly included by assuming that the maximum P growth rate\nhas been reduced by P\u2019s natural mortality.

CP 1 then becomes the long-term state\nf the system for highmortality rates. There is therefore a fun-\namental difference between the climate change responses of\nhe GMSK and amended GMSKmodels: the former predicts an\nutotroph-dominated ecosystem, while the latter predicts the\nxtinction of all life.\nThe amended GMSK model also has a more realistic sta-\nility criterion for the critical point CP 1, where all living\nomponents of the system have died. Eqs. (116)\u2013(119) indicate\nhat the stability of this point is controlled by the mortal-\nty terms of the four biotic components. Eqs. (118) and (119)\neveal that while the heterotrophs, the zoo\ufb02agellates (F) and\nooplankton (Z), have non-zero mortality CP 1 is potentially\ntable. The stability of this point is then determined by the\nrowth/mortality ratios of the autotrophs, the bacteria (B) and\nhe phytoplankton (P). While either of these has a growth\nate that exceeds its mortality rate, CP 1 will be unstable and\nife will persist. Note that the stability of CP 1 is not affected\ny grazing parameters, suggesting that dynamics induced by\nrazing behaviours are self-regulating and will not result in\nhe extinction of life in the absence external forces.U\nPlease cite this article in press as: Cropp, R., Norbury, J., Investigations into a\nchange scenarios, Ecol.

Clearly, the GMSK model can\nreproduce observed data (Gabric et al., 2003; Cropp et al., 2004),\nand the modi\ufb01ed GMSK model is capable of reproducing the\nsame data, albeit with slightly modi\ufb01ed parameter values.\nHowever, these models would produce very different results\nif used to simulate the effects of global warming that pushed\ntheir constituent organisms to the limits of their respective\necological niches.\n4. Conclusions\nThe GMSK model has a complicated, interesting and quite\nrobust limit cycle that essentially comprises two modes of\nbehaviour that we have called Mode A and Mode B. The\nrobustness of this limit cycle is of profound importance to\nthe model\u2019s application in predicting the impacts of climate\nchange and the potential for marine ecosystems to amelio-\nrate that change by the production of DMS. This is because\nDMS is produced in Mode A and consumed in Mode B.\nWe found that the switching between Modes A and B was\ncontrolled by the coef\ufb01cients of two linear mortality terms of\nbacteria and zoo\ufb02agellates, k10 and k13. These had similar (but\ninverse) effects on the timing of the switching betweenmodes,\nbut had very different in\ufb02uences on solution state bifurca-\ntions, and the ultimate state of the model for large mortality\nparameter perturbations. We also found that the other lin-\near mortality term in the model that of zooplankton, k19, had\nquite different effects on the switching behaviour. Cropp et al.\n(2004) noted that this was an important term for dimethylsul-\nphide production, andhence potential amelioration of climate\nchange, but for different reasons.\nThe GMSK model may be decomposed into an NPZ sub-\nmodel and a BFN sub-model. Our analysis has demonstrated\nthat the GMSK model may be usefully described by the sum\nof its two component sub-models. The dynamics of each of\nthese sub-models combine to form the GMSK model\u2019s limit\ncycle. The shape of this limit cycle is largely determined by\nthe location and stability properties of the critical points. The\ncritical points of the sub-models contributemost of the critical\npoints of the full model, and although the GMSK model has\ntwo additional critical points in its own right, the dynamics\nof the full model appear to be controlled by the critical points\nof the sub-models. Further, the bifurcations observed in the\nsub-models are also evident in the full model, although the\nbehaviour in the full model is not as \u201cclean\u201d as observed in the\nsub-models. This suggests that insight into the behaviour of\ncomplicated ecosystem models might be assisted by analysis\nof any smaller sub-models into which they may reasonably be\ndecomposed.\nThe NPZ and BFN sub-models add an interesting dimen-\nsion to the discussion in recent ecological literature on the\nrole of closure terms in in\ufb02uencing the dynamics of ecological\nmodels (Edwards and Yool, 2000).

However we do note that the coef\ufb01cients of linear mor-\ntality terms and linear closure terms are important bifurcation\nparameters.\nOur results also point to the importance of bacteria in\nthe dynamics of ecosystem models. The presence of bacte-\nria destabilises the plankton model, and bacterial blooms are\nobserved to occur more frequently if bacterial mortality is low\nor if nutrient levels are high. The presence of a bacterial preda-\ntor however effectively controls the bacterial population, and\nrestricts the potential for microbial systems to dominate to a\nsmall region of parameter space.\nWe have also highlighted the importance of subtle vari-\nations in model formulation if the model is to be used in\nscenarios such as climate change that dictate that parame-\nter values must change. The inclusion of an explicit linear P\nmortality term to the GMSK model produces only subtle mod-\ni\ufb01cations to the dynamics for measured parameter values.\nMurray and Parslow (1999) have noted the importance of the\nformulation of the P mortality term in simple NP models, not-\ning that in the absence of explicit Z representation P mortality\nis a surrogate of the Z mortality of NPZ models. AlthoughMur-\nray and Parslow used their models to investigate the effects\nof nutrient load on coastal ecosystems, they noted that the\nform of the Pmortality term could also determine the stability\nproperties of steady state solutions.WhileMurray and Parslow\nconsidered some P mortality formulations to be inconsistent\nwith observed ecosystem dynamics, the inclusion a linear P\nmortality term to the GMSKmodel does not affect themodel\u2019s\nability to reproduce observed ecosystem dynamics, but may\nhave a profound impact on the model\u2019s behaviour when it is\nused in a climate change scenario.\nThus our original and amended models are virtually indis-\ntinguishable for our presently observed (experimental) param-\neter values, but when the climate changes, these models\npredict totally different outcomes. Our originalmodel predicts\na cycling or static autotroph-dominated outcome, whereas\nthe amended model predicts a global extinction. In terms of\nDMS production, which feeds back on climate change, these\ntwo outcomes are profoundly different: the \ufb01rst autotroph-\ndominated outcome predicts a continuous, strong negative\nfeedback on global warming, whereas the second outcome\npredicts the extinction of life and a run-away greenhouse\neffect. These very similar models therefore provide explicit\nexamples where the choice of ecological models for inclusion\nin climate change simulations could dramatically affect the\nsimulation results.\nAppendix A.

At the same time, the assessment of climate change impacts on the hydrolog-15\nical cycle based on projections of Global Climate Models (GCMs) dynamically down-\nscaled by RCM nesting has been a major research effort, especially in the past decade\n(Bergstrom et al., 2001; Horton et al., 2006; Graham et al., 2007; Andersson et al.,\n2011). Although most RCMs include descriptions of surface and subsurface runoff pro-\ncesses, biases in precipitation and moisture fluxes generally result in weak agreement20\nbetween RCM runoff and observations (Hagemann et al., 2004; van den Hurk et al.,\n2005). Therefore, most studies have used a model chain consisting of a combination\nof GCM(s) and RCM(s), various methods to correct biases and a hydrological model\n(HyM) to project potential future changes in water resources and runoff, as summarized\nin Teutschbein and Seibert (2010).25\nClimate science has increased our understanding of the climate system consider-\nably, yet the uncertainty of projections of regional climate changes is still large and\n10207\nHESSD\n9, 10205\u201310243, 2012\nOn the need for bias\ncorrection in regional\nclimate scenarios\nM.

Besides the uncertainties due to imperfect climate models (process\ndescriptions, parameters and boundary conditions) there is considerable uncertainty\nabout future greenhouse gas emissions and the natural variability of the climate system\n(Foley, 2010). An estimate of the latter source is created by varying the initial conditions5\nof the GCM that forces a particular RCM, so the results of each of these GCM-RCM\nmembers span the range of internal variability of a particular GCM-RCM combination,\nas reported for example in de El\u00b4\u0131a and Co\u02c6te\u00b4 (2010). Then again, the uncertainty of the\nemissions scenarios seems to be not that important for global warming until the late\n21st century and beyond (Hawkins and Sutton, 2009).10\nA few studies have already compared the impact of these different sources of un-\ncertainty on the hydrological response of regional scale catchments or on the vari-\nables most important for hydrological models, precipitation and temperature. De\u00b4que\u00b4 et\nal. (2007) compared the effect of different sources of uncertainty, including the emis-\nsions scenario, the choice of GCM and RCM, and varied initial conditions on seasonal15\nprecipitation and temperature over Europe. They found that the uncertainty arising from\ndifferent GCMs is generally the largest, while the choice of RCM strongly affected sum-\nmer precipitation and the choice of emissions scenario had a significant effect only\non summer temperatures. Horton et al. (2006) used a similar set of climate model\nsimulations for a hydrological impact study over the Swiss Alps and found that the un-20\ncertainty introduced by the choice of RCM is not explicitly deductible from the climatic\nensembles, hence it is assumed to be in the order of the GCM uncertainty. Graham et\nal. (2007) found that the choice of GCM is more important than the emissions scenario\nor the RCM used in their multi-catchment study on future (2071\u20132100) hydrological\nchange. The assessment of the uncertainty components in water related variables for25\nclimate change projections showed that the climate system internal variability is a major\nplayer for impact studies at the watershed scale (Music and Caya, 2007, 2009; Braun\net al., 2011).\n10208\nHESSD\n9, 10205\u201310243, 2012\nOn the need for bias\ncorrection in regional\nclimate scenarios\nM.

Within the Que\u00b4bec-Bavarian International Collaboration on Climate Change\n(QBic3) project four regional scale catchments strongly affected by different types of\nhydraulic infrastructure (dams, reservoirs, water transfer systems) are investigated. Be-5\ncause the uncertainty connected to any projections of climate change impacts on runoff\ncharacteristics has to be quantified, a modeling chain of both multiple climate scenar-\nios and hydrological models is employed. The general aim of the projections for the\nBavarian and Que\u00b4be\u00b4cois catchments is to investigate the long-term changes in the an-\nnual runoff regime and the average change in high and low flow characteristics during10\ndifferent seasons. The projected changes are then fed into water management models\nto simulate the effects of these changes on the water infrastructure and to investigate\npotential adaptation options.\nSince the ensemble of hydrological models includes both, simple, lumped as well as\nmore complex, distributed models, physically consistent and spatially distributed me-15\nteorological inputs are needed for runoff projection. Furthermore, additional variables\nbesides temperature and precipitation (e.g. humidity and global radiation) at the sub-\ndaily time scale are needed. Following the findings summarized in Maraun et al. (2010),\ndynamical downscaling of global climate projections is an adequate approach to fulfill\nthese needs. Although there are other options in the wide field of statistical downscaling20\nmethods, the use of RCM data furthermore offers the advantage that it preserves the\nphysical coherence between atmospheric variables, especially between precipitation\nand temperature (Fowler et al., 2007).\nYet, as the spatial resolution of distributed hydrological models usually applied on\nmanaged watersheds is distinctly finer than that of typical RCM applications, further25\ndownscaling is required if regional to local scale patterns are to be resolved by the\nimpact models (Maraun et al., 2010). Especially in terrain with steep gradients, the\ndistribution of RCM outputs to the impact model scale based on elevation can improve\n10209\nHESSD\n9, 10205\u201310243, 2012\nOn the need for bias\ncorrection in regional\nclimate scenarios\nM.

(2000).\nStill, RCM data may contain biases that prevent an appropriate reproduction of the\nhistoric (observed) hydrological conditions from simulations (which is the \u2019minimum\nstandard\u2019 as stated in Wood et al. (2004) for a \u201cuseful\u201d downscaling technique). There-5\nfore, in most cases some form of bias correction is necessary, especially for precipita-\ntion (Maraun et al., 2010) but also for temperature. A full integration of both downscaling\nand bias correction is reported in Kleinn et al. (2005), who constructed a model chain\nfor the large Rhine basin upstream Cologne (145 000 km2) by forcing the distributed\nhydrological model WASIM with bias-corrected RCM fields. To account for fine scale10\nheterogeneities in complex terrain they used a model interface that superimposes sta-\ntionary, topography-induced patterns of the hydrological model scale on the coarse\nscale RCM temperature and precipitation fields.\nBias correction of RCM outputs typically make use of one of two general approaches:\nextracting deltas to modify observed meteorological data for a future time period or de-15\nrive scaling parameters to adjust both past and future RCM outputs to more closely\nfit observed climatic conditions (Teutschbein and Seibert, 2010). Different variations\nof those are summarized in De\u00b4que\u00b4 (2007). Fowler et al. (2007) state that the phys-\nical coherence between temperature and precipitation is largely preserved in bias-\ncorrected RCM data, although this certainly depends on the methods used for those20\nvariables. Furthermore, bias correction can affect the absolute and/or the relative tem-\nporal change of a meteorological variable. For example, Graham et al. (2007) have\nshown that the delta method preserves the average change in precipitation from the\nRCM data, while a scaling of precipitation intensity better preserves the changes in vari-\nability. So in summary, bias correction of RCM simulations does not guarantee physical25\nconsistency and may affect the climate change signal to some extent. Hence the use\nof bias correction techniques in hydrology to adjust GCM or RCM data is disputed, as\ndiscussed by Ehret et al. (2012). So the question we try to address in this paper is:\n10210\nHESSD\n9, 10205\u201310243, 2012\nOn the need for bias\ncorrection in regional\nclimate scenarios\nM. J.

Precipitation is corrected by the Local Intensity Scaling (LOCI) method\nof Schmidli et al. (2006), while air temperature is modified by monthly additive factors.\nRiver runoff is simulated both with direct and bias-corrected meteorological drivers\nproduced by RCMs. The runoff regimes simulated for the past and the hydrological10\nindicators derived from this daily runoff, characterizing mean, high and low flows as\nwell as the timing of the spring flood, are evaluated compared to observations. Then,\nthe results of the model chain with and without bias correction are analyzed regarding\nthe relative change of hydrological indicators for the future time period. Furthermore,\nthe impact of the applied bias correction methods on hydrological indicators in relation15\nto the actual biases of the available regional climate simulations is examined.\n2 Data and methods\n2.1 The investigated catchments\nThe two catchments investigated in this study, the au Saumon and the Loisach River,\nare both natural flow tributaries of larger, heavily managed watersheds located in20\nSouthern Que\u00b4bec (Canada) and Southern Bavaria (Germany) respectively. The au\nSaumon River at gauge Saumon has a catchment area of 738 km2, while the Loisach\nRiver at gauge Schlehdorf has an area of 640 km2. Thus, both are relatively small for\nclimate change modeling studies and their mountainous character with a strong relief\nand raw soils mainly covered by forests leads to distinct runoff regimes. As stated be-25\nfore, both are important tributaries for two larger river systems, the Haut Saint-Franc\u00b8ois\n10211\nHESSD\n9, 10205\u201310243, 2012\nOn the need for bias\ncorrection in regional\nclimate scenarios\nM.

Yet, these larger systems are highly regulated by dams, reservoirs and water\ntransfer systems, so climate change impact on river runoff cannot be easily quantified\nwithout taking water management into account.\nThe au Saumon catchment topography is moderately steep, with elevation rang-5\ning from 1100m at Mont Me\u00b4gantic to 270m at the catchment outlet. Land cover is\ndominated by deciduous forest that grows on silt loam soils overlying the Appalachian\nbedrock. The annual overall mean flow at the outlet is 18m3 s\u22121, yet the nivo-pluvial\nrunoff regime is dominated by a large snow-melt peak in spring (54m3 s\u22121 in April). Al-\nthough precipitation in summer is slightly higher than in winter; only intense convective10\nprecipitation events can create low magnitude summer floods. In general, flows are low\nin summer due to high evaporation and occasional dry spells (10m3 s\u22121 in August) and\nalso in winter due to low temperatures and a long lasting snow cover.\nMost of the Loisach catchment upstream of gauge Schlehdorf is located in the Bavar-\nian Limestone Alps; therefore the relief is steep with elevations ranging from 2962m at15\nthe Zugspitze to 600m at the catchment outlet. Land use is dominated by coniferous\nforests with small parts of marshland, pasture and rocky outcrops. Raw soils on lime-\nstone are common in the mountains, while in the low-lying parts loamy soils with parts\nof gravel are found. The glacial runoff regime of the Loisach is controlled by snowmelt\nin late spring and precipitation events in summer. Mean annual runoff is 22m3 s\u22121 with20\na minimum in winter and a maximum in spring and early summer, when the snowmelt\nin the mountains gives way to the precipitation maximum in summer.\n2.2 The hydro-climatic model chain\nThe QBic3 project investigates the impact of climate change on water resources with\na focus on the models-related uncertainties regarding the future changes in runoff25\nregime.

Typically, the uncertain-\nties and potential errors in RCM simulations are related to emission scenarios, climate\nmodel structure and parameterization, but also the natural variability of climate (Foley,\n2010). So, similar to other investigations (as summarized for example in Teutschbein\nand Seibert, 2010) the climate model simulation ensembles are produced from different5\nsimulations of global and regional climate models for both catchments (see Sect. 2.3).\nAs RCM simulations are usually biased when compared to observations, the two main\ndrivers for hydrological models (HyMs), precipitation and temperature, are corrected to\nbetter fit the observed climatology. Finally, all RCM fields are downscaled for the dis-\ntributed hydrological models using the statistical scaling tool SCALMET (Marke, 2008),10\nwhich conserves mass and energy at the RCM scale. This dualistic approach regard-\ning bias correction and downscaling of RCM outputs is followed in order to separately\nestimate the impact of bias correction on HyM results without having to account for\nchanges in spatial distribution of these variables.\nBesides the climate model uncertainties, an ensemble of hydrological models of dif-15\nferent complexity is required as well to reflect the predictive uncertainties of hydro-\nlogical modeling (see e.g. Vela\u00b4zquez et al., 2012). Hence, a so called hydro-climatic\nsimulation ensemble of simulated runoff time series for both a reference (1971\u20132000)\nand a future period (2041\u20132070) is produced by feeding different hydrological models\nwith a suite of climate simulations. The chosen ensemble of hydrological models (see20\nSect. 2.4) reflects different levels of model complexity and assesses the uncertainty\nrelated to model structure (i.e., the uncertainty related to the internal computation of\nhydrological processes). From those daily runoff time series, four hydrological indica-\ntors (HI) are calculated:\n1. Mean Flow over the whole period (MF): mean of all daily values in m3 s\u22121 over25\na given period; this indicator mainly reflects the annual water balance of a catch-\nment.\n10213\nHESSD\n9, 10205\u201310243, 2012\nOn the need for bias\ncorrection in regional\nclimate scenarios\nM.

High Flow with a 2-yr return period (HF2): the flood peak, which statistically occurs5\nevery two years is based on seasonal (summer, winter) maximum daily runoff\nvalues; again a Pearson III-type distribution is assumed (DVWK, 1979).\n4.

On that basis and by comparison\nwith observed runoff values, three main questions are raised:\n\u2013 Question 1: Does bias correction provide a more consistent representation of river\nrunoff for the past?20\nThis first analysis compares the deviation of the simulated runoff and hydrolog-\nical indicators from observed values over the reference period. It assesses the\ncapacity of a hydro-climatic simulation ensemble to provide a consistent repre-\nsentation of the river runoff regime. This analysis is based on (a) the simulated\naverage annual hydrographs compared to the observed runoff regime and (b) the25\nquantification of the relative errors (E ) of hydrological indicators simulated with\nhydro-climatic model chain for the reference period (HIRef) compared to those\ncomputed from observed flow (HIObs)\n10214\nHESSD\n9, 10205\u201310243, 2012\nOn the need for bias\ncorrection in regional\nclimate scenarios\nM.

It evaluates the relevance\nof applying time consuming bias correction methods in the scope of hydrological\nclimate change impact assessment. The rank-sum Wilcoxon (1945) test is used15\nin order to compare pairs of (hydrological) change signal ensembles obtained\nwith either direct or bias corrected RCM drivers. For each hydrological indicator,\nwe evaluate if the two samples (BC0 and BC1) have been drawn from the same\ndistribution (the null hypothesis) within different rejection levels. Commonly, the\n5% level is used, but in this study other additional significance levels were also20\nchosen to get a gradual estimate of sample similarity. If the test is not rejected,\nboth distributions should provide the same information, and thus bias correction of\nprecipitation and temperature should not be necessary to evaluate a given change\nsignal.\n10215\nHESSD\n9, 10205\u201310243, 2012\nOn the need for bias\ncorrection in regional\nclimate scenarios\nM.

The final list that was agreed upon in QBic3 is\npresented in Table 1. The regional climate models are the Canadian Regional Climate5\nModel CRCM4 (de El\u00b4\u0131a and Co\u02c6te\u00b4, 2010; Caya and Laprise, 1999), the KNMI regional\natmospheric climate model (RACMO2) (van Meijgaard, 2008) and the Rossby Centre\u2019s\nRegional atmosphere-land climate model (RCA3) (Samuelsson et al., 2011; Kjellstro\u00a8m\net al., 2011). Driving data for those models are outputs of the global climate models\nCGCM3, ECHAM5, HadCM3 and BCM. A consequence of this particular choice of10\nclimate simulations is that natural variability will be better assessed over Que\u00b4bec (given\nthat 5 members are available) while the uncertainty related to the choice of regional\nclimate models and their pilots will only be exposed over Bavaria. It has to be noted that\nthe uncertainty introduced by greenhouse gas emissions scenarios is not accounted\nfor over Que\u00b4bec and is not well represented over Bavaria, however the spread between15\ndifferent IPCC-SRES scenarios is rather small at the chosen future time frame 2041\u2013\n2070 (Hawkins and Sutton, 2009; Graham et al., 2007).\nThe preparation of climate model data sets as an input for catchment scale hydro-\nlogical models is accomplished by a two-step approach of correcting climate model\nbiases if needed at the RCM grid scale before scaling the outputs to the hydrologi-20\ncal scale of 1\u00d71 km2. As the spatial resolution of common RCM applications is about\n50 km, a Model Output Statistics (MOS) algorithm had to be chosen to disaggregate\nRCM outputs to the hydrological model scale of 1\u00d71 km2. Since the aim of this further\ndownscaling is to reproduce the typical spatial patterns of various meteorological vari-\nables in regions with (potentially) sparse meteorological stations data, the chosen MOS25\napproach SCALMET (Marke, 2008) takes advantage of (a) elevation dependencies al-\nready existent in RCM air temperature and humidity fields, (b) physical relationships\nbetween incoming radiation components respectively wind speeds and topography and\n10216\nHESSD\n9, 10205\u201310243, 2012\nOn the need for bias\ncorrection in regional\nclimate scenarios\nM.

Ultimately, a major advantage of SCALMET is that it conserves energy and\nmass at the spatial scale of the RCM grid boxes during each time step. Furthermore,\nZabel et al. (2012) successfully used SCALMET to interactively couple an RCM with\nthe hydrological land surface model PROMET, which is also used in this study.5\nTo evaluate the main biases of the chosen RCM runs, simulated and downscaled\naverage monthly air temperature and precipitation for both main catchments are com-\npared to interpolated observations in Fig. 3. For Haut Saint-Francois, all members of\nCRCM have a distinct cold bias of the order of 2\u20134 \u25e6C, most accentuated in late winter\nand early spring. This cold bias is also present at a much larger scale in the corre-10\nsponding CGCM simulations (not shown), suggesting that large temperature biases in\nthe driving data propagate through the modeling chain. In terms of mean precipitation,\nthere is a clear underestimation in winter and overestimation in the summer months.\nThese biases are larger than the variation between the CRCM-CGCMmembers, which\nis a first order estimate of the natural variability for this region (less than 1 \u25e6C and 5\u201315\n10mmmonth\u22121). For the Upper Isar region, RCA driven by BCM shows a 2 \u25e6C warm\nbias for summer, while all other RCA and RACMO simulations have biases of less than\n1 \u25e6C year round. Once again, the CRCM driven by CGCM reveals a large cold bias\nof about \u22125 \u25e6C. The precipitation amounts of the RCA and RACMO simulations, re-\ngardless of driving GCMs, overestimate precipitation in winter and underestimate it in20\nsummer, while the CRCM shows a severe underestimation.\nWith these, to some extent large, biases in RCM outputs the hydro-climatic model\nchain is obviously not able to plausibly reproduce observed runoff without any correc-\ntion of climate model biases, as outlined in e.g. Wood et al. (2004). There are however\ndrawbacks to bias correction: (a) as it is statistical in nature, some physical coherence25\nis sacrificed during the process. (b) An assumption is made that the correction param-\neters derived from past data sets still hold for future time periods. In order to separate\nthe impact of bias correction from the downscaling procedure, a monthly correction\nis performed at the RCM grid point scale on air temperature by subtracting the 30-yr\n10217\nHESSD\n9, 10205\u201310243, 2012\nOn the need for bias\ncorrection in regional\nclimate scenarios\nM.

For precipitation the local intensity scaling method (LOCI) of\nSchmidli et al. (2006) is used, which adjusts 30-yr average monthly wet-day frequency\nand intensity (with a wet-day precipitation threshold of 1mm) and was already applied\nto CRCM data sets by Minville et al. (2009) and Chen et al. (2011). Since the LOCI\nmethod was developed for daily data, the resulting daily precipitation is redistributed to5\nthe sub-daily timescale proportionally to the original RCM precipitation for each day in\norder to accommodate for a finer temporal resolution of the model data.\nIt should be noted that total precipitation is not forced to match the observation after\nbias correction using LOCI; only the targeted statistics of the chosen method will fit\nthe same statistics computed from the observations. This is an arbitrary choice. In10\ncases where multiple members are available, a single set of bias correction parameters\nis computed from the statistics of the ensemble and then applied to each individual\nmember in order to retain the modeled natural variability. In all other cases, there is\none set of parameters per climate simulation. The observation data used to compute\nthe reference climatology are the same that were used for calibration and validation15\nof hydrological models over their respective basins. For the Bavarian region, this is\nthe 1-km gridded dataset from the GLOWA-Danube project interpolated with PROMET\n(Mauser and Bach, 2009), for the Haut Saint-Franc\u00b8ois watershed, CEHQ provided their\ngridded observation datasets.\nIn terms of climate change signal from the chosen RCMs for the 2050 horizon, the20\nHaut Saint-Francois region is projected to see its temperature increase by about 3 \u25e6C,\nup to 4 \u25e6C in Winter, with a precipitation increase of up to 30% in the Winter, 20% in\nthe Spring and Fall and a small decrease in the Summer months. For the Upper Isar,\na 1 to 3 \u25e6C increase in temperature is projected, with the larger uncertainty coming\nfrom the choice of multiple RCMs and driving GCMs. The precipitation change signal25\nis mixed, showing a general increase in spring and a decrease in summer for all but\nthe RCA-BCM simulation. Again, the various choices of atmospheric models introduce\na rather large uncertainty of about 20% in the projected precipitation changes. It has\nto be noted that the depicted precipitation changes in Fig. 4 are based on uncorrected\n10218\nHESSD\n9, 10205\u201310243, 2012\nOn the need for bias\ncorrection in regional\nclimate scenarios\nM.

As the LOCI method scales precipitation intensities, the bias corrected\nprecipitation change signal is scaled accordingly with the exception of days with rain-\nfall below the wet-day threshold. Also, it can already be seen that even with its large\nbias with respect to observations in the Upper Isar, the CRCM-CGCM model projected\nclimate change is in line with the other models.5\n2.4 The hydrological model ensemble\nThe hydrological model (HyM) ensemble constructed for the QBic3 project is com-\nposed of four models: HSAMI (Fortin, 2000), HYDROTEL (Fortin et al., 2001), WASIM\n(Schulla and Jasper, 2007) and PROMET (Mauser and Bach, 2009). This ensemble re-\nflects different levels of structural complexity developed by the scientific community as10\ndiscussed in more depth by Vela\u00b4zquez et al. (2012). It ranges from empirical, lumped\nrunoff models to distributed, process-based land surface models. In more detail, the\nstructural complexity of the chosen hydrological models is evaluated according to the\nfollowing characteristics:\n1. The spatial resolution within the ensemble ranges from the lumped model HSAMI15\nvia the semi distributed model HYDROTEL to the fully distributed water budget\nand runoff models WASIM and PROMET.\n2. The computation of evapotranspiration (ET) ranges from empirical estimates of\nthe potential ET (that are reduced afterwards to fit runoff) to process-based al-\ngorithms of the actual ET. (a) PROMET has the most complex ET algorithm of20\nthe ensemble of HyMs consisting of a soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer (SVAT)\nscheme that describes the processes of and the resistances to water, energy and\nradiation transfer with physical and empirical parameters. These resistances are\nused in the Penman-Monteith formula for the calculation of the actual ET. (b) In\nWASIM, merely the potential ET is simulated with the Penman-Monteith equa-25\ntion which is, in a second step, reduced to actual ET as a function of the current\nsoil matrix potential. (c) In HYDROTEL, potential ET is computed either by an\n10219\nHESSD\n9, 10205\u201310243, 2012\nOn the need for bias\ncorrection in regional\nclimate scenarios\nM. J.

Potential ET is then reduced to an actual value based on\nsoil water availability. (d) HSAMI estimates evapotranspiration by an empirical for-\nmulation that was developed especially for the region of Quebec using minimum\nand maximum air temperature only.5\n3. The computation of the soil water balance differs strongly between models.\nWhereas in HYDROTEL a homogeneous distribution of properties over the soil\ncolumn is assumed, the soil modules in WASIM and PROMET describe the soil\ncolumn by different homogenous layers, which reflect the natural layer structure\nof soil horizons. HSAMI plainly uses two calibrated linear reservoirs to represent10\nthe saturated and unsaturated zones.\n4. The computation of snow melt : whereas HSAMI, HYDROTEL and WASIM use a\nsimple temperature index approach for snow melt, PROMET calculates the radia-\ntion and temperature driven snow surface energy balance to compute the built-up\nand ablation of the snow water storage.15\n5. Moreover, because different algorithms of surface processes like snow melt and\nevapotranspiration are employed, the number of required meteorological input\nvariables varies between models. While the more simple models run with daily\nvalues of air temperature and precipitation fields only, WASIM and PROMET ad-\nditionally require wind speed, relative humidity and solar radiation fields.20\nYet, when interpreting the effects of model structure on runoff results, multiple model\ncharacteristics have to be taken into account. For example, although the ET algorithm is\nan important characteristic for the simulation of the catchment water balance, its effect\ncan only be assessed in combination with other model characteristics. Moreover, the\nactual simulated ET also depends on the spatial resolution of land surface properties25\nand the available soil water content.

In distributed mod-\nels, parameters for land cover and soils describe the spatially distributed properties of\nthe land surface. Furthermore, in complex models such as PROMET, projected future\nchanges in ET or snow cover depend on multiple meteorological variables. For exam-\nple, changes in relative humidity or solar radiation may counter or enhance hydrological5\nchange caused by changes in temperature or precipitation characteristics.\nIn climate change research, it is important to note that increasing complexity does\nnot guarantee an increase in HyM performance (the ability to reproduce hydrographs).\nThrough the reduced need for calibration, increasing model complexity is expected to\nenhance the robustness of a model\u2019s representation of the runoff regime in a changed10\nenvironment. Since climate change research assumes a significant drift of the climatic\nregime from the reference period to the future, robustness of parametric information\nis required. Yet, since physically based models are more demanding in computing ca-\npacity and in input data requirements, climate change research needs to optimize the\ntradeoff between complexity and robustness. Within QBic3, Vela\u00b4zquez et al. (2012)15\nhave already explored the added value of using complex models within the HyM en-\nsemble used in this study.\n3 Results and discussion\nTo compare the effect of bias correction with the uncertainty range introduced by cli-\nmate and hydrological models and the natural variability of climate, two ensembles per20\ncatchment are constructed from the models presented before:\n1. At Saumon four HyMs are combined with either the direct (BC0) or bias corrected\n(BC1) meteorological data sets of five members of CRCM driven by CGCM for\n20 members per ensemble (this ensemble allows the estimation of the natural\nvariability of climate over Southern Que\u00b4bec).25\n10221\nHESSD\n9, 10205\u201310243, 2012\nOn the need for bias\ncorrection in regional\nclimate scenarios\nM.

At Schlehdorf four HyMs are combined with seven climate simulations (either BC0\nor BC1) produced with five different combinations of regional and global climate\nmodels for 28 members per ensemble (this ensemble allows estimation of the\nclimate model uncertainty over Southern Germany).\nIn the following, the simulated runoff characteristics of these ensembles are investi-5\ngated during the reference period 1971 to 2000 as well as the change signal of the\nflow indicators between the reference and the future (2041 to 2070) period.\n3.1 Does bias correction provide a more consistent representation of\nriver runoff?\nThe performance of the hydro-climatic simulation ensembles is evaluated by their ca-10\npacity to represent observed hydrology in a consistent way. This is done by comparing\nobserved and simulated hydrographs (Fig. 5) or by evaluating hydrological indicators\n(Fig. 6). This section assesses how biases in our RCM simulations (Fig. 3) affect runoff\nresults and if bias correction is able to provide a better representation of the observed\nhydrograph.15\nFigure 5 presents observed and simulated average monthly discharge values over\nthe reference period. Observed discharges are represented by the red curve, while the\nsimulation results of the hydro-climatic model chain are represented by the shaded en-\nvelope (min-max values). The impact of bias correction on simulated discharges can\nbe seen by comparing Fig. 5a and b for Saumon and Fig. 5d and e for Schlehdorf. In20\nboth cases, the hydro-climatic ensembles produced with BC1 RCM data is closer to\nobserved discharge than the BC0 ensembles. As presented in Fig. 5c and f, the evalu-\nation of the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency confirms the overall better performance of\nBC1 values.\nWhen looking at the details, one can observe that runoff at gauge Saumon is un-25\nderestimated in winter, if simulated with BC0 data. This could be related to the strong\nnegative bias in simulated precipitation for these months (Fig. 3). The BC0 spring flood\n10222\nHESSD\n9, 10205\u201310243, 2012\nOn the need for bias\ncorrection in regional\nclimate scenarios\nM. J.

Moreover, the negative bias in precipitation leads to less\nsnow storage and therefore to smaller spring floods for BC0 than observed. Similarly,\nthe missing flood peak during autumn is due to the underestimation of rainfall in BC0.\nBias correction generally increases simulated runoff during summer and autumn.5\nThe investigation of the envelope of simulated runoff regimes produced with our\nfive members of CRCM-CGCM reveals an interesting effect of bias correction on the\nspread of simulated mean monthly runoff values. As expected, the envelope of the\nBC1 ensemble is shifted towards higher values due to higher annual precipitation sums\n(+60mm). Yet, when looking at seasons, the spread of results, hence the uncertainty10\nstemming from GCM members and HyMs, is smaller during spring in the BC1 case as\ncompared to BC0 and is larger for BC1 during fall and especially winter. Apparently,\nthe cold bias of CRCM results in too low winter runoff for all members of the BC0\nensemble, while plausible winter temperatures seem to produce more realistic, but\nalso more variable flows in the BC1 case. By contrast, corrected winter precipitation15\nsums and air temperatures result in a closer fit of the spring flood peak for BC1, while\nfor BC0 the spring flood peak timing seems to occur between April and May depending\non the simulation.\nThe Schlehdorf runoff regime based on BC0 has a huge spring flood peak that is\nrelated to a subset of the hydro-climatic ensemble that overestimates precipitation in20\nwinter and spring (Fig. 3). Especially the strong positive precipitation bias in May in\nmost RCM simulations leads to a distinct, plausible decrease of the peak flow through\nbias correction. Yet, unlike in the Saumon case the BC0 peak time is not shifted com-\npared to BC1, because temperature biases are generally small. Runoff in fall and winter\nis also overestimated by the BC0 ensemble, especially at the end of the year, which is25\nagain related to precipitation biases (Fig. 3). Of course BC1 does clearly improve the\nresults for Schlehdorf (Fig. 5), but a general overestimation of runoff remains. Thus,\nbias correction improves the situation significantly, but some artefacts seem to resist.\n10223\nHESSD\n9, 10205\u201310243, 2012\nOn the need for bias\ncorrection in regional\nclimate scenarios\nM.

Especially the extremely large variability of BC0 simulated runoff\npeaks in spring, which is caused by some apparent outliers, is strongly reduced in the\nBC1 case. But also in fall and winter, bias correction results in a much smaller envelope5\nand hence less variability between ensemble simulations, because both temperature\nand precipitation are corrected toward observed values. On average, fewer simula-\ntions overestimate runoff for Schlehdorf, because precipitation of the BC1 ensemble is\n100mm per year lower than in the BC0 ensemble.\nFigure 6 presents the relative error of simulated indicators compared to observed MF,10\nHF2 and 7LF2. One can notice that BC1 error values are in general smaller than BC0\nerrors. At Saumon, the combined MF uncertainty, related to natural variability of climate\nand the HyM ensemble, (expressed by the width of a box, which indicates the quartiles\nof the ensemble) seems to be similar (around 10%) for both cases. Yet, observing\nNash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (Fig. 5) and the median of the relative MF error, one15\ncan note a significant restoration of simulation accuracy through bias correction. For\n7LF2, bias correction does enhance the ensemble performance by clearly reducing\nboth the spread of results and the average error. Yet, the same conclusion cannot be\ntransposed to the relative HF2 error values. Although BC1 errors do not suffer from an\nunderestimation of high flows, the median and the spread of errors do not significantly20\nimprove when temperature and precipitation are corrected.\nAt gauge Schlehdorf, both the MF and 7LF2 indicator are greatly improved by bias\ncorrection. For both, BC1 results in a median closer to zero, less variability as ex-\npressed by the box plot and significantly less outliers as depicted by single data points.\nOf course this improvement is also reflected by the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency25\nplots in Fig. 5f, although two relatively low model efficiencies remain in the BC1 case.\nYet, regarding the relative deviation of simulated HF2 bias correction again does not\nimprove model performance that well. Both BC0 and BC1 box plots are quite simi-\nlar, which implies that both HyM structure and the intensity of singular events in RCM\n10224\nHESSD\n9, 10205\u201310243, 2012\nOn the need for bias\ncorrection in regional\nclimate scenarios\nM.

It reduces both the average and the maximum error of the simulated mean\nmonthly or daily discharge. Bias correction also has a positive effect on the overall syn-5\nchronism and seasonality of the hydrograph. Yet, its effect on the uncertainties within\nan ensemble is not clear, as those effects seem to be season, model and site specific.\nFurthermore, bias correction may affect different hydrological processes in a different\nway and as those processes are intertwined in HyMs, runoff is sometimes affected in\nunpredictable ways. Our results also show that it has little impact on high flow indica-10\ntors, while the simulation of low flows seems to be especially sensitive to the use of\nbias correction.\nEven if it ensures physical consistency between climate variables, the direct use of\nRCM output provides a disrupted representation of the hydrological regime for both\nQue\u00b4bec and Bavaria. The use of bias correction provides a more consistent repre-15\nsentation of the hydrological regime, yet the consistency between climate variables is\ndisrupted.\n3.2 What are the expected impacts of climate change and does bias correction\naffect indicator changes?\nFigure 7 presents the change in selected hydrological indicators between reference20\nand future period for the au Saumon catchment, with a distinction based on whether\nbias correction was used or not. Significant change signals can be seen in the date of\nspring flood (earlier) and low flow indicators (more severe in summer, less in winter).\nOverall mean flow tends towards a slight increase while the high flow indicators offer a\nlow signal to noise ratio.25\nThe impact of bias correction appears to be minimal for most indicators. The most\nobvious difference occurs with the date of spring flood for which the distribution of re-\nsults is shifted by 3 days. All hydrological simulations project an earlier spring flood,\n10225\nHESSD\n9, 10205\u201310243, 2012\nOn the need for bias\ncorrection in regional\nclimate scenarios\nM. J.

The lags range between 8 and 20 days. This could be the conse-\nquence of an increase in temperature and precipitation projected by the climate model\nfor winter (Fig. 4); therefore the snow melts faster and contributes to runoff discharge.\nHowever, the bias corrected simulations seem to project a shorter lag compared with\nthe BC0 simulations. Figure 8 shows the results for Schlehdorf. The ensemble tends5\ntowards a small decrease in overall mean flow and an earlier date of spring flood. The\nlow flow indicators present two interesting cases highlighting different ways bias cor-\nrection can impact the results. First, in summer, simulations using the CRCM project an\nincrease in L7F2 ranging from 20% to 90%. Bias correction modifies those projections\nto a range of \u221220% to 0. Since the CRCM simulation had the largest biases over this10\nregion, the role of bias correction on the ensemble appears to be one of outlier correc-\ntion in this case. Second, in winter, the simulations using the CRCM once again shift\nfrom a projected increase to a projected decrease of L7F2 with bias correction. How-\never, the importance of the ensemble is front and center here as the other two RCMs\nshow a wide range of positive and negative signals both with and without bias correc-15\ntion. Results for the high flow indicators give a pessimistic outlook on the possibility of\nreaching a conclusion given the large amount of uncertainty in the ensemble.\nAnother observation is that, in general, the range of the ensemble is either main-\ntained or reduced (sometimes significantly, as is the case with winter high flows), sug-\ngesting that bias correction has a damping effect on the climate change uncertainty.20\nAssuming that bias correction is valid, this is obvious as it is designed to bring the\nbiased simulations back to \u201creality\u201d.\nThe rank-sum Wilcoxon Test is used in order to compare the samples of climate\nchange signals. The null hypothesis (H0) is that two investigated data samples (BC0\nand BC1) have been drawn from the same distribution. In this study, the null hypothesis25\nis tested at four significant levels, from 5% to 35%.\nFigure 9 shows the results of this statistical test for Saumon and Schlehdorf respec-\ntively. In this figure, the blue square indicates no rejection of the null hypothesis, while\na number in the square shows the threshold at which the null hypothesis was rejected.\n10226\nHESSD\n9, 10205\u201310243, 2012\nOn the need for bias\ncorrection in regional\nclimate scenarios\nM.

In other words, it\nmeans that the bias correction has a significant impact in the climate change signal in\nhydrological indicators.\nFor Saumon, rejection of the null hypothesis is generally weak. The JDSF is the5\nonly indicator that is affected by bias correction for all members. When looking at all\nmembers together, the rejection is even stronger (this is an indication that the impact\nof bias correction on the change in JDSF of each member was in the same direction).\nSimilar results are observed for MF and Summer HF2. The winter 7LF2 shows the\nopposite behavior, where some individual members reject the null hypothesis more10\nstrongly than the ensemble (the impact of bias correction on individual members is not\nconsistent).\nFor Schlehdorf, the two most biased climate models (CRCM-CGCM and RCA-BCM)\nshow the most rejection. The effect of using an ensemble of multiple climate models\nis clearly shown in the results for all scenarios which have weak rejection. Actually,15\nwhile the null hypothesis for JDSF is usually rejected for individual models, there is no\nrejection at all on the ensemble.\nHence, while the climate change signals of outliers can be significantly modified\nby bias correction, it is recommended to present both, results with and without bias\ncorrection in situations where only a few climate simulations are used. When multiple20\nclimate simulations are available, the described results suggest that the general cli-\nmate change signal is less impacted and also supports the importance of ensemble\nprojections for robust change signal projections.\n4 Conclusions\nA modeling chain has been constructed in order to simulate present day and future25\nrunoff for the au Saumon (gauge Saumon) and Loisach (gauge Schlehdorf ) catch-\nments.

For this reason, bias correction of cli-\nmate model data is used in many projects; this added procedure contributes to the\noverall uncertainty. In fact, each component of such a hydro-climatic modeling chain\ncontributes to the overall uncertainty. There are choices to be made about which gen-\neral circulation models, regional climate models and hydrological models are used,5\nand whether natural variability is considered and/or bias correction is applied. Other\nsources of uncertainty that were not explicitly considered in this study include emis-\nsion scenarios, statistical downscaling methods and variations in hydrological model\ncalibration approaches.\nThe focus of this work is on the impact of the bias correction step on simulated runoff10\ncharacteristics and their climate change signals. At gauge Saumon, bias correction im-\npacts are evaluated compared to the uncertainties introduced by natural variability and\nhydrological models, while at gauge Schlehdorf the evaluation is based on an ensem-\nble of both climate and hydrological models. Although the uncertainties in (regional)\nclimate simulations are well known (Foley, 2010) and are considered in up-to-date in-15\nvestigations (Teutschbein et al., 2011), the uncertainty from hydrological models needs\nto be considered as well. Yet, it would be important to know, which level of model\ncomplexity is necessary so that a given hydrological model reacts plausibly to future\nchanges in climate, both in a qualitative and quantitative analysis. As this question is\ndifficult to answer, our model ensemble covers the typical range of model complex-20\nities used in climate change impact studies, thus the range of results produced by\nthese models shall give a good estimate of the uncertainty range regarding hydrologi-\ncal model complexity (Vela\u00b4zquez et al., 2012).\nAs expected, bias correction of climate simulations data (before using them in hy-\ndrological models) systematically provides a closer to reality representation of the ob-25\nserved hydrograph and therefore of both mean and low flow indicators. Yet, high flow\nindicators seem to be less affected, because simulation of high flows is mainly de-\ntermined by a hydrological model\u2019s structure and the simulated frequency of intense\nprecipitation events. When it comes to the climate change signal, bias correction can\n10228\nHESSD\n9, 10205\u201310243, 2012\nOn the need for bias\ncorrection in regional\nclimate scenarios\nM. J.

In particular, more strongly biased climate simulations are\nmore likely to have their climate change signal affected by bias correction, while the\naverage signal of a large ensemble is hardly affected. Yet, identifying outliers (biased\nsimulations) is nontrivial. Whether a single climate simulation is an outlier because of5\nclimate model inherent biases, and not a plausible climatic scenario, must be carefully\nevaluated. So based on our results and in this large ensembles context, two viewpoints\ncan be adopted:\n1. Bias correction can be seen as mostly unnecessary to obtain the climate change\nsignal.10\n2. Bias correction is safe to use in order to move into adaptation strategies, since it\ndoes not significantly alter the change signal.\nOur particular \u201clarge ensemble\u201d for the Loisach catchment reveals a large uncertainty\nin the climate change signal of certain hydrological indicators, notably of high and low\nflow indicators, meaning that much remains to be done in improving the modeling chain15\nto draw robust conclusions regarding those indicators.\nBased on our results, we assume that bias correction does not bring much added\nvalue information to the analysis of relative changes in hydrological indicators when\nconsidering other sources of uncertainty, mainly the choice of climate and hydrological\nmodels. However, this methodology should be validated upon a wider set of catchments20\n(spatial validation) and a larger set of climate simulations to improve the robustness of\nthis conclusion. Furthermore, we recommend the development of a bias correction\nmethod that aims at a fair trade-off between climate variables and hydrological regime\nconsistency.\nAcknowledgements.

Adebiyi* and Jasper F. Kok\nCoarse mineral dust (diameter, \u22655 \uf06dm) is an important component of the Earth system that affects clouds, ocean \necosystems, and climate. Despite their significance, climate models consistently underestimate the amount of \ncoarse dust in the atmosphere when compared to measurements. Here, we estimate the global load of coarse \ndust using a framework that leverages dozens of measurements of atmospheric dust size distributions. We find \nthat the atmosphere contains 17 Tg of coarse dust, which is four times more than current climate models simu-\nlate. Our findings indicate that models deposit coarse dust out of the atmosphere too quickly. Accounting for \nthis missing coarse dust adds a warming effect of 0.15 W\u00b7m\u22122 and increases the likelihood that dust net warms the \nclimate system. We conclude that to properly represent the impact of dust on the Earth system, climate models \nmust include an accurate treatment of coarse dust in the atmosphere.\nINTRODUCTION\nDesert dust is a key component of the Earth\u2019s climate system, accounting \nfor ~70% of the mass and ~25% of the shortwave (SW) radiation \nextinguished by aerosols in the atmosphere (1). The impacts of dust \non the Earth system, as a result of interactions with radiation, clouds, \nand biogeochemistry, are sensitive to the sizes of dust particles in \nthe atmosphere (2). Although climate models are the primary tool \nused to understand dust impacts on the Earth system (3), several \nlines of evidence indicate that these climate models consistently and \nsubstantially underestimate the amount of coarse dust (with diameter \nD\u00a0\u2265\u00a05 \uf06dm) in the atmosphere (4\u20136). This underestimation of coarse \ndust has been recognized since the 1970s with the detection of large \ndust particles over the Caribbean (7) that were difficult to account \nfor in models (8). Recent ship-based lidar observations of dust mass \nconcentration profiles over the North Atlantic Ocean found that \nmeasured coarse dust concentrations still exceed those simulated in \nseveral models for the same time period (4). In addition, several \naircraft-based in situ observations have found that the measured \ncoarse dust particles are usually larger than expected, regardless of the \ndistance from the dust source (5,\u00a09). Moreover, observations made over \nthe Pacific Ocean also showed that more coarse dust particles are \ntransported further east, away from the Asian desert, than captured \nby models (10). Overall, several campaign observations have now shown \nthat more coarse dust particles are present in the atmosphere than \nare accounted for in current global models (4\u20136), but exactly how much \ncoarse dust is missing globally in climate models remains unclear.\nCoarse dust is known to have distinct impacts on several Earth \nsystem processes (2). One such key impact of coarse dust is its effect \non biogeochemistry and carbon sequestration (11). Coarse dust \ndominates the deposited dust mass flux (12) and, thus, affects the \ndelivery of key micronutrients like iron to the ocean surface, which \nmay in turn influence the uptake of carbon dioxide into the deep \nocean (13). Another way coarse dust affects Earth system processes \nis through interactions with clouds and radiation (14). Coarse dust \nparticles are more effective cloud and ice condensation nuclei than \nfine dust particles (diameter D\u00a0<\u00a05 \uf06dm) and, thus, influence the \namount and spatial distribution of clouds, which in turn affect global \nprecipitation and climate (14,\u00a015). In addition, while fine dust \nparticles cool the climate by predominantly scattering SW radiation, \ncoarse dust particles warm the climate system by absorbing both \nSW and longwave (LW) radiation (16). This absorption of radiation \nby coarse dust can also affect atmospheric stability and circulation \n(17). Since the impact of dust depends on its size, the underestimation \nof coarse dust in global models hinders our ability to accurately \nestimate the various impacts of dust on the Earth system (2).\nTo address the systematic underestimation of coarse dust in \nclimate models (4,\u00a05), we develop an approach that determines how \nmuch coarse dust is in the atmosphere and how much of that coarse \ndust is missing from current climate models. Our approach uses a \nframework to constrain the global coarse dust loading by using \npublished measurements of atmospheric dust size distributions, \nobservational constraints on dust shape and global dust optical depth, \nand an ensemble of global model simulations. We find that the \natmosphere contains four times more coarse dust than is currently \nsimulated in models, which results in a substantial underestimation \nof the coarse dust impacts on the Earth system, including warming \nby coarse dust at the top of the atmosphere (TOA).\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nSize distribution of the missing coarse dust\nWe estimate the global size distribution of atmospheric coarse dust \nby combining an ensemble of global atmospheric model simulations \nwith a compilation of published in situ measurements of dust size \ndistributions (see Materials and Methods and fig. S1). We take the \ncompilation of previously published in situ measurements and \nthe ensemble of global model simulations from a recent study (18) \n[the model ensemble includes Goddard Institute for Space Studies \n(GISS), Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with \nChemistry (WRF-Chem), Community Earth System Model (CESM), \nGoddard Earth Observing System coupled with Chemistry (GEOS-\nChem), ARPEGE-Climate, and Integrated Massively Parallel Atmospheric \nChemical Transport (IMPACT); see Materials and Methods and sec-\ntion S2 for details]. We determine the globally representative size- \ndependent correction factor needed to bring the fractional contribution \nof coarse dust in each model simulations in optimal agreement with \nDepartment of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, University of California, Los Angeles, \nLos Angeles, CA 90095, USA.\n*Corresponding author.

We define our coarse dust as \ndust particles with a diameter between 5 and 20 \uf06dm because 5 \uf06dm rep-\nresents the diameter at which most models begin to underestimate the \ncoarse dust (16) and also because most models generally do not in-\ncorporate dust particles beyond 20 \uf06dm (2,\u00a019). Although dust particles \nlarger than 20 \uf06dm have recently been measured in the atmosphere (20), \nwe limit our estimate to 20 \uf06dm because measurements of dust with \nD\u00a0>\u00a020 \uf06dm are still scarce, and using them may result in a large un-\ncertainty for the global estimate of the coarse dust (2). Despite limit-\ning the coarse dust diameter to 20 \uf06dm, our result shows that coarse \ndust accounts for 58% [95% confidence interval (CI), 50 to 69%] of the \natmospheric dust mass, which is substantially more than the 19% (6 to \n31%) estimated by an ensemble of global model simulations (Fig.\u00a01A).\nTo determine how accurately our estimates compare with \nmeasurements, we use a separate methodology described in (18) to \nobtain the coarse dust fractions at the locations, heights, and seasons \nfor which over two dozen measurements of dust size distributions were \ntaken. On the basis of the constraints on global dust size distribution \n(Fig.\u00a01A), we find that our estimates of coarse dust size distributions \nare in excellent agreement with measurements at various locations, \nheights, and seasons (Figs.\u00a01B and 2). In contrast, global models \nsignificantly underestimate the fraction of coarse dust relative to \neach of these measurements. On average, this systematic model \nunderestimation of coarse dust ranges between half to one-and-a-\nhalf orders of magnitude and increases with dust diameter (Fig.\u00a01B \nand table S1). Although the model bias is significant for all locations \nconsidered here, most models perform better near dust-source regions \nthan farther downstream (Fig.\u00a02 and table S2). We also compare our \nestimates of the fraction of coarse dust in the atmosphere to recent \nestimates by Kok et al. (16). Whereas Kok et al. (16) obtained the \nglobal fraction of coarse dust by combining constraints on the emitted \ndust size distribution with model simulations of dust lifetime, our \napproach uses direct measurements of atmospheric dust size distribu-\ntion to constrain the global size distribution. Although the 43% (38 to \n49%) global fraction of atmospheric coarse dust estimated by Kok et al. \n(16) is higher than that simulated by global models, it is still sub-\nstantially lower than our estimates (Fig.\u00a01A). Furthermore, the spatio-\ntemporally collocated comparison with the compilation of measured \ndust size distributions indicates that, although the coarse dust estimates \nfrom Kok et al. (16) are in better agreement with measurements than \nmodel simulations (figs. S2 and S3), they still underestimate the coarse \ndust fraction in the atmosphere (Fig.\u00a01B). Overall, the fractional \ncontribution of coarse dust in the atmosphere per unit dust mass is \nhigher than what is simulated in models or estimated by constraining \nonly the emitted dust size distribution.\nAtmospheric mass load of the missing coarse dust\nWe combined our constrained global dust size distribution (Fig.\u00a01A) \nwith observational constraints on global dust aerosol optical depth \nand dust extinction efficiency to estimate the size-resolved global \natmospheric dust load\u2014that is, the total mass load of dust in the \natmosphere for each particle size (see Materials and Methods). We \nused constraints on the global dust aerosol optical depth from \nRidley et al. (21), which combined extensive satellite and ground-based \nobservations of aerosol optical depth with an ensemble of model \nsimulations that separated dust from nondust optical depth. We also \nused constraints on the size-resolved dust extinction efficiency from \nKok et al. (16), which leveraged observational and experimental con-\nstraints on dust shape and dust index of refraction. This study, thus, \naccounted for the effect of dust asphericity, which enhances dust \nextinction by ~30% in the SW (16). We compared our estimates of \nthe size-resolved atmospheric dust load with previously published \nresults from Kok et al. (16), and with an ensemble of AeroCom models \n[Aerosol Comparison between Observations and Models project\u2014\nGISS, Global Ozone Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport \n(GOCART), Community Atmosphere Model (CAM), Model for \nAtmospheric Transport and Chemistry (MATCH), Model for OZone \nAnd Related chemical Tracers (MOZART), IMPACT, Laboratoire \nd\u2019Optique Atmo-sph\u00e9rique (LOA); see Materials and Methods and \nsection S2 for details] representing the collective state of commonly \nused global atmospheric models (16,\u00a019). It is worth noting that the \nensemble of AeroCom models used for comparison is different \nfrom the ensemble of global models used to constrain the dust size \ndistributions (see table S3).\nd\nA B\nFig. 1. Constraints on the global coarse dust size distribution. (A) Constraint on the global dust size distribution obtained using measurements of atmospheric dust \nsize distributions (red/pink) indicates that the atmosphere contains substantially more coarse dust than obtained in a recent analysis (black/gray; (16)) and accounted for in \nan ensemble of global model simulations (colored lines). Each size distribution is normalized such that the integral of dV/dD equals one. (B) Size-resolved log-mean bias \nagainst measurements of dust size distribution (see also Fig. 2) indicates that our constraints on the coarse dust size distribution perform better than those obtained \nfrom Kok et al. (16) (black/gray) and an ensemble of global model simulations (blue/cyan; global models used are shown in Fig. 1A). The last column shows the overall \nlog-mean bias for all coarse dust between diameter 5 and 20 \uf06dm. The shading in (A) and the error bars in (B) represent the 95% confidence interval.\nAdebiyi and Kok, Sci. Adv. 2020; 6 : eaaz9507     8 April 2020\nS C I E N C E  A D V A N C E S  |  R E S E A R C H  A R T I C L E\n3 of 9\nWe find that current models miss most of the coarse dust load in \nthe atmosphere (Fig.\u00a03). That is, the atmosphere contains about 17 Tg \n(10 to 29 Tg) of coarse dust, whereas AeroCom models account \nfor only 4.0 Tg (3.5 to 6.0 Tg), thus missing about three-quarters of \nthe coarse dust load in the atmosphere. In addition to the missing \ncoarse dust, current models do not account for giant dust particles \nwith D\u00a0>\u00a020 \uf06dm, which can contribute substantially to mass loading \nclose to source regions (6). As a result, we consider our estimates of \nthe coarse dust load in the atmosphere to be lower bound (20), and \nthe underestimation of coarse dust in AeroCom models may, thus, \nbe even larger than we estimate here. Furthermore, a recent analysis of \nthe atmospheric dust load from Kok et al. (16) that used constraints of \nthe emitted dust size distribution also substantially underestimates \nthe coarse dust load, accounting for only 10 Tg (6 to 15 Tg) of the \ncoarse dust load. Because this recent analysis (16) and the AeroCom \nmodels miss most of the coarse dust, they also attribute the aerosol \noptical depth produced by coarse dust to fine dust instead, resulting in \nan overestimation of fine dust (Fig.\u00a03). Overall, the global atmosphere \ncontains about 40% more dust (fine and coarse) than what is simulated \nby AeroCom models, and that is about 80% of the total mass load of \nparticulate matters in the atmosphere (22).\nPossible reasons for why models miss most of the coarse dust\nThe systematic underestimation of atmospheric coarse dust suggests \nthat one or more important processes are inaccurately represented \nin global atmospheric models. Since the atmospheric dust size \ndistribution is primarily determined by the size distribution of dust \nat emission and size-dependent deposition processes (2,\u00a019), our \nresults suggest that models inadequately represent either the size \ndistribution at emission or deposition processes and possibly both \n(Fig.\u00a02). To improve size distribution at emission, most of the model \nsimulations in our ensemble used a coarser dust size distribution at \nemission (16), which is based on experimental constraints following \nbrittle fragmentation theory (23), than those used in AeroCom \nmodels (19). However, recent measurements taken over the Sahara \ndesert suggest that these global models still underestimate the coarse \ndust at emission (24). Moreover, several previously published \nmeasurements of emitted size distribution may have also underestimated \nthe coarse dust particles because of the losses of particles in the \ninstrument\u2019s inlet system (25). Even when the emitted dust size \ndistribution is constrained using measurements (16,\u00a023), the comparison \nof globally averaged dust size distributions in Figs.\u00a01 and 3 suggests \nthat coarse dust also deposits out of the atmosphere less quickly than \nFig. 2. Measurement compilation of coarse dust size distributions indicates that current global models substantially underestimate coarse dust fractions. \nWe compare each measurement [purple dots; compiled by (18)] against the corresponding seasonally averaged dust size distribution obtained from an ensemble of \nmodel simulations (blue lines) as well as from this study (red lines). All size distributions are normalized at 5-\uf06dm diameter to emphasize the discrepancies.\nAdebiyi and Kok, Sci. Adv. 2020; 6 : eaaz9507     8 April 2020\nS C I E N C E  A D V A N C E S  |  R E S E A R C H  A R T I C L E\n4 of 9\npredicted in models. This finding is supported by measurements \nthat found coarse dust particles are deposited at greater distances \nfrom dust-source regions than can be predicted by models or explained \nby current dust deposition theory (5,\u00a012). Our results further indicate \nthat dust deposits too quickly in models, because model biases are \nlarger relative to measurements taken farther from dust sources \nthan those taken closer to dust sources (see table S2). In addition, \nsatellite-based retrievals and ship-based measurements of dust optical \ndepth across the dust-dominated parts of the North Atlantic indicate \nthat the height of dust layers decreases more slowly away from dust \nsources than has been simulated by a range of climate models (4). \nAlthough inaccuracies in the emitted dust size distributions likely \ncontribute to the underestimation of coarse dust in models, a range \nof measurements indicates that the underestimation of atmospheric \ncoarse dust is also driven by too fast deposition of coarse dust in \nglobal models.\nSeveral possible reasons could contribute to global models depositing \ncoarse dust out of the atmosphere too quickly. First, models assume \ndust is spherical (26), which likely causes an overestimation of their \ngravitational settling speed. The rationale for this is that aspherical \ndust particles have a greater surface-to-volume ratio and, thus, a \nslower deposition velocity than spherical dust. Second, turbulent or \nconvective vertical mixing within an elevated dust layer such as the \nSahara Air Layer can work against gravitational settling, therefore \nincreasing the lifetime of the coarse dust in the atmosphere (27). \nThis convective mixing can be generated either by strong horizontal \nwinds that induce vertical wind shear and buoyancy around the \ntransporting dust (28) or by differential vertical radiative heating \nwithin the dust layer (29). Unlike at the TOA, dust particles can \nradiatively warm a dust layer in the SW and cool it in the LW (29). \nTherefore, more coarse dust in a dust layer can lead to a stronger \nLW cooling at the top and a stronger SW warming at the lower part, \ninducing a vertical mixing that can keep the dust layer elevated \nfarther from source regions than what global models predict. The \npotential for this vertical mixing is supported by observational \nevidence that includes the lack of variability with height in both the \nmeasured aerosol concentration (5,\u00a09) and the satellite-retrieved \ndepolarization ratio (30) within the dust layer, as well as vertically \nuniform radiosonde-derived potential temperature profiles retrieved \nwithin the dust layer (9) over the North Atlantic.\nA third reason for why models overestimate dust deposition could \nbe that charged dust particles in the atmosphere generate vertical \nelectrical forces that can potentially counteract gravitational settling \n(31). While some measurements have shown evidence of electrically \ncharged dust particles in the atmosphere (32), and even proposed it \nas a mechanism for coarse dust particles persisting for long distance \nover the Mediterranean region (33), it remains unclear whether \nthis mechanism could substantially contribute to the missing coarse \ndust in global models (27). Fourth, global models can also overestimate \ndust deposition because of excessive numerical diffusion due to the \ntype of advective scheme used for dust transport (4,\u00a026). For example, \n(26) showed that not accounting for second-order derivatives in the \nnumerical scheme could cause an overestimation of the dust deposition, \nresulting in an underestimation of the atmospheric dust load by a \nfactor of two. However, by increasing model resolutions, errors \nassociated with numerical diffusion can be reduced, although not \neliminated (34). Last, the uncertainty in the simulated vertical \ndistribution and the numerical representation of the number of \nbins used during dust transport may also contribute to the missing \ncoarse dust in global models (35,\u00a036). For example, if dust plumes in \nglobal models simulate a lower starting altitude than observed or \nuse too few bins or modes to transport the dust particles, it could \nresult in a faster deposition of coarse dust in the models (4,\u00a036). \nTogether, dust asphericity, convective mixing within the dust layer, \nlevitation of charged dust, and uncertainties in simulated dust \nvertical distribution and numerical representation may all contribute \nto the underestimation of coarse dust in global models.\nImplications of the missing coarse dust\nOur finding that most of the coarse dust particles are missing in \nglobal models indicates that these models underestimate the extent \nof various important impacts of coarse dust on the Earth system. \nFirst, global models underestimate the radiative impact coarse dust \nhas on the global climate because it underestimates the amount of \ncoarse dust in the atmosphere. Since coarse dust warms by absorbing \nboth SW and LW radiation (16), the underestimation of coarse dust by \nBA\nFig. 3. Constraints on the mass of dust in the atmosphere. (A) Size-resolved dust mass distribution (Tg) indicates that the mass of dust in the atmosphere (red/pink) is \nsignificantly more than those obtained from (16) (black/gray) or an ensemble of AeroCom models obtained from (19) (colored lines/cyan bars), and (B) shows the corre-\nsponding atmospheric dust load (Tg) integrated for the coarse dust (D = 5.0 to 20 \uf06dm), fine dust (D = 0.1 to 5.0 \uf06dm), and all dust (D = 0.1 to 20 \uf06dm). The shading in (A) and \nthe error bars in (B) represent the 95% confidence interval.\nAdebiyi and Kok, Sci. Adv. 2020; 6 : eaaz9507     8 April 2020\nS C I E N C E  A D V A N C E S  |  R E S E A R C H  A R T I C L E\n5 of 9\nboth climate models and the recent analysis of Kok et al. (16) indicate \nthat the net dust direct radiative effect (DRE) is more warming than has \nbeen previously estimated. To better understand the impact of the \nmissing coarse dust on the global climate, we obtain constraints on \nthe global dust DRE at the TOA. We do so by combining constraints \non the size-resolved global dust optical depth obtained using the \nconstraints on the atmospheric dust load (Fig.\u00a03) and modeling \nconstraints on the size-resolved dust radiative effect efficiency\u2014\nwhich is the simulated dust DRE at the TOA per unit dust aerosol \noptical depth (see Materials and Methods). We find that coarse dust \nproduces a TOA warming that is substantially larger than is simulated \nin current models and estimated from past analyses (Fig.\u00a04) (16). \nSpecifically, the TOA warming due to coarse dust is 0.20 W\u00b7m\u22122 \n(0.11 to 0.36 W\u00b7m\u22122), whereas the ensemble of AeroCom models \naccounts for only 0.04 W\u00b7m\u22122 (0.01 to 0.09 W\u00b7m\u22122). This larger \nTOA warming by coarse dust in our estimate is driven in large part by \nincreased extinction of LW radiation, although increased extinction of \nSW radiation also plays a role (see figs. S4 and S5). Similarly, since the \nglobal estimates from Kok et al. (16) use constraints that leverage \nonly the measurements of the emitted dust size distribution, a 7.0 Tg \n(1.8 to 14.9 Tg) underestimation of the coarse dust load results in a \n0.07 W\u00b7m\u22122 (0.00 to 0.20 W\u00b7m\u22122) underestimation of the coarse \ndust warming of the global climate. In contrast to the coarse dust \nwarming, our result indicates less TOA cooling by fine dust because \nthe increased extinction from coarse dust necessitates less extinction \nfrom fine dust to match satellite constraints on dust aerosol optical \ndepth (21). Therefore, accounting for coarse dust in the atmosphere \ncauses the net impact of dust at the TOA to be substantially less \ncooling than previously estimated, resulting in an increased likelihood \n(about 40%) that dust net warms the global climate (Fig.\u00a03).\nOur analysis of dust DRE is subject to some limitations that \naffect the estimated TOA warming by the missing coarse dust (see \nalso section S5). For instance, our estimate of dust DRE is limited by \nthe uncertainties in the simulated size-resolved dust radiative effect \nefficiencies (see Materials and Methods and section S5). In particular, \na recent study (37) suggests that the dust refractive index used in the \nmodel simulations of the radiative effect efficiency might overestimate \nthe imaginary part of the refractive index in the LW spectrum. \nAs such, our estimate of dust DRE may overestimate the coarse dust \nwarming in the LW. On the other hand, although we limit our analysis \nto dust with D\u00a0\u2264\u00a020 \uf06dm because of a dearth of both size distribution \nmeasurements and model simulations that extend to larger particle \nsizes (see Materials and Methods), giant dust particles with D\u00a0>\u00a020 \uf06dm \nhave been observed to contribute substantially to dust concentrations \nand LW extinction close to major source regions such as the Sahara \ndesert (20). As such, the underestimation of TOA coarse dust warming \nin AeroCom models may also be larger than we estimated here. Further \nmeasurement and modeling constraints on dust properties are, thus, \nneeded to better estimate the radiative effects of coarse and giant \ndust particles in the atmosphere.\nA second consequence of the coarse dust missing from global \nmodels is that the missing coarse dust can bias the simulations of \nglobal clouds and precipitation. Since the absorption of SW radiation \nby coarse dust warms the atmosphere (29), an underestimation of the \nwarming coarse dust within a cloud layer could cause an underestimation \nof cloud evaporation that can suppress precipitation (14). In addition, \nSW absorption may also result in enhanced precipitation through \nits impact on large-scale dynamics (38). In contrast, coarse dust is \nan important source of giant cloud condensation nuclei, the presence \nof which can accelerate the formation of precipitation by producing \nlarge cloud droplets (15,\u00a039). Therefore, the underestimation of \ncoarse dust by global models can substantially affect the amount \nand timing of precipitation.\nA third consequence of the coarse dust missing from global \nmodels is an underestimation of dust deposition into the ocean. \nSince more coarse dust particles are present in the atmosphere, it \nalso suggests that they have a longer lifetime than those simulated in \nglobal models. Whereas current global models simulate a substantial \namount of dry deposition over land and close to source regions (36), \na longer coarse dust lifetime increases coarse dust deposition farther \nA B\nFig. 4. Constraints on dust direct radiative effects at the top of the atmosphere (DRETOA W\u00b7m\u22122). Size-aggregated DRETOA indicates that accounting for the missing \ncoarse dust increases the coarse dust warming, resulting in an overall reduction in the global all-dust radiative cooling. The DRETOA (W\u00b7m\u22122) values are obtained in this study \n(red/pink), from Kok et al. (16) (black/gray), and an ensemble of AeroCom models (blue lines).

Therefore, accounting for \nthe missing coarse dust in global models will increase dust deposition \ninto the ocean, thus also increasing dust-induced productivity of \nocean ecosystems and the uptake of carbon dioxide into the deep \nocean (11,\u00a013).\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe have shown that climate models miss most of the coarse dust \n(D\u00a0\u2265\u00a05 \uf06dm) in the atmosphere, causing an underestimation of \nimportant impacts of coarse dust on ocean ecosystems, clouds, and \nglobal climate. We find that the mass of coarse dust in the atmosphere \nis about four times greater than simulated in current climate \nmodels, resulting in greater total dust mass load in the atmosphere. \nAlthough inaccuracies in the representation of dust emission might \ncontribute to this underestimation of coarse dust in models, our \nresults indicate that climate models also deposit coarse dust out \nof the atmosphere too quickly. Accounting for this missing coarse \ndust increases the TOA coarse dust warming by about 0.15 W\u00b7m\u22122 \n(0.10 to 0.24 W\u00b7m\u22122), increases the fertilization of ocean ecosystems \nby dust deposition, and affects the distribution of global clouds and \nprecipitation. Therefore, climate models must account for the missing \ncoarse dust to accurately simulate its impact on clouds, biogeochemistry, \nand global climate.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nTo estimate the amount of coarse dust particles in the atmosphere, \nwe developed a framework that combines an ensemble of model \nsimulations with a compilation of dozens of in situ dust size distributions. \nWe describe this framework below and use it to obtain constraints \non the globally averaged dust size distribution and the global load of \ncoarse dust. We also estimate the impact of this global load of coarse \ndust on the global dust DRE.\nConstraining the global dust size distribution\nWe constrained the global coarse dust size distribution by determining \nthe size-dependent globally representative correction factor needed \nto bring model simulations in optimal agreement with a compilation \nof measured atmospheric dust size distributions. Specifically, we \ndetermined the correction factor for each particle bin by minimizing \nthe sum of the squared deviations between the modeled and the \nmeasured coarse dust size distributions. That is\n  \u03c7 k 2(D) =  \u2211 \nj=1\n N o \n  { log [  \u03b4 atm k (D)\u22c5   d  V  \n\u2322\n f  \nk,j \n \u2500\ndD\n (D)  ] \u2212 log [   d  V  \n\u2322\n o  \nj  \u2500\ndD\n (D)  ] } \n2\n (1)\nFirst,  d  V  \n\u2322\n o  \nj  _dD is the j\nth measured dust size distribution, and No is the \ntotal number of available measurements. We give a summary of these \nmeasured atmospheric dust size distributions in the Supplementary \nMaterials (section S1), but details can be found elsewhere in (18) \nand the references therein. Second, the   d  V  \n\u2322 f  k,j  _dD is the modeled dust size \ndistribution that is obtained from the simulated dust mass fraction \nof model k. These models include the GISS ModelE atmospheric \ngeneral circulation model\u2014GISS, WRF-Chem, CESM, GEOS-\nChem, ARPEGE-Climat (from the Centre National de Recherches \nM\u00e9t\u00e9orologiques Earth system model), and IMPACT (see section S2). \nFurthermore, each  d  V  \n\u2322 \nf\n k,j  _\ndD\n  corresponds to the location, height, and \nseason of each jth measurement (fig. S1). Although each measurement \noften represents an average of several days or months, here we compare \nthem to the corresponding modeled seasonally averaged size distribution \n(Fig.\u00a02). Such a comparison is possible because the monthly or \nsubmonthly variability of the normalized modeled dust size distribution \nfor each season is often small (2). We also compared Eq. 1 in the \nlogarithmic space because the size distributions often span several \norders of magnitude (2). Last,  \uf064 atm k is the size-resolved correction \nfactor needed to bring each model simulation, k, in optimal agreement \nwith the compilation of measured dust size distributions. We use \nsix models to describe the state of dust size distributions in global \natmospheric model simulations (see the summary of the climate \nmodel simulations in section S2 and table S3).\nTo estimate the correction factor ( \uf064 atm k ), both the modeled and \nmeasured dust size distributions must be on the same equal footing \nconcerning the particle bin resolution\u2014that is, D in Eq. 1 must be \nthe same for both modeled and measured dust size distributions. \nTherefore, we define a common bin spacing spanning the diameter range \ncovered by each measurement, and we estimate the corresponding \nsize distribution that is mapped onto these new particle bins (see \ndetails of the procedure in section S3). That is,   d  V  \n\u2322 o  \nj  _\ndD\n  is the size distribu-\ntion that maps the jth measurements (Oj) to the new particle bins, \nand   d  V  \n\u2322 \nf\n k,j  _\ndD\n is the corresponding size distribution that maps the simu-\nlated dust mass fraction (f k, j) from model k to the new particle bins. \nThese common particle bins are defined by diameter Di, such that \ni = 1, \u2026, Nj, and Nj is the total number of bins for the diameter range \nof the jth measurement. We set the coarse dust diameters for Di \u2265 \n5 \uf06dm since this represents the diameter at which most models begin \nto underestimate the coarse dust (16). In addition, we limit the maxi-\nmum particle diameter to Dmax = 20 \uf06dm, following some recent \nstudies (16,\u00a018) and for a better comparison with global models, since \nmost models do not simulate particles larger than Dmax. Although \ndust particles with a diameter larger than 20 \uf06dm have been mea-\nsured in the atmosphere especially close to dust source regions \n(6,\u00a020,\u00a040), they are relatively limited and, therefore, constraints on \nthe global load of dust with Di > Dmax would be highly uncertain (2).\nWe next obtained constraints on the global coarse dust size \ndistribution in the atmosphere by solving Eq. 1 for the size-dependent \ncorrection factor that each model needs to minimize the deviation \nfrom the compilation of the in situ measurements. That is\n   dV atm \nk  \u2500dD ( D i )  \u2223 global =  d  V \n\u2322 f \nk \n \u2500dD ( D i )  \u2223 global \u22c5  \u03b4 atm k ( D i ) (2)\nwhere   dV atm \nk  _dD \u2223 global is the constraint on the global atmospheric dust size \ndistribution that corrects for the missing coarse dust for each model \nsimulation k, and  d  V \n\u2322 f \nk  _dD ( D i )  \u2223 global is the globally averaged dust size dis-\ntribution from model simulationk k. Similar to  d  V \n\u2322 f \nk,j\n  _dD , we also estimate \nthe sub-bin distributions of  d  V \n\u2322 f \nk  _dD ( D i )  \u2223 global for each model, mapping \nit to the common particle bin resolution with diameter Di (see \nsection S3.2).

To avoid this problem, we fit a generalized \ntheoretical function (see Eq. 6 in (18)) that describes the atmospheric \ndust size distribution to the resulting global dust size distribution.\nThe procedure above obtained constraints on the global coarse dust \nsize distribution by using measurement constraints of atmospheric \nsize distribution only for dust particles with D\u00a0\u2265\u00a05 \uf06dm (Eq. 2). However, \nknowledge of both coarse dust (Di \u2265 5\u00a0  \uf06dm) and fine dust (Di < 5\u00a0\uf06dm) \nare necessary to estimate the total dust atmospheric load and the dust \ndirect radiative impact. Therefore, we use the existing constraints on \nglobal fine dust size distribution from Kok et al. (16), which leveraged \nmeasurements of emitted size distributions with modeling and \nexperimental constraints on dust size distribution. We do so because \nthis global fine dust size distribution from Kok et al. (16) was used \nin Adebiyi et al. (18), and the corresponding estimates of dust size \ndistribution accurately reproduce the in situ measurements for fine \ndust particles between Di = 0.5 to 5 \uf06dm [see Fig.\u00a04\u00a0in (18)]. We, thus, \nobtained the complete dust size distribution for dust diameter Di \nbetween Dmin = 0.1 \uf06dm and Dmax = 20 \uf06dm by combining the fine \ndust size distribution from Kok et al. (16) with the above constraints \non the coarse dust size distribution (Eq. 2) (see Fig.\u00a01A).\nObtaining the atmospheric dust load and the direct dust \nradiative effect\nUsing the constrained globally averaged dust size distribution, we \nestimated the atmospheric dust load and the direct dust radiative \neffect that accounts for the missing coarse dust, following the \nmethodology described in Kok et al. (16). First, we estimated the size- \nresolved global atmospheric dust mass load (Matm) by combining con-\nstraints on the global dust size distribution   dV atm  _dD with constraints on dust aerosol optical depth (\uf074atm) and dust mass extinction efficiency \n(\uf065atm) at 550-nm wavelength\n   dM atm (D) \u2500dD =  A Earth \u22c5  \n \uf074 atm  \u2500 \uf065 atm  \u22c5  \n dV atm (D) \u2500dD (3)\nwhere AEarth is the area of Earth and   \ndV atm  _dD is obtained from Eq. 2 above. \nWe obtained \uf074atm from (21), which observationally constrained the \nglobal \uf074atm using satellite and ground-based measurements supple-\nmented with an ensemble of global model simulations, yielding \uf074atm = \n0.030 \u00b1 0.005. The dust mass extinction efficiency is calculated using \nthe constrained global dust size distribution (  dV atm  _dD ) from Eq. 2, the \ndensity of dust (\uf072d = 2.5 \u00b1 0.2 g cm\u22123), and the dust extinction effi-\nciency (Qext). Unlike the estimation of dust extinction efficiency in \nclimate models that use spherical assumption for dust shape, here \nwe obtained Qext from Kok et al. (16), which leveraged measurements \nof globally averaged dust index of refraction and accounts for dust \nasphericity based on observation of dust aspect ratio and height-to-\nwidth ratio. Using this constraint on Qext, we estimate \uf065atm as\n  \uf065 atm =  \u222b \n D min \n \n D max \n   dV atm (D) \u2500dD  \n3 \u2500 2  \uf072 d D  Q ext (D)dD (4)\nSecond, we use the constraint on the global atmospheric dust \nmass load (  dM atm  _dD  ; Eq. 3) and the dust extinction efficiency (Qext) to \nestimate the size-resolved global direct dust radiative effect RTOA\u00a0at \nthe TOA\u2014RTOA, following (16). That is\n  R TOA (D ) =  1 \u2500  A Earth  \u222b  D min \n \n D max \n  d \u03c4 d (D) \u2500dD  \u03a9 TOA (D ) dD (5)\nand\n  d \uf074 d (D) \u2500dD =  \n dM atm (D) \u2500dD    \n3 \u2500 2 \uf072 d D   Q ext (D) \nFrom the equation,  d \uf074 d  _dD  is the constraint on the size-resolved \nglobal dust aerosol optical depth, and \uf057TOA is the size-resolved \nglobally averaged all-sky TOA radiative effect efficiency\u2014which is \nthe dust radiative effect that a dust particle with diameter D produces \nper unit dust aerosol optical depth. Both RTOA and \uf057TOA are defined \nfor the SW and the LW spectra as RTOA = RTOA, SW + RTOA, LW and \n\uf057TOA = \uf057TOA, SW + \uf057TOA, LW. We obtained \uf057TOA values using four \nglobal model simulations from Kok et al. (16). These models in-\nclude GISS, WRF-Chem, CESM, and GEOS-Chem. Details of the \ndust optical properties, including the refractive indices, used in \nestimating \uf057TOAboth in the SW and LW can be found in Kok et al. (16) \n(see also section S2 and table S3).\nSince the particle bins of the model simulations are discretized, \nwe have to also discretize RTOA in Eq. 5, such that\n  R TOA ( D \uf067,i ) =  \u2211 \ni=1\n N \uf067 \n  \n \uf057 TOA \n\uf067\u202f ( D \uf067,i ) \u2500 A Earth   \u222b  D \uf067,i,\u2212 \n \n D \uf067,i,+ \n  d \uf074 d (D) \u2500dD dD (6)\nwhere D\uf067, i, \u2212 and D\uf067, i, + are, respectively, the lower and upper diameter \nlimits of particle bin i, with i\u00a0=\u00a01,\u2026,N\uf067, N\uf067 is the total number of bins \nfor each of the four global model simulation \uf067. It is worth noting here \nthat the climate model simulations \uf067 used to constrain RTOA in Eq. 6 \nare different from the model simulations k used to constrain the \nglobally averaged dust size distribution in Eq. 2 above (see section S2 \nand table S3). Last, the estimation of corresponding dust load and \nDRE for AeroCom models follows the description in Kok et al. (16) \nand summarized in section S4.\nQuantifying the uncertainties\nWe quantified the uncertainties in the globally averaged dust size \ndistribution (  dV atm  _dD ; Eq. 2), the size-resolved global dust load ( \n dM atm  _dD ; \nEq. 3), and the dust DRE (RTOA; Eq. 6) using a nonparametric \nprocedure based on the bootstrap method. To do so, we assumed \nthat the sets of input variables for each equation are independent \nand are defined by probability distributions. Therefore, using these \nprobability distributions, we can estimate the resulting probability \ndistribution of   dV atm  _dD ,  \n dM atm  _dD , and RTOA, by randomly sampling (with \nreplacement) each of the input variables for a large number of times \n(104). Sampling with replacement implies that the same realization \ncan be selected from the probability distribution multiple times or \nnot selected at all.\nAlthough our nonparametric procedure propagates the uncertainties \nin the observations and model simulations, our result is still affected by \nother limitations associated with the input parameters (see section S5). \nAs a result, our estimates of coarse dust can further be improved as \nmore measurements of dust size distribution, and accurate constraints \non other dust properties become available.\nSUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALS\nSupplementary material for this article is available at http://advances.sciencemag.org/cgi/\ncontent/full/6/15/eaaz9507/DC1\nAdebiyi and Kok, Sci.

Higher temperatures are likely\nto increase evapotranspiration and therefore the atmospheric water vapour content.\nThis may result in changes in large-scale precipitation patterns and the frequency of\nextreme events. The changes in evapotranspiration and the timing and intensity of25\n1822\nHESSD\n7, 1821\u20131848, 2010\nImplications for water\nresources\nmanagement\nW.

Understanding the implica-\ntions of climate change on these hydrological processes is of utmost importance for\nlong-term and sustainable water resources planning.\nThe output of General Circulation Models (GCMs) is usually combined with hydro-5\nlogical models to translate the changes in atmospheric diagnostics to variables that are\nof direct relevance for water resources management, such as streamflow in individual\ncatchments. However, the coupling of GCMs with hydrological models is challenging\nfor various reasons. A main problem is the difference in spatial scale between global\nclimate projections and water resources management. Due to limitations in the under-10\nstanding of local climate processes, data, and computing power, GCMs are typically\nrun on grid cells with a size of several 100 km. As such, they smooth out local gradients\nin precipitation and temperature. However, for many local hydrological processes these\ngradients are very important, and therefore further downscaling of climate projections\nis necessary.15\nThe need for downscaling is particularly urgent for mountainous regions. Mountain\nregions provide important environmental services, such as water supply for adjacent,\ndrier lowlands (Viviroli et al., 2010), but they are also are particularly fragile to environ-\nmental change. Many of the meteorological, hydrological and biological processes in\nmountain areas are characterised by strong spatial gradients that ban be easily per-20\nturbed.\nAt the same time, climate models predict a stronger effect of global warming in moun-\ntain regions compared to lowlands, due to a decreasing lapse rate (Still et al., 1999;\nBradley et al., 2006; Urrutia and Vuille, 2009). Many of them are also expected to ex-\nperience longer or stronger dry seasons (Beniston, 2003). The combination of a fragile25\necosystem and an amplified climate change illustrates the potentially dramatic effect of\nglobal change on mountain areas and their importance for society. In these regions,\nthe projections of GCMs are of limited value, and appropriate downscaling techniques\nshould be applied to provide climate change information needed to drive hydrological\n1823\nHESSD\n7, 1821\u20131848, 2010\nImplications for water\nresources\nmanagement\nW. Buytaert et al.\nTitle Page\nAbstract Introduction\nConclusions References\nTables Figures\nJ I\nJ I\nBack Close\nFull Screen / Esc\nPrinter-friendly Version\nInteractive Discussion\nmodels\nAlthough many methods for disaggregation of large scale climate projections have\nemerged in the scientific literature (for an overview see e.g., Maraun et al., 2010), very\nfew of these methods have been implemented in complex regions such as tropical\nmountain areas. The application of statistical downscaling methods is hindered by the5\nlack of long-term precipitation records needed to fit statistical models of precipitation\noccurrence and amount. Additionally, the density of rain gauges is generally low. In the\nEcuadorian Andes, for instance, the average density of rain gauges above 2500m alti-\ntude is around 1 per 220 km2. This is just above the recommended minimum densities\nof non-recording precipitation stations (250 km2 per raingauge, World Meteorological10\nOrganisation, 1995), but insufficient to capture local gradients (Buytaert et al., 2006b;\nCe\u00b4lleri et al., 2007). Additionally, the location of these rain gauges is strongly biased\ntowards the lower, more densely populated areas. In the upper Andean wet- and grass-\nlands which constitute the major water supply areas, rain gauge density is much lower.\nThe implementation of regional climate models (RCMs) constitutes an alternative to15\nstatistical downscaling methods. These models operate at a typical resolution of 50 km\nor lower, and can capture the spatiotemporal variability of climate in much greater de-\ntail than GCMs. By providing more realistic simulations of present and future climate\nchange in the Andes compared to coarser resolution GCMs, the RCMs can help provid-\ning better understanding of the impact these changes will have on Andean ecosystems20\nand streamflow. RCMs are based on the same model physics as the driving GCM\nand therefore do not require a dense observational network as it is needed for statis-\ntical downscaling. However, careful model validation with observational data is still a\nnecessary prerequisite to ensure that the RCMs accurately portray present-day spa-\ntiotemporal climate variability, in particular along mountain ranges such as the Andes,25\nwhere orography strongly affects seasonal distributions of precipitation. RCMs have\nbeen used successfully for climate change studies over South America (e.g., Marengo\net al., 2009; Soares and Marengo, 2009), but their application over the Andes is still in\nits early stages (Urrutia and Vuille, 2009). A major drawback of RCMs is that they are\n1824\nHESSD\n7, 1821\u20131848, 2010\nImplications for water\nresources\nmanagement\nW. Buytaert et al.\nTitle Page\nAbstract Introduction\nConclusions References\nTables Figures\nJ I\nJ I\nBack Close\nFull Screen / Esc\nPrinter-friendly Version\nInteractive Discussion\ncomputationally expensive and rather complex to implement. Therefore, they are typi-\ncally not run using the entire range of available AR4 models but simulations are based\non just one or two driving GCMs. This significantly complicates uncertainty assess-\nments. Model structural deficiencies, and errors in the forcing data and parameteriza-\ntion can also propagate from the driving GCM to the RCM and increase uncertainties.5\nThis makes it imperative to assess the value of RCMs for impact assessment on a case\nby case basis.\nThis paper aims at evaluating the usefulness of the regional climate model PRE-\nCIS and regional climate models in general for water resources management in the\nEcuadorian Andes. PRECIS was previously implemented for tropical South America10\nby Urrutia and Vuille (2009). Here we evaluate the control simulation carried out by\nPRECIS and compare its performance with the models included in the IPCC TAR and\nAR4 (IPCC, 2001, 2007). In a second part of the study, the GCM results are routed\nthrough a hydrological model to assess the uncertainty in future discharge predictions,\nand to evaluate the relative impact of the uncertainty of the climate projections com-15\npared to the hydrological model.\n2 Climate change in the tropical Andes\nThe concern regarding water resources in the Andes is reflective of the rapidly chang-\ning climate throughout the region. This is most notable in observations of near-surface\ntemperature, which show an increase of 0.7 \u25e6C over the past seven decades (1939\u201320\n2006, Vuille et al., 2008). Of the last 20 years only two (1996 and 1999) were below\nthe long term (1961\u201390) average. Analyses of changes in freezing level height (FLH)\nover the American Cordillera and the Andes, based on the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis\ndata show an increase of 73m between 1948 and 2000 and of 53m between 1958\nand 2000, a period for which the data are considered more reliable (Diaz et al., 2003).25\nThe notion that warming will be exacerbated at the highest elevations as suggested\nby GCM results is hard to verify due to the lack of long and reliable observational\n1825\nHESSD\n7, 1821\u20131848, 2010\nImplications for water\nresources\nmanagement\nW. Buytaert et al.\nTitle Page\nAbstract Introduction\nConclusions References\nTables Figures\nJ I\nJ I\nBack Close\nFull Screen / Esc\nPrinter-friendly Version\nInteractive Discussion\nrecords. However, recent reports from the Andes of Peru, which show that daily maxi-\nmum temperatures now rise well above the freezing temperature between October and\nMay even at elevations as high as 5680m certainly seem to support this assumption\n(Bradley et al., 2009). Such changes in temperature are sufficient to cause significant\nshifts in the ranges of native species and water availability.5\nChanges in precipitation over the 20th century have been less notable but Vuille et al.\n(2003) found a tendency for increased precipitation north of 11\u25e6 S, in Ecuador, while in\nsouthern Peru and along the Peru/Bolivia border most stations indicate a precipitation\ndecrease. These results were later confirmed by Haylock et al. (2006), who also found\na change toward wetter conditions in Ecuador and northern Peru, and a decrease in10\nsouthern Peru. Outgoing longwave radiation (OLR), which is indicative of convective\nactivity and precipitation, shows a significant decrease over the tropical Andes in aus-\ntral summer (Vuille et al., 2003, 2008). In the outer tropics (south of 10\u25e6 S) the trend\nis reversed, featuring an increase in OLR. While these trends are weak and largely\ninsignificant, they are consistent with projected changes in precipitation for the end of15\nthe 21st century by the IPCC AR4 model ensemble (Vera et al., 2006).\n3 Methods\n3.1 Study region\nThe PRECIS model is evaluated over the Ecuadorian Andes. In Ecuador, the Andes\nconsists of two parallel, north-south oriented mountain ranges, separated by the so-20\ncalled Interandean Valley. This valley is the economic backbone of the country. It hosts\nmajor cities such as the capital Quito (around 2 million inhabitants) in the north, and\nCuenca (around 500000 inhabitants) further south. Both mountain ranges reach an\naltitude of typically 4000m, with some peaks exceeding 6000m.\nThe climate in the Ecuadorian Andes is governed by various large-scale climate pro-25\ncesses (Vuille et al., 2000). In the south-west, the Pacific Humboldt current provides\n1826\nHESSD\n7, 1821\u20131848, 2010\nImplications for water\nresources\nmanagement\nW. Buytaert et al.\nTitle Page\nAbstract Introduction\nConclusions References\nTables Figures\nJ I\nJ I\nBack Close\nFull Screen / Esc\nPrinter-friendly Version\nInteractive Discussion\ncool and dry air masses, which lead to a semi-arid climate. Further north along the\nPacific coast, a tropical humid climate is induced by the warm and moist air masses\nadvected from the equatorial Pacific. The eastern slopes of the Andes are perennially\nwet under the influence of the Amazon basin. Finally, the interandean valley is typi-\ncally drier than the eastern side since most of the air masses have lost their humidity5\nduring the orographic uplift on the outer slopes of the Andes. Overall, precipitation pat-\nterns are highly variable, ranging from over 3000mm on the outer Amazonian slopes\nto less than 500mm in the interandean valley and the south-west Pacific slopes. On\ninterannual time scales precipitation and temperature variability is quite large and dom-\ninated primarily by tropical Pacific SST, with El Nin\u02dco events leading to warmer and drier10\nconditions in most of the Ecuadorian Andes, except for the SW part, while opposite\nconditions tend to prevail during periods of La Nin\u02dca (Vuille et al., 2000; Francou et al.,\n2004).\nThe study is conducted at two scales. The global and regional climate models are\nevaluated on a grid that covers Ecuador (75.2\u201381.1\u25e6 E, 1.5\u25e6N\u20135\u25e6 S). This scale allows15\nfor analysing the performance of the climate models over the three major climate re-\ngions: the Amazon basin, the Andes and the Pacific coast. The hydrological analysis\nfocuses on the Tomebamba river basin (1250 km2) in the south Ecuadorian Andes.\nThe Tomebamba is a subbasin of the Paute river basin (around 6500 km2, Fig. 1),\nwhich hosts the largest hydropower dam in the country (Daniel Palacios, 1075MW). A20\nsecond plant was recently opened (Mazar, February 2010). When fully functional, the\nsystem can supply up to a 50% of the country energy needs. Additionally, the Tome-\nbamba river is a major water supplier for the city of Cuenca. As a result, the catchment\nplays a key role in the socio-economic development of the region and there is an urgent\nneed for adequate climate change adaptation strategies.25\n1827\nHESSD\n7, 1821\u20131848, 2010\nImplications for water\nresources\nmanagement\nW.

This model is a limited-area,\nregional climate model, based on the third generation Hadley Centre RCM (HadRM3)\n(Jones et al., 2004). A number of studies have used this GCM-RCM configuration for\nregional 21st century climate change assessments over Central and South America\n(Garreaud and Falvey, 2009; Karmalkar et al., 2008; Marengo et al., 2009; Soares and10\nMarengo, 2009; Urrutia and Vuille, 2009).\nThe delta method (Fowler et al., 2007) was used to generate time series of future\nprecipitation for the hydrological modelling. In this method, differences between the\ncontrol and future GCM simulations are applied to historical observations by simple\nscaling. The delta method makes strong assumptions about the nature of the changes,15\nincluding a lack of change in variability and spatial patterns of climate. However, the\nlack of data and the high variability of the climate system in the region highly complicate\nthe use of more complex downscaling models.\nFuture potential evapotranspiration was recalculated after adapting the average monthly\ntemperature for future conditions. This method assumes that other variables affecting20\nthe potential evapotranspiration, particularly radiation and humidity, stay constant. Al-\nthough this is a strong assumption, there is currently insufficient data to incorporate\nsuch changes reliably in the calculations.\n3.2.2 Hydrological modelling\nThe Tomebamba basin has a complex hydrology. The upper part of the basin is covered25\nwith tropical alpine wetlands, covering metamorphic bedrock of low permeability. In the\n1828\nHESSD\n7, 1821\u20131848, 2010\nImplications for water\nresources\nmanagement\nW. Buytaert et al.\nTitle Page\nAbstract Introduction\nConclusions References\nTables Figures\nJ I\nJ I\nBack Close\nFull Screen / Esc\nPrinter-friendly Version\nInteractive Discussion\nlower parts of the catchment, quaternary deposits with high permeability give rise to\nground water aquifers that are thought to contribute significantly to the hydrological\nresponse. Although the major hydrological processes in the catchment are reasonably\nwell understood, very little quantitative information is available. Therefore, a detailed\nrepresentation of these processes in a hydrological model is impossible in view of5\nthe available data, and a parsimonious conceptual modelling approach was adopted\ninstead.\nThe tailor-made hydrological model was implemented, consisting of a loss module\nto calculate evapotranspiration losses, and a routing module representing the delay\nbetween precipitation and discharge (Beven, 2001). In the study region, actual evap-10\notranspiration may be significantly lower than potential evapotranspiration due to soil\nmoisture deficits. Both potential evapotranspiration and soil moisture are strongly de-\npendent on climatological conditions which may change in future scenarios. These\nchanges are accounted for by applying the catchment moisture deficit store of Croke\nand Jakeman (2004) as a loss module.15\nFor the routing module, two parallel linear stores, for respectively a quick and slow\nflow component, were implemented (Beven, 2001). More complex solutions were\ntested, including autoregression functions and multiple combinations of linear stores,\nbut these configurations did not improve the model performance, while adding addi-\ntional parameters. The final model has 4 parameters and needs 2 initialisation values.20\nPotential evapotranspiration was calculated by means of the FAO-Penman Monteith\nmethod (Allen et al., 1998), using data from four nearby meteorological stations. To\naccount for altitudinal gradients, the evapotranspiration data were interpolated using a\ndigital elevation map at 50m resolution. For the interpolation, the Thornthwaite relation\nbetween temperature and potential evapotranspiration was combined with a lapse rate25\nobtained from 24 local temperature stations (\u22120.54 \u25e6C 100m\u22121) (Timbe, 2004).\nAreal averages of precipitation were obtained from 13 rain gauges (Ce\u00b4lleri et al.,\n2007) using Thiessen interpolation. Some gaps in the rain gauge data were filled using\nextrapolation from nearby stations using linear regression. Finally, the model was run\n1829\nHESSD\n7, 1821\u20131848, 2010\nImplications for water\nresources\nmanagement\nW.

The remaining parameter sets\nwere used to calculate 100% prediction bounds for the flow duration curves and aver-\nage monthly discharge for the past and future periods.

Disagreement\nin the magnitude of the precipitation anomalies is often higher than 50% of annual\nrainfall, while temperature projections range from around 1.5 to 4.5 \u25e6C. In the plots of5\nthe projection ranges and model agreement (Fig. 2), the Andes do not stand out as\na region with a particularly high model uncertainty. However, in the twentieth century\nruns for precipitation (Fig. 2), the Andes region and its surroundings are clearly visible\nas a region with a higher variation in model simulations compared to the surrounding\nareas (Pacific Ocean and Amazon basin).10\nThe disagreement among the models in representing the local climate patterns over\nthe Andes may have several underlying causes, but it is likely that differences in res-\nolution are a major factor. Indeed, due to their coarse resolution several GCMs are\nunable to represent elevation gradients properly, thus neglecting locally important pro-\ncesses such as orographic precipitation and localised convective events. A detailed15\ncomparison of the parameterisation schemes of all GCMs would be necessary to un-\nderstand the mechanisms behind this divergence, which is beyond the scope of this\nstudy. However, the fact that GSMs disagree in the representation of current climate\nposes questions about the reliability of projected anomalies.\nAt local scale and taking into account other emission scenarios, the variability in20\nprojections increases dramatically. For the Tomebamba catchment, projections for the\n2070\u20132099 period range between a \u221225% and 45% change in precipitation, and a\ntemperature increase of 1.2 to 4.8 \u25e6C (Fig. 3). Rejecting or reducing the weight of\ncertain emission scenarios or models may be one option to reduce these climate en-\nvelopes, but such decisions are subjective and controversial (e.g., Allen and Ingram,25\n2002; Stainforth et al., 2007b). Alternatively, especially for mountainous regions, down-\nscaling can be explored as a potential pathway to reduce uncertainty.\n1831\nHESSD\n7, 1821\u20131848, 2010\nImplications for water\nresources\nmanagement\nW. Buytaert et al.\nTitle Page\nAbstract Introduction\nConclusions References\nTables Figures\nJ I\nJ I\nBack Close\nFull Screen / Esc\nPrinter-friendly Version\nInteractive Discussion\n4.2 The value of regional downscaling\nThis section evaluates the use of PRECIS to improve GCM projections over the Andes.\nSimulations are selected for the 1961\u20131990 control run, since they can be evaluated\nwith observational data. It should be noted that a better simulation during the control\nrun does not necessarily indicate a better simulation in future conditions (Stainforth5\net al., 2007a). We focus on the performance of PRECIS in downscaling precipitation,\nwhich is the most important variable for water resources management.\nThe improved resolution of PRECIS compared to HadAM3 results in a much more\ncomplex pattern of current and future precipitation fields (Fig. 4). However, a compar-\nison with the 10min. observed climatology of New et al. (2000) reveals that this does10\nnot necessarily result in improved simulations (Fig. 5).\nIn general (Fig. 5, upper left), PRECIS underestimates precipitation along the lower\nAmazonian slopes of the Andes, while precipitation is overestimated at the higher el-\nevations of the Amazonian side of the Andes, consistent with the model validation in\nUrrutia and Vuille (2009).15\nThe observed displacement between observed and modelled precipitation suggests\nthat PRECIS is incapable of fully capturing the extreme gradient in orographic precipi-\ntation that exists along the eastern slope of the Ecuadorian Andes. The overestimation\nof precipitation along the eastern Andean slope is a problem common to all RCMs\nand related to excessive orographic uplift due to strong easterly winds (e.g., da Rocha20\net al., 2009; Insel et al., 2010; Urrutia and Vuille, 2009). It should be kept in mind,\nhowever, that the gridded observational precipitation products such as the climatology\ndata have significant uncertainties arising from space-time gaps in the observational\nrecords, instrumentation and calibration problems, and sampling inadequacies. This\nproblem is more serious for mountainous regions where the station density is low and25\ninterpolation procedures introduce errors (New et al., 1999).\nEven if the higher resolution of RCMs may not be sufficient to provide correct lo-\ncalised predictions, a better representation of climate patterns may result in an improved\n1832\nHESSD\n7, 1821\u20131848, 2010\nImplications for water\nresources\nmanagement\nW.

However, the scale at which such aggregation pays off\nis strongly dependent on the local climate conditions. Figure 5 investigates in more\ndetail the impact of the scale of aggregation on the accuracy of climate projections for\nboth PRECIS and HadAM3p. The control run of PRECIS and HadAM3p are compared\nwith the observed climatology at three levels of aggregation: the climatology resolu-5\ntion (0.167\u25e6), the resolution of PRECIS (0.5\u25e6) and the resolution of HadAM3p (1.25 by\n1.875\u25e6) (Fig. 5).\nAt HadAM3p resolution (Fig. 5, right) reveals that PRECIS has some potential for\nimproving precipitation simulations slightly, particularly over the Amazon basin where\nHadAM3p consistently underestimates precipitation. A similar pattern is observed at10\nPRECIS resolution (Fig. 5, middle), although local gradients over the slopes of the An-\ndes play a more pronounced role. This is particularly the case over the Amazonian\nslope of central Ecuador, where PRECIS overshoots observed precipitation dramati-\ncally, thus locally yielding worse results than HadAM3p. Finally, at higher resolution\n(Fig. 5, left) the effect is even more pronounced. Both PRECIS and HadAM3p are un-15\nable to simulate orographic precipitation along both Andean slopes, with the Eastern\nslope of the central Ecuadorian Andes being particularly problematic. This is indeed a\nregion dominated by strong orographic precipitation.\nThe results show that resolving high-resolution precipitation gradients in climate\nmodels is difficult and potentially risky. Misalignments between simulated and the ob-20\nserved atmospheric processes may result in very poor performance of the regional\nclimate model in certain locations. Such errors are averaged out over larger regions,\nbut may be problematic for local impact assessment where the exact location of pre-\ncipitation is important.\n4.3 Implications for water resources management25\nThe previous section has shown that regional climate models can improve the repre-\nsentation of local precipitation patterns under certain conditions, potentially decreasing\nthe uncertainty of climate projections. It would be necessary to implement RCMs for\n1833\nHESSD\n7, 1821\u20131848, 2010\nImplications for water\nresources\nmanagement\nW.

This is the topic of ongoing research. However, the\npotential improvements are also conditional on the contribution of climate projections\nto the total uncertainty of the projected impact. This depends on the specific system\nunder consideration. Figure 6 shows the uncertainties in predicting the flow duration5\ncurve and seasonal variability of river discharge under future climate conditions using\nthe IPCC AR4 model ensemble for the Tomebamba basin. This analysis focuses on\nthe A1B scenario, to facilitate comparison with similar efforts elsewhere.\nThe largest share of the uncertainty in future projections (61.4% for the flow duration\ncurves and 71.0% for the seasonality) results indeed from the climate model ensemble,10\nhighlighting the importance of improved downscaling. The significant contribution of the\nhydrological model itself to the total uncertainty nevertheless highlights the need for\nan improved hydrological understanding of the studied system. Previous hydrological\nresearch in the area (see Buytaert et al., 2006a, for an overview) has shown that a\npoor knowledge of precipitation patterns, as well as the functioning of local wetlands15\nare major problems for adequate hydrological modelling.\nFinally, when the uncertainty of both the GCMs and hydrological models is taken into\naccount, the range of potential scenarios is very wide. The potential future conditions\nbracket the current conditions entirely. Hence, at this moment no decisive conclusions\ncan be drawn about the magnitude or the direction of change of the discharge regime20\nunder future climate conditions. The question remains whether such projections are\nuseful for water resources management. Water managers usually turn to scientists for\nupdates on the latest certainties. An important implication of these and similar results\n(e.g., Dessai and Hulme, 2007) is that it might be wiser to turn to scientists for up-\ndates on the range of uncertainties for climate change impact questions. The regional25\nclimate change projections do not provide reliable estimates of future precipitation pat-\nterns at a local scale, which are needed to optimise water management strategies.\nThey provide information about the range of uncertainties and if anything, the range\nof plausible precipitation scenarios only broadens when climate change impacts are\n1834\nHESSD\n7, 1821\u20131848, 2010\nImplications for water\nresources\nmanagement\nW. Buytaert et al.\nTitle Page\nAbstract Introduction\nConclusions References\nTables Figures\nJ I\nJ I\nBack Close\nFull Screen / Esc\nPrinter-friendly Version\nInteractive Discussion\ntaken into account. While additional research can probably reduce the range of plau-\nsible scenarios somewhat, important uncertainties are unlikely to be eliminated in the\nforeseeable future. Still, adaptation decisions need to be taken now.\nSo, when optimizing water management based on future precipitation projections\nthat are riddled with uncertainties, what is the relevance of these modelling efforts5\nfor sustainable water management? Developments in climate adaptation and water\nmanagement research present a number of different approaches to uncertainties and\ndecision making. Adaptive water management (Pahl-Wostl, 2007) starts from the ac-\nceptance of irreducible uncertainties about future (climatic) changes. Assuming future\nchanges and irreducible uncertainties about the direction and timing of these changes,10\nadaptive management approaches move away from a \u201cpredict-and-control\u201d paradigm,\ntowards a more adaptive approach, with continuous learning and flexibility as key aims.\nIn this sense, infrastructural investments with high sunk costs, irreversible decisions, or\nfixed management strategies prevent continuous learning and adjustment. A more ef-\nfective way of dealing with unpredictability is to avoid control by creating the capacity to15\nrespond effectively to changing and unknown conditions, through developing strategies\nthat are robust under the full range of possible future scenarios, through diversification\nof strategies or through strategies that can be flexibly applied when needed (Brugnach\net al., 2008). The call for robust strategies can be complemented with a focus on the\nkey vulnerabilities of the water system and the services it provides, rather than on the20\noptimal strategy (Dessai et al., 2009). Evidence on the range of plausible representa-\ntions of future climate then becomes highly instrumental for identifying and addressing\nthese vulnerabilities, in order to avoid that the water system would fail to provide the\ncritical minimum of services. A related approach is the development of \u201cno regret\u201d inter-\nventions, defined as strategies that yield benefits regardless of future trends in climate25\nscenarios (Heltberg et al., 2009). Given that climate is only one of the many uncer-\ntain processes that influence water resources management, \u201cno regret\u201d strategies will\nfavour measures that are beneficial for these other domains as well.\n1835\nHESSD\n7, 1821\u20131848, 2010\nImplications for water\nresources\nmanagement\nW. Buytaert et al.\nTitle Page\nAbstract Introduction\nConclusions References\nTables Figures\nJ I\nJ I\nBack Close\nFull Screen / Esc\nPrinter-friendly Version\nInteractive Discussion\nThese strategies are ideally the outcome of an integrated approach involving sci-\nentists, resource managers and stakeholders. In the Paute basin, such interactions\nhave been ongoing for a long time. Two key ecosystems, Andean forests and alpine\nwetlands, have been identified as excellent water providers due to their high water stor-\nage and regulation capacity. Adaptation efforts have therefore focused on an improved5\nmanagement and conservation of these ecosystems (Ce\u00b4lleri and Feyen, 2009). Simi-\nlarly, erosion control and restoration of degraded agricultural fields in the lower areas\nof the Paute basin intend to lower the agricultural pressure on water resource areas\n(Dercon et al., 2006).\n5 Conclusions10\nThis study is concerned with the usefulness of RCMs for downscaling global climate\nprojections for regional water management in the Ecuadorian Andes. Global circulation\nmodels are fairly consistent in projecting an increase in temperature (around 3 \u25e6C) and\nprecipitation (around 10%) over the Ecuadorian Andes. The uncertainty in the projec-\ntions, quantified by the ensemble projection range, is similar to the adjacent Amazon15\nand Pacific regions. However, the Andes stand out clearly as a region of high uncer-\ntainty during the twentieth century run (20C3M), casting doubt over the reliability of\nfuture projections.\nThe evaluation of the RCM PRECIS over the tropical Andes gave mixed results.\nCompared to HadAM3p, which provided the boundary conditions of the PRECIS im-20\nplementation, PRECIS is able to simulate total precipitation better over the Amazon\nbasin. However, large errors in the simulation of precipitation patterns appear over\nthe Andes when the model is compared to observational data. Locally, they can over-\nshoot the error in the coarse resolution HadAM3p model. The results show that at\nleast for some regions and scales of aggregation, regional climate models such as25\nPRECIS may be instrumental in improving the simulations of global climate models.\nHowever, the conditions for such improvement should be very carefully analysed. For\n1836\nHESSD\n7, 1821\u20131848, 2010\nImplications for water\nresources\nmanagement\nW.

For most other variables that are\nelevation dependant (e.g., temperature), the better vertical resolution of RCMs does,\nhowever, yield a significant improvement over GCMs (Urrutia and Vuille, 2009). Biases\nin precipitation projections at the regional scale are nonetheless problematic as this is5\nvery often the scale at which water management is implemented, especially in trop-\nical regions (e.g., small scale irrigation schemes). Also for many larger watersheds,\nproviding mean areal averages of precipitation (as in Fig. 5, right) is often insufficient.\nEspecially in hydrologically heterogeneous regions such as the Andes, the exact lo-\ncation of precipitation is very important. For instance, high altitudinal wetlands have a10\nvery different hydrological response than the degraded, steep slopes of the interandean\nvalley (e.g., Buytaert et al., 2006a)\nIt should be noted, however, that observed climatologies themselves are prone to\nlarge uncertainties. Also, this paper analysed only yearly means. The comparison\nof the representation of seasonality in PRECIS is the topic of further research. Nev-15\nertheless, our results suggest that the resolution at which PRECIS was implemented\n(50 km) is insufficient, and the application of higher resolution weather and climate\nmodels should be explored.\nThe question remains to which extent these results can be extrapolated to other re-\ngions. The Ecuadorian Andes is a region with extreme gradients in precipitation, and20\na surface water dominated hydrology with limited buffering capacity. Similar regions,\nsuch as the rest of the northern Andes and other tropical mountain regions, may experi-\nence similar problems. However, in glaciated or snowmelt dominated regions (including\nmuch of the outer tropical and subtropical Andes) with a long dry season the situation\ncan be quite different. Here, changes in temperature are more important as they drive25\nglacier and snowmelt. It is expected that during the dry season no large changes in\nprecipitation will occur and that temperature changes will be the most important driver\nof changes in water resources. This can only be realistically investigated with RCMs\ndue to the elevation dependence of projected temperature changes.\n1837\nHESSD\n7, 1821\u20131848, 2010\nImplications for water\nresources\nmanagement\nW. Buytaert et al.\nTitle Page\nAbstract Introduction\nConclusions References\nTables Figures\nJ I\nJ I\nBack Close\nFull Screen / Esc\nPrinter-friendly Version\nInteractive Discussion\nFinally, this study evaluated only one RCM driven by one GCM. Other combinations\nmay give very different results. In order to evaluate whether RCMs indeed decrease\nthe entire projection envelope of precipitation, it is necessary to implement RCMs for\nthe entire GCM ensemble. Such efforts are currently ongoing. However, at least for\nsome regions it may be that uncertainty will not reduce sufficiently in the near future5\nto translate climate projections into hydrological projections that are of direct relevance\nfor local water resources management. In such areas, adaptation strategies should\nfocus on decreasing the vulnerabilities and increasing the robustness of current supply\nsystems.\nAcknowledgements.

Introduction\nSurface soil moisture is a diagnostic of the impact of climate on land conditions and is crucial for hydrological\nmodeling, agricultural management, and \ufb02ood forecasting. It also plays a prominent role in climate variability\ndue to its control on the surface energy balance [Entekhabi et al., 1999]. Soil moisture affects both average\ntemperature and precipitation at climatological scales [Seneviratne et al., 2010; Koster et al., 2004] as well as\nthe occurrence of hydroclimatic extremes [Teuling et al., 2010; Miralles et al., 2014]. Simulations from climate\nand weather forecast models have demonstrated the impact of soil moisture on the atmosphere at different\nspatiotemporal scales [Koster et al., 2006; van den Hurk et al., 2012]. In addition, recent efforts have detected\nthe in\ufb02uence of soil moisture on climate variability by using satellite [Miralles et al., 2012; Mueller and\nSeneviratne, 2012; Taylor et al., 2012] and in situ observations [Hirschi et al., 2011; Tuttle and Salvucci, 2016].\nThese studies pointed to the need of representing soil moisture feedback adequately in climate models in\norder to reduce the uncertainty in their projections of future temperature and precipitation [Seneviratne\net al., 2010] and highlighted the misrepresentation of these interactions by current models [Taylor\net al., 2012].\nDuring the last decades, a wide range of global soil moisture data sets have been developed which can be\nused for the purpose of investigating the realism of soil moisture\u2013atmosphere interactions in climate models.\nThese data sets include land surface models driven by observations [Bolten et al., 2010; Albergel et al., 2012;\nMiralles et al., 2011], atmospheric reanalysis [Balsamo et al., 2012; Reichle et al., 2011], and satellite-based\nproducts [Owe et al., 2008; Bartalis et al., 2007; Kerr et al., 2012]. Here we diagnose the realism of the soil\nmoisture simulated by the climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5\n(CMIP5) by analyzing their soil moisture bimodality based on a new metric. We refer to soil moisture\nbimodality when the soil moisture data probability density function has the shape of a bimodal distribution,\nthat is a continuous probability distribution with two different modes that may appear as distinct peaks.\nAmong the processes that may trigger soil moisture bimodality, we can \ufb01nd the simple climatic seasonality,\nwith the two preferential soil moisture states centered around the mean values for the wet and dry seasons\n[Teuling et al., 2005]. We can also \ufb01nd ocean-atmospheric oscillations, such as El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation,\nacting at multiyear time scales [Poveda et al., 2001], and processes like the monsoons or high-latitude\nfreeze-thaw cycles causing bimodality at subseasonal scales [Douville et al., 2006]. In addition, experimental\nstudies have suggested that the interplay between the saturated and the unsaturated zone may also induce\nsoil moisture bimodality [Daly et al., 2009]. In the time scale range of several weeks, other less obvious\nprocesses can cause bimodality as well, including land-atmosphere feedback or the offset of the monsoon.\nVILASA ET AL.

The Authors.\nThis is an open access article under the\nterms of the Creative Commons\nAttribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs\nLicense, which permits use and distri-\nbution in any medium, provided the\noriginal work is properly cited, the use is\nnon-commercial and no modi\ufb01cations\nor adaptations are made.\nSome authors have hypothesized that soil moisture bimodality is linked to preferential dry/wet states in the\nsoil moisture caused by positive soil moisture-precipitation feedback [D\u2019Odorico et al., 2000; D\u2019Odorico and\nPorporato, 2004], although other studies have indicated that the combination of seasonality with the nonli-\nnearity of the soil moisture response to climate is enough to create this bimodal behavior [Teuling et al., 2005].\nA variety of land-atmospheric interactions (including both impacts of climate on soil moisture as well as feed-\nback from soil moisture on climate) can cause the soil moisture probability density function to present a\nbimodal distribution. This gives us the opportunity to jointly assess different properties of the spatiotemporal\nsoil moisture variability that should be correctly represented by climate models. Therefore, the spatiotem-\nporal assessment of soil moisture bimodality implies an alternative to more traditional evaluations and\nenables the evaluation of statistical properties of soil moisture that appear critical for land-atmospheric inter-\nactions. While our diagnostic may in principle be applied to any climatic or environmental variable, in the\npresent study it is used to evaluate the realism of the CMIP5 simulations of soil moisture by benchmarking\nthem against global satellite retrievals. In the following, we describe the derivation of the bimodality metric\n(sections 2 and 3) and analyze the discrepancies between models and observations with regard to soil\nmoisture bimodality (section 4).\n2. Data\nWe are interested in knowing the spatial distribution and persistence of soil moisture bimodality and explor-\ning the differences in its representation in global climate models (GCMs) and observational data sets.\nTherefore, our methodology requires consistent and long records of satellite andmodel outputs. We selected\nthe satellite-derived soil moisture data set based on the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer\u2013EOS\n(AMSR-E) sensor and an algorithm developed based on Owe et al. [2008]. The AMSR-E data set was chosen\ndue to its multiyear record (June 2002 to October 2011), single-sensor nature, and global coverage; these\nare necessary conditions to meet the previously stated requirements. This satellite soil moisture data set\nwas derived from low-frequency (C and X bands) brightness temperature observations and obtained by using\nthe Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) to convert these observations into soil moisture values for the\n\ufb01rst few centimeters of soil [Owe et al., 2008]. Data are available in a 0.25 \u00d7 0.25 grid, with near-global\ncoverage twice per day, corresponding with the satellite ascending and descending overpasses. A screening\nof unreliable observations was performed by removing the 15% of observations with higher errors, based on\nthe analytical error propagation model by Parinussa et al. [2011].\nWe also use the outputs from the CMIP5 experiment [see, e.g., Taylor et al., 2011], in particular those from its\nsister Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP), now fully integrated within CMIP [Gates, 1992]. The\nAMIP experiment has a simple design: atmospheric global circulation models are constrained by realistic sea\nsurface temperature and sea ice from 1979 to near present [Taylor et al., 2011]; thus, these boundary condi-\ntions are shared by all models included in this study. These con\ufb01guration choices enable researchers to focus\non the atmosphere and land parts of the climate system without the added complexity of ocean-atmosphere\nfeedback. From the AMIP set of simulations, we select models that provide daily soil moisture data. The\ncomplete list of models employed and additional information about them can be found in Table S1 in the\nsupporting information [Collins et al., 2011; Essery and Clark, 2003; Hirai et al., 2007; Mizuta et al., 2012;\nNoilhan and Mahfouf, 1996; Oleson et al., 2004; Quandt and Ramsey, 1978; Rosenzweig and Abramopoulos,\n1997; Schmidt et al., 2006; Takata et al., 2003; Verseghy, 2000; Voldoire et al., 2013; Volodin et al., 2010;\nVolodin and Lykosov, 1998; von Salzen et al., 2013;Watanabe et al., 2011;Wu et al., 2010; Yukimoto et al., 2012].\nThe model variable analyzed (named \u201cmrsos\u201d in the CMIP5 archives, short for \u201cMoisture in upper portion of\nsoil column\u201d) is the integral value over the uppermost 10 cm of the soil column of the mass of water in all\nphases in that layer. AMSR-E satellite soil moisture data are obtained from a layer of heterogeneous depth\ncomprising the \ufb01rst few centimeters. This could potentially lead to discrepancies between models and obser-\nvations, although given the time scale of our analysis, these differences in representative depth are here\nassumed not to play a critical role. All data sets used for our analysis are preprocessed in the same way in\norder to create consistent data samples: for each grid cell, we collect soil moisture data from a 2 month\nmoving window from every year. The periods used for this analysis are 2002\u20132011 for the AMSR-E observa-\ntions and 2000\u20132008/2009 for the CMIP5 climate models. Our statistical analysis is independently applied to\nthis sample of data points.\nJournal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres 10.1002/2016JD026099\nVILASA ET AL. GLOBAL SOIL MOISTURE BIMODALITY 4300\n3. Methodology\nTo validate and intercompare soil moisture data sets, standard metrics (such as correlation coef\ufb01cients,\nroot-mean square-errors, and bias) and more elaborate methods [see, e.g., Crow and Van Den Berg,\n2010; Scipal et al., 2008] have been applied in the past. These metrics may be used to investigate the quality\nof soil moisture simulations in GCMs; however, they do not necessarily yield information on the properties of\nsoil moisture that truly determine its interplay with the atmosphere. Evaluating the spatiotemporal varia-\nbility of soil moisture bimodality implies therefore an alternative to more traditional metrics and enables\nthe assessment of statistical properties of the soil moisture that appear critical for land-atmospheric studies\nand that should also be captured by current climate models. Our statistical framework to detect bimodality\nis illustrated in Figure 1 and could be summarized as follows: (1) gathering of the data for the selected\ntime period (section 2), (2) calculation of the likelihood of a Gaussian distribution and the \ufb01t and likelihood\nof a two-mode Gaussian mixture model (GMM) (section 3.1), and (3) determination of the bimodality at\neach grid cell (section 3.2). In the following subsections, we present a detailed explanation of these\nmain steps.\n3.1. Data Fit\nOur framework assumes that the probability density function (PDF) of a soil moisture time series can be\ndescribed either by one Gaussian distribution (i.e., unimodal) or by a two-mode (i.e., bimodal) GMM.\nTherefore, the presence of unimodal or bimodal distributions in the soil moisture PDF is tested by \ufb01tting\nthe data to both a simple Gaussian distribution and a GMM. A GMM is a parametric PDF model constructed\nfrom a weighted sum of individual Gaussian PDF components. The probability distributions of continuous\nmeasurements are commonly parameterized as GMMs. In our particular case, we use a GMM composed by\ntwo densities, whose weights, means, and standard deviations are the parameters adjusted by using the\nexpectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, and we use the likelihood function to determine and quantify\nthe goodness of each \ufb01t.\nWe perform the analysis for the AMSR-E and CMIP5 global data set grids on a pixel-by-pixel basis; i.e.,\neach grid cell is treated independently. For each grid cell, we collect soil moisture data for a selected\n2 month time window from every year available in the data sets. Our statistical analysis is applied to this\nsample of data points. Sensitivity tests are performed to make a balanced choice for the length of the\ntime window. The 2 month window has been chosen for being the minimum time window size one\ncan choose with the length of the selected data sets in order to have enough data points to derive a\nreliable histogram.\nThe core of our analysis is the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. It is assumed that the probability\ndensity function (PDF) of a soil moisture sample can be described either by one Gaussian distribution (i.e.,\nunimodal) or by a two-mode (i.e., bimodal) Gaussian mixture model (GMM). Therefore, the presence of unim-\nodal or bimodal distributions in the soil moisture PDF is tested by \ufb01tting the data to a Gaussian distribution\nand a GMM with EM algorithm. The results of the test are \ufb01ltered by dependent and independent additional\ntests of bimodality based on the relations between the GMM parameters; these tests act as\nunimodal/bimodal masks and allow us to de\ufb01ne bimodality areas. Once the analysis is \ufb01nished for each grid\npoint, we can build global maps showing the analysis\u2019 results, wherein the grouping of points shows bimod-\nality areas of interest.\n3.1.1. Gaussian Mixture Models\nA GMM is a parametric PDFmodel constructed from a weighted sum of individual Gaussian PDF components.\nThe probability distributions of continuous measurements are commonly parameterized as GMMs. We use a\nGMM as the base PDF, and we \ufb01nd the values of its parameters that \ufb01t best to our data samples. The general\nformulation for a GMM is as follows:\nP xj\u03bb\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc \u2211M\ni\u00bc1\n\u03c9ig xj\u03bcj;\u03a3 j\n\u0001 \u0003\n(1)\nwhere x is a vector of continuous random data(sample), \u03c9i,i = j,...,K, are the mixture weights, and g(x|\u03bcj, \u03a3j),\nj = 1,...,K, are the component Gaussian densities, being K the number of modes. Each component density is\na Gaussian function of the form\nJournal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres 10.1002/2016JD026099\nVILASA ET AL.

The\nmixture weights satisfy the following constraint:\nXK\ni\u00bcj\n\u03c9j \u00bc 1 (3)\nThe complete set of parameters for a particular GMM includes the mean vectors, covariance matrices, and\nmixture weights for each of its component densities. In our particular case, we use a GMM composed by\ntwo component densities; the remaining parameters, components weight, mean vector, and covariance\nmatrices are adjusted during our analysis. Since our object of study, soil moisture, is a scalar variable, mean\nvectors and covariance matrices will be reduced to single-scalar values.\n3.1.2. Log Likelihood\nThe likelihood function is a function of the parameters of a statistical model, in the case of a GMM \ufb01tted to a\nsample, and is equal to the probability of the observed data given the particular parameters of the GMM. Here\nwe try to \ufb01nd the GMM parameters that maximize the likelihood function.\nThe likelihood function for a GMMwith a set of parameters (\u03bb), being x is a vector of continuous random data\n(sample), can be expressed as follows:\nL \u03bbjx\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc P xj\u03bb\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc \u220fN\ni\u00bc1\nP xij\u03bb\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc \u220f\nN\ni\u00bc1\nXK\nj\u00bc1\nP xij\u03c9j; gj\n\u0001 \u0003\nP \u03c9j\n\u0005 \u0006\n(4)\nA derivation from the likelihood function is the log likelihood function. The natural logarithm is a monotoni-\ncally increasing function, whichmakes both likelihood and log likelihood expressions equivalent for our goals,\nand since the resulting expression is more convenient for encoding, we can take the log likelihood (l) as\nl \u03bbjx\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc logL \u03bbjx\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc\nXN\ni\u00bc1\nP xij\u03bb\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc\nXN\ni\u00bc1\nXK\nj\u00bc1\nP xij\u03c9j; gj\n\u0001 \u0003\nP \u03c9j\n\u0005 \u0006\n(5)\nwhere\u03c9k are the weights associated to each of the GMMmodes and gk are the probability density function of\neach one of the individual modes.\nFigure 1.

GLOBAL SOIL MOISTURE BIMODALITY 4302\n3.1.3. Expectation-Maximization Algorithm\nThe expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is an iterative method that attempts to \ufb01nd the maximum like-\nlihood estimator of a set of parameters from a parametric probability distribution [Gupta and Chen, 2010].\nThe key elements in the formulation of the EM algorithm are (1) a description of the phenomenon (complete\ndata), which we assume can bemodeled as a continuous random vector Y with a parametric PDF P(y|\u03bb), where\n\u03bb \u2208\u03a9 for some set \u03a9, and (2) a measure or realization of this phenomenon, our observed data X, with a para-\nmetric PDF P(x|\u03bb). In our case, for a GMM, the X vector is composed by our data and the complete data Y is the\ncomposition of our data plus the information about to which of the modes pertain each of the data points.\nThe objective of the process is to \ufb01nd the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of the set of parameters \u03bb,\nwhich can be done easily in simple cases by calculating the \u03bb that maximizes P(x|\u03bb): \u03bbMLE = argmax[\u03bb P(x|\u03bb)],\n\u03bb \u2208 \u03a9. For more complex P(x|\u03bb), the use of alternative methods, like the EM algorithm, is advised [Gupta\nand Chen, 2010]. As previously stated, since the logarithm is a monotonically increasing function, the expres-\nsions of the likelihood and log likelihood are equivalent for maximization purposes, which allows us to use\nthe more convenient log likelihood expression in our calculations.\nThe EM makes a guess about the complete data Y and then \ufb01nds a solution for the \u03bb that maximizes the\nexpected log likelihood of Y. Once we have an estimation of the set of parameters \u03bb, we can make a better\nguess about the complete data and start iterating from there.\nEM is usually described as two-step process: The expectation step (E step) and themaximization step (M step).\nBased on Gupta and Chen [2010], we can describe the EM algorithm in the following steps:\n1. Initialization: Let m = 0 (\ufb01rst step) and make an initial estimate for \u03bb, for our particular case: two modes\n(k = 2) in a one-dimensional space, \u03bb(0) = \u03c9j0, \u03bcj0, \u03c3j0, j = 1, 2.\n2. E step: Given the observed data y and pretending for the moment that your current guess \u03bb(m) is correct,\nformulate the conditional probability distribution P(y|x,\u03bb(m)) for the complete data y. Using the condi-\ntional probability distribution P(y|x,\u03bb(m)) form the conditional expected log likelihood, which is called\nthe Q function:\nQ \u03bbj\u03bb m\u00f0 \u00de\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc Y x\u00f0 \u00de\u222bY x\u00f0 \u00de logP yj\u03bb\u00f0 \u00deP yjx; \u03bb m\u00f0 \u00de\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc EY\u2223x;\u03bb m\u00f0 \u00de logP Yj\u03bb\u00f0 \u00de\u00bd \u0003 (6)\nwhere the integral is over the set Y (x), which is the closure of the set y P(y|x,\u03bb) > 0, and we assume that Y\n(x) does not depend on \u03bb. The construction of the Q function is the key point of this step. Note that \u03bb is a\nfree variable in the expression of the Q function, so the Q function is a function of \u03bb but also depends on\nyour current guess \u03bb(m) implicitly through the P(y|x,\u03bb(m)) function calculated in this step. In our case the Q\nfunction has the following shape:\nQ \u03bbj\u03bb m\u00f0 \u00de\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc\nXN\ni\u00bc1\nXK\nj\u00bc1\n\u03b3mij log\u03c9j \u0002 log\u03c3j \u0002\nxi \u0002 \u03bcj\n2\u03c32\n\u0001 \u0003\n(7)\nbeing \u03b3ij the estimate at the mth iteration of the probability that the ith sample was generated by the jth\nGaussian component:\n\u03b3mij \u00bc\n\u03c9mj g xij\u03bcj; \u03c3j\n\u0001 \u0003\n\u03c9m1 g xij\u03bc1; \u03c31\u00f0 \u00de \u00fe \u03c9m2 g xij\u03bc2; \u03c32\u00f0 \u00de\n(8)\nAlthough since our only interest in construction of the Q function is in its maximization and the posterior\nconstruction of a new estimate in the M step, following the work of Gupta and Chen [2010], in this step we\nonly need to calculate the parts of the Q function that depend on \u03bb, the \u03b3ij estimate, and the membership\nweight of the jth Gaussian, which will also be used in the next step and can be de\ufb01ned as\nnmj \u00bc\nXN\ni\u00bc1\n\u03b3mij (9)\n3.

Convergence check: If the convergence check is not met, letm =m + 1 and go back to E step. There is no\nconvergence check speci\ufb01ed in the formulation of the EM algorithm; the standard stopping criteria is to\niterate until the estimate (\u03bb) or the log likelihood l(\u03bb) = log P(x|\u03bb) stops changing; in our case, we choose to\nmonitor the log likelihood evolution:\n\u03f5 > l m\u00fe 1\u00f0 \u00de \u0002 l m\u00f0 \u00dej j > 0 (13)\nbeing \u03f5 a constant greater than 0.\nThe EM estimate evolves from the starting point and is guaranteed to never worsen. If the likelihood function\nP(x|\u03bb) has more than two peaks (statistical aberration or any kind of systemic error can generate an additional\npeak), there is the risk for the EM algorithm not \ufb01nding the global maximum, and stopping at a relative\nmaximum, therefore incorrectly detecting the potential modes. This risk can be greatly reduced with a careful\nselection of the analysis\u2019 starting point [Gupta and Chen, 2010].\nAs the proposed GMM has always more adjustable parameters, it will always \ufb01t better than the single\nGaussian distribution. For this reason, we have to develop a method to quantify the relative improvement\nof the \ufb01t. In the absence of a de\ufb01nitive indicator, we designed a sorting strategy based on several different\napproximate measures and necessary conditions for bimodality. We will later use these indicators as masks\nto achieve our de\ufb01nitive results.\n3.2. Bimodality Check\nThe \ufb01rst goal after our analysis is the de\ufb01nition of high bimodality areas. In order to do so, we could think of\nusing the difference between the log likelihood of the single-mode and the two-mode models, but this is\nimpractical for several reasons related to the limitations of our analysis. Wemade the assumption that the soil\nmoisture is a Gaussian process, and as such, its character should appear in the probability density of our data\nof study. Several circumstances can concur, limiting the progress of our analytical techniques, for example,\nsoil moisture not showing a Gaussian nature, noise, and limited data availability.\nIn order to compensate for these limitations, and in order to be able to advance toward our goals, we use\nseveral additional tests of bimodality based on the relations between the GMM parameters; these tests\nact as unimodal/bimodal masks and allow us to de\ufb01ne bimodality areas. Some of them are derived from\nour a priori knowledge of the subject of study; some others are purely mathematical tests. These discri-\nmination mechanisms\u2014in conjunction with the original log likelihood result\u2014allow us to create bimod-\nality maps. We will thus set a threshold of minimum ratio between modes\u2019 standard deviations and a\nminimum ratio between modes\u2019 weights. Previous literature also gives a minimum threshold for\nAshman\u2019s D statistic, which establishes a weighted minimum difference between modes means. This is\nalso applied.\n3.2.1. Sigma Ratio Constraint\nGMMs are widely employed statistical tools, having thus a long history of use and study of their caveats. In\nparticular, a relatively small concentration of data points around a value, due noise or instrumental error,\ncan lure the \ufb01tting tool of use\u2014in our case, the EM algorithm\u2014in wrongly identifying said value as a mode.\nIn the past, this possibility disabled the use of maximum likelihood methods in case of heteroscedastic splits,\nexcluding all the mixtures in which different modes possess different deviation. The minimum-ratio\nconstraint removes cases af\ufb02icted by this behavior and enables the use of maximum likelihood estimators\n[Hathaway, 1985].\nJournal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres 10.1002/2016JD026099\nVILASA ET AL. GLOBAL SOIL MOISTURE BIMODALITY 4304\nAs far back as in Day [1969], the use of maximum likelihood is recommended when it is known that the\nvariances for the component densities are equal. However, Hathaway [1985] argues that the most important\ndetail is not the equality of component variances, but the knowledge of their relative sizes, so that appropri-\nate constraints of the form \u03c3i = Cij\u03c3j can be added, as shown by Quandt and Ramsey [1978].\nAs proposed by Hathaway [1985], we can use a \ufb01lter based in a minimum threshold value for the ratio\nbetween the value of the standard deviation of the two modes. Exact knowledge is not required; instead,\nimprecise knowledge usually available can be imposed by using the set of linear inequality constraints\n\u03c3i \u2265 \u03c3j/Cij, which can be written as\nmin\ni;j\n\u03c3i\n\u03c3j\n\u2265 C \u2265 0 (14)\nFor reasonable choices of C, the constraints rule out the spurious local maximizers corresponding to the\ngreatly differing standard deviations between the component densities [Day, 1969]. The value recommended\nin literature and used for this article is C = 0.25.\n3.2.2. Weight Ratio Constraint\nAs argued in the case of the Sigma Ratio constraint, we can use our a priori knowledge of the studied\nphenomena in order to develop an additional constraint. Considering a reasonable assumption that a\nminimum percentage of the total data should be in each of the modes of a bimodal distribution, we can\nde\ufb01ne an additional constraint, similar in formulation to the sigma ratio constraint:\nmin\ni;j\n\u03c9i\n\u03c9j\n\u2265 C \u2265 0 (15)\nIn this case we consider that a reasonable value for C should be 0.1, meaning that each mode should contain\nat least 10% of the total sample points. This weight ratio constraint shares the same goal as the previous\nconstraint; therefore, it is also a tool to avoid false mode identi\ufb01cation. Even though this tool has the same\nstructure and goal as the previously presented\u2014thus causing certain overlap in their function\u2014the general\neffectiveness of the classifying mechanism is nevertheless improved.\n3.2.3. Ashman\u2019s D\nAshman et al. [1994] conducted sensitivity tests of the kernel mixture model-based maximum likelihood esti-\nmator and developed an additional independent test on bimodality. They de\ufb01ned a dimensionless separa-\ntion of the means, originally tested for homoscedastic mixtures (i.e., when all modes have the same\nstandard deviation), yet that can be reformulated for heteroscedastic mixtures (i.e., when modes have differ-\nent standard deviations):\nD \u00bc \u03bc1 \u0002 \u03bc2j j\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\ufb03\n\u03c321\u00fe\u03c322\n2\n\u0001 \u0003r (16)\nFrom the analytical results of Ashman et al. [1994] and Everitt and Hand [1981], concerning the detectability of\nbimodality, one of the simplest and most useful features is that such a distribution only shows two peaks if\nD > 2. If the GMM-EA method detects two modes but they are not separated enough (D < 2), then such a\nsplit is not meaningful. Therefore, here we consider adequate to use this alternative formulation as an\nadditional test on bimodality.\n3.3. Summary\nAfter describing the log likelihood, EM algorithm, and the bimodality masks, our metric can be summarized as\nfollows. First, after applying the masking criteria we obtain a binary classi\ufb01cation: each grid cell is considered\neither potentially bimodal or not bimodal; counting the number of cells in each category leads to the results\nshowed in Figure 3. Second, we display the difference between the log likelihood of the EM-adjusted GMM\nminus the log likelihood of the single Gaussian \ufb01t:\n\u0394l \u03bbjx\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc logLGMM \u03bbjx\u00f0 \u00de \u0002 logLGauss \u03bbjx\u00f0 \u00de (17)\nThis quantity, i.e., the difference between the log likelihood of the GMM and the log likelihood of the single\nGaussian \ufb01t, when plotted as has been done in Figure 2, can give us an idea of how extreme or clear this\nbimodal behavior is, with lower values indicating either a behavior not clearly bimodal or simply not \ufb01tted\nJournal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres 10.1002/2016JD026099\nVILASA ET AL. GLOBAL SOIL MOISTURE BIMODALITY 4305\nto our assumptions and bigger values indicating a clear bimodal behavior. This method, in contrast with\nother possible but potentially more simple approaches, provides information about the physical properties\nof the modes which offer an insight to the surface conditions and climate characteristics in each area.\n4. Results and Discussion\nAreas of soil moisture bimodality for different seasons are illustrated in Figure 2, based on AMSR-E observa-\ntions. The four AMSR-E timestamps are from weeks number 11, 24, 37, and 50, each of them taken as repre-\nsentative for the corresponding season. As mentioned above, it has been previously hypothesized that in\nregions where soil moisture is highly coupled to the atmosphere, wet or dry conditions may sustain them-\nselves through positive land feedback causing periods of enhanced \ufb02oods or droughts (respectively) [see,\ne.g., D\u2019Odorico and Porporato, 2004]. While this would re\ufb02ect in bimodal soil moisture distributions, the\nmagnitude and sign of these feedback remain under debate [Ek and Holtslag, 2004; Guillod et al., 2014;\nTaylor et al., 2012]. Most of the bimodal areas found in Figure 2\u2014such as the West and Midwest, central\nAustralia, South Africa, or the Sahel\u2014are in fact regions that have been reported as hot spots of land-\natmosphere coupling, where soil moisture declines (increases) have generally been suggested to yield lower\n(higher) precipitation and higher (lower) air temperature [Koster et al., 2004; D\u2019Odorico and Porporato, 2004;\nMiralles et al., 2012; Tuttle and Salvucci, 2016]. Areas of transitional climate regimes\u2014i.e., where evaporation\nis typically sensitive to the variability of soil moisture [Seneviratne et al., 2010]\u2014are identi\ufb01ed in Koster et al.\n[2004] and Guo et al. [2006] analyses and appear prominently in our results (Figure 2). Nonetheless, Teuling\net al. [2005] indicated that the soil moisture bimodality in regions like Illinois [D\u2019Odorico and Porporato,\n2004] may not necessarily re\ufb02ect land-atmospheric coupling but a combination of climate seasonality and\nnonlinear soil moisture responses. In fact, Figure 2 suggests that several well-known phenomena\u2014such as\nthe annual ground defrosting in Northern latitudes (Figure 2a) or the summer monsoons in Northern India\nand West Africa (Figure 2b)\u2014may yield bimodal soil moisture distributions as well.\nFigure 3a presents our results as the percentage of land area (per latitudinal band) that experiences soil\nmoisture bimodality. Processes that may be expected to cause bimodality appear re\ufb02ected in these latitudi-\nnal pro\ufb01les: the large bimodality at 45\u201360\u00b0N (Figures 3a and 3b for the moving window starting at week 24;\nfrom now on we will refer to as \u201cweek 24\u201d in both text and \ufb01gures) corresponds with the transitional regime\nbetween boreal forest and arid terrain in Asia, which experiences seasonal freeze-thaw processes; the peak at\nFigure 2.

GLOBAL SOIL MOISTURE BIMODALITY 4307\n15\u201320\u00b0N (Figures 3a and 3b for weeks 11, 24, and 37) is mostly due to the bimodality present in the Sahel and\nIndia during the monsoon seasons; and the high values around 30\u00b0S (Figures 3a and 3b for weeks 11, 37, and\n50) correspond mostly to central Australia, a region of potentially high land-atmospheric coupling. CMIP5\nmodels intermittently show a large data range in latitudinal bands (Figures 3a and 3b) associated with both\nmonsoon and freeze-thaw processes suggesting certain degree of disagreement between models with\nregard of timing and location. A large range in percentage of bimodal cell is present in high latitudes\n(Figures 3a and 3b) due to the fact that at high latitudes the amount of grid cells available for analysis is lower\nand the area of each individual grid cell is smaller than in equatorial latitudes, turning the analysis results as\nshown in Figure 3 less tolerant to small errors.\nImportantly, Figure 3a together with Figure 4 indicate that soil moisture bimodality is higher in all CMIP5\nclimate models than in satellite observations: GCMs tend to yield a higher bimodality, for all latitudes and\nall seasons. These higher values are typically more noticeable around the tropics and during the start of\nspring (Figures 3a and 3b for week 11 and Figure 4) and winter (Figures 3a and 3b for week 50 and\nFigure 4) and in high latitudes following the freeze-thaw cycle (Figure 4). While this may re\ufb02ect a misre-\npresentation of soil moisture and land-atmospheric interactions in climate models, it could potentially\nbe affected by the lower spatial resolution at which climate models operate (see Table S1). To test this\nhypothesis, we have replicated the analyses but based on a prior resampling of all data sets to a common\n64 \u00d7 128 latitude-longitude resolution, the spatial resolution of the coarser GCMs (i.e., the Canadian Fourth\nGeneration Atmospheric Global Climate Model, Beijing Climate Center Climate System Model, and Model\nfor Interdisciplinary Research on Climate\u2013Earth System Model). Figure 3b shows that both the latitudinal\ndistribution and intensity of the bimodal response and its scatter and range within each latitudinal band\nare rather independent from the resolution at which data sets are analyzed. In fact, the differences\nbetween GCMs and observations become slightly more prominent when data sets are evaluated at\ncoarser resolution.\nFigure 4 shows the year-round evolution of the difference in bimodal cell count between models (as a multi-\nmodel average) and satellite observations. This \ufb01gure highlights how the difference in soil moisture bimod-\nality discussed in previous paragraphs varies during the whole year following the geographical evolution of\nland-atmosphere processes, showing a generally smooth evolution of the models-satellite discrepancy. The\nevolution of the freeze-thaw process is particularly clear, together with the monsoons. The blue areas indicat-\ning a higher satellite bimodal grid-cell count appear near the masked areas and in close proximity with the\ndeep red areas suggesting a generalized timing discrepancy between CMIP5 models and AMSR-E regarding\nfreeze-thaw in high latitudes.\nFigure 4.

Latitude is shown in the vertical axis and week-of-the-year number on the horizontal axis. Each square depicts the\nintegrated results of a latitudinal band for each week of the year. The normalized difference between the number of\nbimodal cells in models minus bimodal cells in the observational data set are color coded ([CMIP5 cells \u0002 AMSR-E cells]/\nanalyzed cells), with red meaning a positive number, thus indicating a higher number of bimodal cells in a given latitude\nand time of the year.\nJournal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres 10.1002/2016JD026099\nVILASA ET AL. GLOBAL SOIL MOISTURE BIMODALITY 4308\nTaylor et al. [2012] indicated a strong preference for positive soil moisture-precipitation feedback in current\nGCMs. This model behavior, favoring the likelihood of precipitation over wetter soils and disfavoring it under\ndry conditions, is a likely explanation for the higher values of soil moisture bimodality in GCM found in our\nanalyses. This tendency to exaggerate the positive sign of this land-atmosphere feedback was also suggested\nby Koster et al. [2006] andMccrary and Randall [2010] and potentially relates to errors in the representation of\nthe diurnal cycle of precipitation and particularly of deep convection [Guichard et al., 2004]. However, our\nbimodality diagnostic should be taken as an integrative measure of the representation of soil moisture-\nclimate interactions, which incorporates a plethora of factors; aiming to identify a single process responsible\nfor the discrepancies between GCMs and observations is therefore not in the scope of this analysis.\n5. Conclusion\nSoil moisture bimodality still remains by and large an elusive concept. In order to perform a global assess-\nment of bimodality, several analytical steps have been followed. Our framework estimates soil moisture\nbimodality in regions and times in which global processes that are thought to be associated to bimodal\ndistributions occur; this is the case of freeze-thaw processes or summer monsoons. In addition, CMIP5models\nshow a clearly higher values on bigger areas in which bimodality occurs. Even though models follow a\ncommon pattern, they strongly differ from the observation-based results, and this divergence does not\nrespond to the higher resolution of the observations. A possible explanation for this behavior is that models\ntend to \u201clock-in\u201d dry or wet conditions due to unrealistically positive soil moisture-precipitation feedback, a\nfeature that has already been highlighted in previous studies. Our diagnostic of soil moisture bimodality\nappears therefore as an integrative tool to identify land-climate interactions and to benchmark their repre-\nsentation in climate models.\nReferences\nAlbergel, C., G.
