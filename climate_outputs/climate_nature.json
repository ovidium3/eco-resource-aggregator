While \nsome climate plans included actions for shoreline erosion, coastal inundation, and storm \nsurges, only one addressed sea level rise impacts on buildings and heritage (i.e. Redland).  \n \n \nIntroduction \n \n \nClimate change adaptation and mitigation is now a key issue for local governments, \nespecially coastal councils (Nursey-Bray, 2010; Vasey-Ellis, 2009). In Queensland, climate \nchange impacts on coastal areas include the effects of tropical cyclones, storm surges, \nflooding, sea level rise (SLR), tidal inundation, and shoreline erosion. Recent news articles \nhighlight planning issues, building codes, insurance risk, and the cost of impacts on coastal \nareas from tropical cyclones (Bita, 2011), state-wide flooding during summer 2010/2011 \n(The Courier Mail, 2011; Williams & Bita, 2011), and SLR impacts on Queensland\u2019s coast \n(Abel et al, 2011; Collins, 2011; Houghton, 2011; PIA, 2011; Williams, 2011). A projected \nSLR of 1.1m by 2100 will affect low-lying infrastructure and buildings in LGAs of coastal \nQueensland, mainly Brisbane, Gold Coast, Moreton Bay, Fraser Coast, Mackay, and \nTownsville (DCCEE, 2011a). The Local Government Association of Queensland established \na Coastal Councils Adaptation Taskforce (C-CAT) in early 2011 to address this risk, with 16 \ncoastal councils now members. There is also a Queensland representative on the National \nCoasts and Climate Change Council, the mayor of Bundaberg. The new Queensland \nCoastal Plan requires councils to prepare coastal hazard adaptation plans for those parts of \ntheir urban areas at risk, related to a projected SLR of 80cm by 2100, with related guidelines \nfor coastal management, protection and hazards (DERM, 2011). The growing impacts of \ncoastal development, climate change and sea level rise are key issues in Southeast \nQueensland (Abel et al., 2011; Dedekorkut et. al., 2010; Wang et al., 2010). Moreover, \n\u2018...ongoing coastal development and population growth in areas such as Cairns and South \nEast Queensland...are projected to exacerbate risks from sea level rise and increases in the \nseverity and frequency of storms and coastal flooding by 2050\u2019 (IPPC, 2007, cited in SCC, \n2010, p. 13). Councils applying for state government grants for new infrastructure projects \nmust address adaptation to minimise climate impacts (DIP, 2010). In planning for climate \nchange, councils thus need to promote adaptive capacity which is \u2018the ability of built, natural, \nand human systems to accommodate changes in climate (including climate variability and \nclimate extremes) with minimal potential damage or cost\u2019 (SCC, 2010, p. 56). Council \nplanning for Queensland coastal areas focuses on hazards and risk management, with new \nplanning guidelines to assess risks to communities and a three to five year phase in of \ncoastal hazard plans to allow councils time to prepare adaptation strategies (DERM, 2011). \n \n \nQueensland coastal councils \n \n \nThere are 35 coastal councils in Queensland, covering half (47%) of all councils in the state. \nIn total, there are 73 councils across Queensland (city, regional, shire, & Aboriginal shire); \nwith a separate Weipa Town Authority managing this mining town on Cape York Peninsula. \nThe coastal councils comprise four city councils (i.e. Brisbane, Gold Coast, Redland, & \nTownsville); 14 regional councils (i.e. Bundaberg, Cairns, Cassowary Coast, Fraser Coast, \nGladstone, Gympie, Isaac, Mackay, Moreton Bay, Northern Peninsula Area, Rockhampton, \nSunshine Coast, Torres Strait Island, & Whitsunday); eight shire councils (i.e.  Aurukun, \nBurdekin, Burke, Carpentaria, Cook, Hinchinbrook, Mornington, & Torres); and nine \nAboriginal shire councils (i.e. Hope Vale, Kowanyama, Lockhart River, Mapoon, Napranum, \nPalm Island, Porpmuraaw, Wujal Wujal, & Yarrabah). The coastal shire and Aboriginal shire \ncouncils are all located in North Queensland, Cape York and around the Gulf of Carpentaria.  \nThis paper focuses on coastal councils in South East Queensland, and the Cairns council. \n \n \nClimate change impacts on Queensland coastal areas \n \n \nSome 85% of Queensland\u2019s population lives on or near coastal areas, with 73% of \nQueensland\u2019s coastline comprising open sandy beaches (DERM, 2011). The coastal local \ngovernment areas in South East Queensland (SEQ) are among the top ten areas at risk of \ninundation from flooding, sea level rise (SLR) and storm surges (Dedekorkut et al., 2010), \nwith 245,000 people at risk of SLR impacts by 2030 (Wang et al., 2010). Over 70% of \ncommercial buildings in SEQ are located within 5km of the shoreline; with the SEQ Regional \nPlan 2009-2031 allowing for 502,000 more houses along the SEQ coast by 2031. Climate \nchange impacts on Queensland\u2019s coastal areas include:  more severe tropical cyclones (e.g. \nCyclone Yasi, 2011 and Cyclone Larry, 2006); storm surges; flooding; sea level rise; coastal \ninundation (high tide/king tide/storm tide); beach/dune erosion; shoreline recession; and \nestuary instability. These climate impacts affect beaches, dunes and shorelines and cause \ndamage to coastal buildings, roads, electricity, ports, airports, schools, hospitals, industrial \nsites, landfills, recreation areas, water and sewerage plants; and emergency facilities. The \nclimate change impacts on coastal infrastructure from SLR and storm events include: \nstructural damage and fatigue; accelerated degradation of foundations and materials; \nincreased ground movement; groundwater changes; and flooding (DCCEE, 2009).  \n \nIn coastal Queensland, up to 4,700km of roads, 570km of railways and 1,400 commercial \nbuildings are at risk from SLR of 1.1m by 2100 (DCCEE, 2011a) (Table 1). Key Queensland \nairports are also located in vulnerable low-lying coastal areas prone to flooding, such as \nBrisbane, Cairns, and Coolangatta on the Gold Coast. With  0.8m SLR by 2100, the \nQueensland Coastal Plan states 94,000 buildings will be partially inundated (with 10,650 \nbuildings in Brisbane); while 65,000 properties will be affected by storm surge inundation. In \nSEQ, almost 9,000 homes are within 110m of erodible shoreline; 32,500 homes are exposed \nto a 2.5m storm tide; with 61,500 homes at risk from storm tides by 2030 (DERM, 2011). \nQueensland has the highest number of at risk residential buildings in Australia\u2019s coastal \nzone located within 55m (n=5,400) or 100m (n=15,200) of \u2018soft\u2019 coastlines. Between 48,300 \nand 67,700 houses, worth $15 to $20 billion, are at risk from SLR of 1.1m by 2100 (DCCEE, \n2011b). Despite this high level of exposure and vulnerability to climate change impacts in \nQueensland (Bajracharya, Childs & Hastings, 2011), few coastal councils have completed a \nclimate change risk assessment (i.e. Moreton Bay, Redland) or climate change plan. \n \n \nTable 1.

The actions in these plans are analysed for their adaptive response \ncategories: Emphasising Nature, Emphasising Development and Managed Nature (Vasey-\nEllis, 2009), along with Council Governance of climate change, and Emphasising \nCommunities. The adaptation options in coastal planning include: Relocate and prevent \ndevelopment or unsustainable land use, Designate protected land, Create setback buffers, \nCreate wetlands and revegetate vulnerable areas (Emphasising Nature); Private insurance \nfor vulnerable properties, Developers accept full risk, Elevate buildings and change building \ncodes, Build hard structures (Emphasising Development); and Beach nourishment, Build \nartificial reefs (Managed Nature) (Vasey-Ellis, 2009). The climate actions stated in climate \nchange strategies for Cairns, Gold Coast, Redland, Sunshine Coast, and Bribie Island are \nanalysed according to which main adaptation response category they best fit.  \n \nThe category, Emphasising Nature, focuses on protecting the environment (e.g. beaches, \ndunes, habitat, park land, plants, waterways, and wildlife) to buffer the effects of climate \nchange on nature and also to protect developed areas from climate hazards. The category, \nEmphasising Development, focuses on protecting the built environment through insurance, \nbuilding codes and engineering responses to limit damage to council, public and private \nproperty (i.e. assets, infrastructure, hazards, and risk). Managed Nature refers to \u2018natural\u2019 \nengineering options such as replacing beach sand by pumping or trucks. Emphasising \nCommunity refers to public access, consultation, engagement, health risks, or safety issues \nin regard to climate impacts. Council Governance refers to internal council processes for \ndealing with climate change issues through frameworks, leadership, policy, strategies, staff \ntraining, and reports. Climate impacts affect both communities and councils. Climate change \nplanning and infrastructure responses by Queensland coastal councils mainly focus on \nprotecting coastal development from erosion and other climate hazards, and building \ncommunity resilience, supplemented by environmental actions protecting nature as a buffer.  \n \n \nClimate change strategies by Queensland coastal councils \n \n \nOnly five Queensland coastal councils have prepared climate change strategies or action \nplans, including Brisbane (BCC, 2007), Cairns (CRC, 2009, 2010), Gold Coast (GCCC, \n2010), Redland (RCC, 2010), and Sunshine Coast (SCC, 2010). These climate change \nplans cover the main urban centres in SEQ and the far north Queensland coast, with these \nlarger coastal councils also leaders in the Cities for Climate Protection program (Table 2). A \nclimate change plan was in progress for Moreton Bay Regional Council, between Brisbane \nand the Sunshine Coast, with actions approved by council members in September 2011 for \nthis plan. The Bribie Island community in the Moreton Bay council area has already \ndeveloped their own climate adaptation plan with SEQ Catchments (Chapman, 2010). Three \nSEQ coastal councils have also prepared shoreline erosion management plans, a coastal \ndune policy, and beach nourishment programs for key beaches (Table 2). Only one inland \nQueensland council, the Southern Downs, had a climate change adaptation action plan.  \n \n \nTable 2.

Adaptation strategies in the plan were \namending the City Plan to reduce exposure to flooding and storm surges, and disaster \nmanagement planning. The adaptation actions all related to risk management measures:  \n\u2018Funding adaptation measures such as relocation of buildings and infrastructure from high \nrisk areas as necessary\u2019 (Action 3c); \u2018Upgrade the Q100 flood level; Enhanced stormwater \nand flood-related infrastructure requirements\u2019 (Action 13a); \u2018Require forward planning for \nCouncil assets, especially water supply, wastewater treatment plants, stormwater, roads and \nbridges\u2019 (Action 22a); \u2018Establish flooding and storm surge response plans\u2019 (Action 23a); and \n\u2018Understanding sea level rise and storm surge impacts on Brisbane\u2019 (Action 30a). Only two \nadaptation actions addressed coastal impacts in this Brisbane climate action plan. State \nplanning policies on flooding still don\u2019t consider SLR or storm surge impacts (PIA, 2011). \nThis paper now reviews adaptive actions in climate change strategies by four other urban \ncoastal councils, Cairns, Gold Coast, Redland, and Sunshine Coast, and for Bribie Island.  \n \nThe climate action plans for Bribie Island, Cairns, Gold Coast, Redland, and Sunshine Coast \nincluded strategies for climate change mitigation and adaptation, environmental protection \nand building community resilience to climate change (Table 3). Specific actions for \nadaptation were included in the strategies for Sunshine Coast (n=25) and Cairns (n=9). The \nSunshine Coast adaptation actions were further divided between Objective 5: Identify and \nplan for climate change risks (n=14), and Objective 6: Adapt to the impacts of climate \nchange (n=11). The climate strategies for Bribie Island, Gold Coast and Redland included a \nmix of both mitigation and adaptation actions in key areas, including the natural environment \n(i.e. biodiversity, shoreline, & water), planning and infrastructure (Bribie, Gold Coast) or \ndevelopment and council assets/services plus community safety and resilience (Redland). \nThe Cairns strategy had a \u2018transition\u2019 section with nine actions about community resilience. \nSpecific actions for council governance and leadership on climate change responses were \nincluded in strategies for Cairns, the Gold Coast, and Sunshine Coast. The Bribie Island plan \nincluded sections with community concerns about shoreline and emergency management. \nOther climate actions for mitigation and/or energy use in the Cairns, Redland and Sunshine \nCoast climate change strategies were not included in this analysis of adaptation responses. \n \n \nTable 3.

These included the three adaptation \nresponse categories employed by Vasey-Ellis (2009) to assess Victorian coastal planning: \nemphasising development, emphasising nature and managed nature, along with two other \nresponse categories, council governance and emphasising community, added by the author. \nThis analysis highlighted the varied responses to climate adaptation actions by councils \n(Table 4). The Cairns, Sunshine Coast, and Gold Coast strategies focused on council \ngovernance to implement climate actions, along with actions emphasising nature to protect \nthe environment, assets, and public areas. Emphasising nature was the main adaptation \nresponse in the community plan for Bribie Island (n=52, 73%), and council plan for Redland \n(n=48, 49%), by protecting the environment and facilities from adverse climate effects. \nEmphasising community was the second adaptation response category in the strategies for \nRedland, Bribie Island, and Cairns, with actions focused on community resilience and safety \nfrom climate hazards. There were only two actions for the response category, managed \nnature, with an artificial reef (Bribie Island) and controlling vegetation for fire management \n(Redland). The beach nourishment and sand replenishment at beaches on the Gold Coast, \nSunshine Coast and in Cairns (see Table 2) were not mentioned as actions. Climate actions \nin the four council plans focused on protecting council, public and private property in at-risk \ncoastal areas, along with mitigations actions to reduce council and community emissions, \nand insurance for council assets. This is due to the high level of coastal development and \npopulation growth in both SEQ and in Cairns, and council liability to reduce risk from climate \nimpacts through planning and adaptation. Overall, in these five climate plans, the total \nactions by adaptation response categories were: emphasising nature (45.8%), council \ngovernance (25.3%), emphasising community (20.2%), and emphasising development \n(8.2%). The council plans had a key focus on governance actions (33% vs. 0 in Bribie plan). \n \n \nTable 4.

The climate plan for Redland City included actions for sea \nlevel rise impacts and coastal inundation of beaches and foreshores (Table 5), to protect \nnatural and built environments. Planning options, legislation, and costs were all considered \nfor Redland assets and areas vulnerable to inundation by storm tide, flooding or sea level \nrise. Some 22 actions (out of 98) addressed coastal climate change impacts on Redland \ncouncil assets and infrastructure including landfills; beaches/foreshores; and public open \nspace. These coastal adaptation actions were for storm tides/surges/water (n=14), sea level \nrise (n=9), and coastal inundation (n=9). Coastal wetlands were listed as soft infrastructure.  \nTable 5.

Responses included vulnerability and hazard mapping of major risk areas due to \nclimate change along with coastal erosion and inundation impacts in coastal management. \nThere was only one coastal adaptation action (of 15) in this strategy, \u2018Develop a coastal \nmanagement strategy with shoreline erosion management plans where appropriate\u2019 (SCC, \n2010, p. 51). Storm surges are eroding popular Sunshine Coast beaches such as at Noosa. \nCoastal adaption actions in the Bribie Island plan also relate to shoreline management (n=9) \ndue to erosion of beaches on both sides of the island. The actions address community \ninvolvement in preparing a shoreline erosion management plan, and other \u2018soft\u2019 options such \nas groundcover on dunes, protecting mangroves, education about dunes as a wave buffer, \nan artificial reef to protect beaches, and reducing impacts from boat wash and propellers. \nClimate planning needs to protect coastal ecosystems as a vital climate buffer and defence. \n \n \nConclusions \n \n \nThis paper reviewed adaptation actions in climate change strategies by four Queensland \ncoastal councils, Cairns, Gold Coast, Redland, and Sunshine Coast, and for Bribie Island. \nThe climate change strategies for Cairns, Gold Coast, and the Sunshine Coast mainly \nfocused on council governance of climate actions, while adaptive actions emphasising \nnature were the main focus of the Bribie and Redland plans. The adaptive actions by the \nfour urban coastal councils focused on emphasising nature (37%), council governance \n(33%), emphasising community (20%), and emphasising development (8%). Emphasising \nnature (64%) was also the main adaptive response of Victorian coastal councils (Vasey-Ellis, \n2009). Queensland coastal councils adopted a mix of adaptive strategies similar to Victoria, \nbut coastal climate hazards and actions were only considered in the Redland (n=22), and \nBribie Island (n=9) plans. In Queensland, there is less protection of coastal ecosystems and \nliability laws favour developers with a lower priority for nature-based adaptation options and \ngrowing pressure for built defences to protect valuable coastal assets (Abel et al., 2011).  \nReferences \nAbel, N., Gorddard, R., Harman, B., Leitch, A., Langridge, J., Ryan, A. & Heyenga, S.  \n (2011).

IntroductionCliquet et al.1 provide a thought-provoking analysis of the challenges posed to the EU\u2019s protectedareas by climate change. This paper seeks to build on some of the perspectives they brought towhat is a highly challenging area of nature conservation law, policy and practice. While there ismuch to support in their analysis of the relationships between protected areas and climate change,there are two key strands we seek to develop further, based on the RSPB\u2019s experience of this areaof nature conservation policy and practice: first, is the ecological model for adapting to climatechange and second, the legal framework provided by the Birds2 and Habitats3 Directives (theNature Directives) as it relates to the delivery of such adaptive actions.As an organisation, the RSPB is deeply involved in nature conservation legislative practiceand development, as well as practical land management through nature reserve holdings compris-ing 206 reserves on 142,044 hectares, 112 of which overlap wholly or partially with SpecialProtection Areas4 (SPAs) under the Birds Directive. Across this broad area of work, we arealready facing many of the practical, policy and legal challenges outlined by Cliquet et al. Weagree with the authors that climate change demands a more flexible approach to the applicationof the Nature Directives, but diverge from their conclusion that portrays the Directives as static,through concentrating on protecting the \u2018existing values\u2019 of protected areas.5In this paper, we seek to develop some of the ideas in Cliquet et al. by considering climatechange adaptation in the context of the requirements of the Nature Directives as a whole. First,ANDREW DODD, ALICE HARDIMAN, KATE JENNINGS & GWYN WILLIAMS6 P.F. Donald et al., \u2018International conservation policy delivers benefits for birds in Europe\u2019, 2007 Science 317, no. 5839, pp. 810-813.7 See note 1, supra, p. 160.8 B. Huntley et al., A climatic atlas of European breeding birds, 2007.9 See note 6, supra.142we summarise the ecological responses necessary to ensure Europe\u2019s wildlife can adapt toclimate change and the role of protected areas within that response. Then we seek to summarisewhy we believe the Nature Directives can already facilitate the positive, dynamic approachneeded to address climate change.2. Protected areas: Sustaining ecological functions in the face of climate changeProtected areas work. Recent work6 looking at population trends for all wild birds in Europe since1970 has shown how important the Birds Directive has been for these birds, especially those onAnnex I. The rate of recovery of Annex I species has been significantly greater inside the EUthan outside, and within the EU has been greater for Annex I species than species not listed onthe Annex. The role of protected areas in this recovery is critical. The greater the area of SPAs,the stronger the recovery, especially for the rare and vulnerable species on Annex I. This wasborne out by evidence that these trends were more positive in those countries that designatedlarger areas of SPAs.Cliquet et al. rightly identify geographical shifts in suitable climate conditions as perhapsthe most noticeable of the climate change impacts on wildlife and the one with greatest implica-tions for protected areas.7 For example, the modelling of the impacts of climate change on birdsby Huntley et al. has predicted that, by the end of the century, the majority of European breedingbird species\u2019 ranges are likely to have shifted towards the north and north-east by around500-1,000 kilometres, but with wide variation between species:8 three quarters are likely to sufferdeclines in range.It is this \u2018spatial response\u2019 by species that has led some commentators to question thevalidity of protected areas in society\u2019s response to climate change, suggesting that they are in thewrong places, deemed too static to cope with species shifts. This is sometimes accompanied bycalls for their abandonment and/or wholesale movement. This overlooks several key roles thatprotected areas play in society\u2019s response to the geographical shifts in suitable climate conditionsfor species, which we outline below.2.1. Protected areas \u2013 building resilience and accommodationTomorrow\u2019s biodiversity can only come from today\u2019s, and so building resilience into remainingpopulations is a vital first step in enabling adaptation. Protected areas will be a key mechanism,as demonstrated by Donald et al. through their role in aiding population recovery.9The objectives of protected areas are to remove current land use pressures (e.g. fromagriculture or built development), and to bring sites into a favourable condition. Both objectiveswill enhance resilience to climate change. However, we must also seek to accommodate changeas species respond to the changing climate. For some taxa, providing suitable micro-climateswithin a protected area may be sufficient. Others will need to move between protected areas inorder to find suitable climate and habitat. As the wider countryside fails to provide habitat formany species, protected areas will play an important role in enabling them to \u2018track\u2019 suitableclimate conditions. The suite of species present at a given site will thereby change over time, andsite management will need to change to accommodate this.Protected areas and climate change \u2013 Reflections from a practitioner\u2019s perspective10 See for example: RSPB, RSPB Reserves 2007, p. 54 and RSPB Reserves 2008, p. 86.11 See for example: R.K.A. Morris et al., \u2018The creation of compensatory habitat \u2013 can it secure sustainable development?\u2019, 2006 Journal forNature Conservation 14, no. 2, pp. 106-116.1432.2. Protected areas \u2013 managing for changing objectivesNature conservation can accommodate species\u2019 spatial responses without the need to relocateprotected areas. The conservation objectives of such sites must take account of species\u2019 spatialresponse to climate change. This will be an important component in supporting adaptation withinthe site network. Changes in site objectives will need to occur at different temporal and spatialscales for different species. In all cases, these must take account of a species\u2019 wider conservationstatus and distribution.Dynamic site management has already begun. On its own suite of over 200 nature reserves,the RSPB has started to trial a new approach to conservation management planning.10 This makesuse of all available information about future climate conditions and possible species\u2019 responsesin determining both site objectives and site management. Inevitably, it will be subject to periodicreview as our knowledge and understanding of species\u2019 responses improves. Similar approachesare equally relevant to the Natura 2000 network. There is, as Cliquet et al. highlight, a tensionbetween providing certainty to land managers and decision-makers and the ability to responddynamically to climate change.2.3. Protected areas \u2013 habitat creation to support adaptationMaking existing protected areas larger through habitat creation is important for building resil-ience (by buffering sites from external pressures) and accommodating change (by providing thespace to allow for diverse site management). For example, where existing sites are being lost tocoastal erosion, habitat creation plays an important role in providing replacement habitat forvulnerable populations.In some circumstances, habitat creation has an important role to play in accommodatingchange by providing new sites. Habitat creation is most successful for relatively simpleplagioclimax habitats, such as reedbed and heathland, in which the structural components of thehabitat are short-lived. However, many habitats, especially those that are older and morebiologically specialised, such as ancient woodland, are difficult if not impossible to replace, sothis is not a total solution.2.4. Protected areas \u2013 sustaining ecological functionsProtected areas are not just important for the species that reside within them, but also theunderpinning environmental conditions or site function many of which have taken decades, if notcenturies, to develop. Key environmental conditions such as low-nutrient soils, high waterquality, particular geologies and topographies are now rare in the wider landscape, but wellrepresented in the protected area portfolio. Conditions like these are the foundation of diverseecological communities. They will go on being so, regardless of the species that make up thosecommunities. Both species shifting their distribution within Member States, and those extendingtheir distribution into Member States, will be seeking these basic environmental conditions.In situ conservation through protected areas is key to sustaining these ecological functions.Once lost, most of these environmental conditions and site functions can never be recovered.11Where recovery can be attempted, the timescales are long, and the cost often prohibitive.Therefore, safeguarding the inherent ecological conditions provided by protected areas will beANDREW DODD, ALICE HARDIMAN, KATE JENNINGS & GWYN WILLIAMS12 Art. 2(2) Habitats Directive, supra note 3. Favourable conservation status does not appear on the face of the Birds Directive. However, theEC has argued the obligation extends to the Birds Directive (supra note 2) and is implicit in its Art. 2 \u2013 see CEC, Guidance Document onHunting under Council Directive 79/409/EEC on the Conservation of Wild Birds: the Birds Directive, 2004, European Commission, Brussels.Given this, for the remainder of the paper we use \u2018favourable conservation status\u2019 as shorthand for the Art. 2 requirements of both the Habitatsand Birds Directives.13 Art. 3(1) of the Habitats Directive (supra note 3) requires the establishment of a coherent network of protected areas, known as Natura 2000,to \u2018enable the natural habitat types and the species\u2019 habitats concerned to be maintained or, where appropriate, restored at a favourableconservation status in their natural range\u2019. The construction of Art. 3(1) appears to restrict this objective for Natura 2000 to habitats andspecies listed on Annexes I and II of the Habitats Directive. However, the European Commission has recognised the relevance of thefavourable conservation status objective to the Birds Directive (see note 12, supra).14 European Commission, Assessment, Monitoring and Reporting under Article 17 of the Habitats Directive: Explanatory Notes and Guidelines.Final Draft. October 2006, 2006, European Commission, Brussels.144vital in ensuring those species shifting distribution can discover the basic ecological \u2018infrastruc-ture\u2019 they require.2.5. An integrated, dynamic approachTaken together, these approaches to protected area management should place the Natura 2000network at the hub of a more integrated, dynamic and responsive approach to biodiversityconservation, helping wildlife adapt to a changing climate.3. How do the Nature Directives meet the ecological challenges?In our view, Cliquet et al. took a relatively narrow reading of the Nature Directives that placedgreat emphasis on the site-protection elements of both Directives. We outline below why webelieve a fuller reading results in different conclusions being drawn about the flexibility of theNature Directives. Their focus on the site protection elements of the Directives is understandablegiven that Member States have themselves placed such great emphasis on protected areaprovision \u2013 almost to the exclusion of everything else.3.1. Brief r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the habitat conservation provisions of the Nature DirectivesBoth the Birds and Habitats Directives adopt a twin-track approach to biodiversity conservation.They use a combination of habitat conservation and species conservation measures to attain thegoal of favourable conservation status (FCS). 12 Habitat conservation lies at the heart of bothDirectives, with great emphasis given to the establishment of the Natura 2000 network.13However, it is our view that there has been a general failure to consider protected areas as partof an integrated package of measures that the Nature Directives require to deliver this overarch-ing objective.Below we outline the overarching purpose of the Nature Directives, highlight the relevantprovisions in each Directive and summarise how they can combine to address the ecologicalchallenges outlined in Section 2.3.1.1. Overarching purpose of the Nature DirectivesThe overall purpose of the Nature Directives is straightforward: to maintain species and habitatsat a level where they are not regarded as threatened, that is at \u2018favourable conservation status\u2019.The EC\u2019s own guidance14 to Member States describes FCS in plain language: it [FCS] is reachedwhen a habitat or species is prospering, with good prospects of doing so in the future. Article 2in both the Birds and Habitats Directives sets out these requirements in general terms. Thedifferent language used to describe it reflects the fact they were drafted 13 years apart. However,Protected areas and climate change \u2013 Reflections from a practitioner\u2019s perspective15 Art. 2 Birds Directive.16 R. Sutherland et al., \u2018Climate Change and the Birds and Habitats Directives: can they work together?\u2019, 2005 Ecos 26, no. 3/4, pp. 86-94.17 See Case C-355/90, Santona Marshes, [1993] ECR I-4221, Advocate General Opinion at Para. 58.18 See Art. 3(2)(a) Birds Directive.19 See Art. 3(2)(c) Birds Directive.145both are driven by the ecological requirements of the species and habitats concerned and bothbuild in flexibility to deal with changing environmental circumstances such as climate change:\u2013 the Habitats Directive explicitly defines FCS by reference to the long-term needs of thehabitat or species concerned (see Article 1(e) and 1(i) respectively);\u2013 the Birds Directive requires the maintenance of populations at levels that correspond inparticular to ecological, scientific and cultural requirements. Population levels must bedefined by reference to these requirements. Clearly, if any of the requirements change, thepopulation objectives (such as numbers, range, distribution) will need to be adjustedaccordingly.Therefore, the Nature Directives demand a clear understanding of what constitutes FCS for thespecies and habitats they seek to conserve, including provision to maintain that over the long-term in light of changing circumstances. The Habitats Directive sheds more light on this byreferring to the \u2018sum of influences\u2019 acting on a species or habitat over the long-term: it makes nodistinction between natural or man-made influences. Translating this concept into delivery inpractical terms is challenging and demands a careful analysis of the actions needed now to bringhabitats and species into a healthy status combined with constant vigilance to maintain that statusin the future.FCS provides the framework that the various measures set out in the Nature Directives areworking to attain. Unfortunately, there has been a general failure to look at the Nature Directivesthrough the lens of FCS. This has led to the measures in them being implemented in a less thanintegrated way. In dealing with climate change or any other pressures, it is important to view thearticles of the Nature Directives as a means to deliver FCS. This requires consideration of howthe various objectives, duties and powers they contain can be applied to provide a practical andcomprehensive response to deliver FCS.3.1.2. Birds DirectiveAs outlined above, the Birds Directive requires that all wild bird populations be maintained \u2018atlevels that correspond in particular to ecological, scientific and cultural requirements\u2019 or the \u2018theappropriate population level\u2019.15 Sutherland et al. rightly described this as a strong starting point,because it means that if climate change causes or exacerbates bird population declines throughadverse effects on their habitats, then action is required to address this. 16 Articles 3 and 4 of theBirds Directive set out the measures for habitat conservation for all wild bird species: a carefulanalysis shows that while protected areas are a core element, a wider range of measures isenvisaged as contributing to FCS:\u2013 Article 3 focuses on preserving, maintaining or even re-establishing a \u2018sufficient diversityand area of habitats\u2019 for all wild birds, sufficient to meet the defined population level underArticle 2.17 The measures comprise a number of approaches including the creation ofhabitats18 or the re-establishment of destroyed biotopes19 to replace any that may be lostANDREW DODD, ALICE HARDIMAN, KATE JENNINGS & GWYN WILLIAMS20 See Case C-355/90, Santona Marshes, [1993] ECR I-4221, ECJ at Para. 15; Advocate General Opinion at Para. 58, note 17, supra.21 Annex I species (Art. 4(1)) and regularly occurring migratory species (Art. 4(2)).22 See Habitats Directive Art. 3-5 (designation) and Art. 6 (management and protection).146(provided the creation precedes the loss so as to maintain the diversity and area in questionthrough the change20);\u2013 Article 4 requires special conservation measures for certain species of wild birds21 to ensuretheir survival and reproduction in their area of distribution, with particular reference to theclassification of the \u2018most suitable territories\u2019 as SPAs. Many Member States have focusedall their attention on the designation and protection of the \u2018most suitable territories\u2019 asSPAs, to the exclusion of any additional measures needed \u2018to ensure [the species\u2019] survivaland reproduction\u2019. Consequently, these (and Article 3 measures) are significantly underde-veloped, yet they are likely to prove crucial in supporting protected areas as part of theresponse to climate change.3.1.3. Habitats DirectiveThe Habitats Directive imposes obligations to conserve certain listed species of animals, plantsand habitat types, including protection from the impacts of climate change. As discussed above,the purpose of this conservation is to maintain or, where necessary, restore those habitats andspecies to FCS. It is true that there is greater emphasis on the designation, management andprotection of protected areas, i.e. SACs,22 in comparison to the more comprehensive approachto habitat conservation set out in the Birds Directive. However, the framework provided by theDirective is broader than SACs:\u2013 Article 3(1) sets out a duty to classify SACs, which like that for SPAs, is ongoing;\u2013 Article 6(1) sets out a duty to establish the necessary conservation measures for SACs, withsome discretion over the mechanisms used;\u2013 In non-plan or project situations (see Articles 6(3)-(4) below), Article 6(2) protects SACsand SPAs by requiring appropriate steps to avoid the deterioration of habitats or habitatsof species and significant disturbance to species, in relation to the objectives of theDirective, i.e. the achievement of FCS;\u2013 Under Articles 6(3) and 6(4), plans or projects that threaten SPAs or SACs, are given strictprotection with derogations in very limited circumstances, with compensation measuresrequired where damage is permitted;\u2013 Article 3(3) and Article 10 of the Habitats Directive stress the importance of protectionoutside the Natura 2000 network, so that Member States should endeavour to maintain and,where appropriate, develop features of the landscape that are of major importance for wildflora and fauna.3.1.4. The Nature Directives \u2013 meeting the ecological challenges of climate changeThe Nature Directives do indeed place an emphasis on protecting today\u2019s wildlife where it is \u2013this is based on a sound ecological approach that in situ conservation is more robust and reliablethan attempting to create or restore conditions that may have taken centuries to evolve. However,they also possess the tools to ensure a flexible response to the ecological demands imposed byclimate change.Managing and protecting the Natura 2000 network will continue to be central to the EU\u2019sresponse to dealing with the effects of climate change on biodiversity:Protected areas and climate change \u2013 Reflections from a practitioner\u2019s perspective147\u2013 In situ conservation will remain a priority. Given that the purpose of Natura 2000 sites isto make a significant contribution to the achievement of FCS for relevant species andhabitats, then a fundamental requirement today is to ensure each site is managed so that itachieves the favourable condition described in its conservation objectives. This will makethe wildlife they protect more able to resist ongoing pressures and therefore withstand theeffects of climate change. It will also ensure the species they support are prospering suchthat they can provide source populations to colonise new areas should their climate spacebegin to shift;\u2013 Where in situ conditions begin to deteriorate due to climate change such that the conserva-tion objectives of a Natura 2000 site cannot be fully met, Article 6(2) of the HabitatsDirective provides the trigger to consider the most appropriate response. It will force theconsideration of additional management measures within the Natura 2000 site to increaseits resilience to climate change. In extremis, where such measures are not practicable thenderogation may be justified in very limited circumstances. However, given the overallpurposes of the Directives, further measures will be needed to ensure FCS is maintained:\u2013 for SACs, consideration would need to be given to Article 6(1) to assess whetherfurther \u2018conservation measures\u2019 would be necessary to make up for that loss; \u2013 for SPAs, it is our view that further measures would need to be considered and ifnecessary taken under Articles 3 and 4 of the Birds Directive to comply with theobligations set out in those articles. We have already seen examples of this approachin the United Kingdom, for example the commitment to provide replacement habitatfor the partial loss of breeding and wintering waterbird interests on the Ouse WashesSPA due to increased summer and winter flooding;\u2013 Where plans or projects are being carried out in response to climate change for humansafety objectives \u2013 for example the construction of new sea defences \u2013 Articles 6(3) and6(4) are relevant, in that appropriate assessment will be required to assess whether thereis an adverse effect on Natura 2000 sites. In many cases, such projects are likely to pass the\u2018alternative solutions\u2019 and \u2018imperative reasons of overriding public interest\u2019 tests and thuscompensatory habitat will be required to maintain the functions of the protected areanetwork. In the UK, the loss of SPA reedbeds on the coast of East Anglia to sea level riseand the realignment of sea defences are being compensated for by the creation of newreedbed habitat in sustainable inland locations;\u2013 Classification of new protected areas may be required. Flexibility is inherent in the SPAclassification regime. As an ongoing duty, it allows for new classifications from time totime depending on what the conservation of the species requires. If climate change altersthe conservation requirements then adjustments to the qualifying interests, site conserva-tion objectives and, where necessary, classifications will have to follow. The ability toclassify new SPAs is supported by the seventh recital of the Habitats Directive: \u2018Whereasall the areas designated, including those classified now [i.e. meaning 1992] or in the futureas [SPAs] (...) will have to be incorporated into the coherent European ecological network\u2019.Outside of protected areas, the Nature Directives provide a number of measures that can helpincrease resilience and provide accommodation for species and habitats:\u2013 Article 4(4) of the Birds Directive makes clear that outside SPAs Annex I and migratorybird species are subject to a duty on Member States to strive to avoid pollution or deteriora-tion of habitats. This would apply to new habitats colonised by birds moving in responseANDREW DODD, ALICE HARDIMAN, KATE JENNINGS & GWYN WILLIAMS23 See Case C-418/04, Commission v.

The European Court of Justice in a recent case ruled that this dutyrequired \u2018serious endeavours\u2019 and \u2018targeted action\u2019;23\u2013 Article 3 of the Birds Directive and Article 10 of the Habitats Directive both set outrequirements for the creation or restoration of habitat where this will contribute to theconservation of the habitat or species. Both of these duties are obviously flexible enoughto apply to \u2018moving\u2019 habitats in response to climate change. Article 3 of the Birds Directiveis particularly well placed to tackle the problems posed by climate change by helping tobuild the resilience of existing protected areas, accommodate change and create new habitatthrough the provision of new sites. It is not appropriate for a Member State to wait until anactual reduction in population occurs or any risk of a protected species becoming extinctmaterialises before Article 3 kicks in. Such measures must be in place before these thingsoccur.24Integrating these elements into a package of site protection, habitat creation and managementmeasures for species and habitats will be essential in making sure there is a coherent response.Such an approach has already been proposed in the UK for breeding bittern Botaurus stellaris,a rare heron concentrated in a series of SPAs on the Suffolk coast and highly vulnerable to sealevel rise, incorporating the compensatory reedbed referred to above.25, 264. ConclusionWe believe our analysis supports a general conclusion that climate change adaptation will requirethe interpretation and implementation of the Nature Directives to be further developed, but thattheir fundamental construction is as sound today as it was when they were adopted. They canembrace the dynamic response to climate change sought by Cliquet et al. and other commenta-tors.There is a clear risk that the natural environment will lose out through climate change inat least three ways: not only to direct loss through changing climate space, but also indirectly,through competition for scarce resources such as water, and projects undertaken to mitigate oradapt to the effects of climate change such as renewable energy projects, reservoirs and intensifi-cation of land use for agricultural and bioenergy crops.The health of our wildlife in general, and protected areas in particular, is a tangibleindicator of the health of the ecosystem functions underlying them. As the UK SustainableDevelopment Commission noted in its work on tidal energy generation, the Nature Directivesrepresent an \u2018enlightened approach to dealing with environmental constraints, and one that is atthe heart of sustainable development\u2019.27Response to \u2018Protected areas and climate change \u2013 Reflections from a practitioner\u2019s perspective'* Prof. Dr An Cliquet, Department of Public International Law, Ghent University, Ghent (Belgium); Prof. Dr Jim Harris, Department of NaturalResources, School of Applied Sciences, Cranfield University, Cranfield (UK); Dr Peter Howsam, Department of Natural Resources, Schoolof Applied Sciences, Cranfield University, Cranfield (UK); Prof. Dr Chris Backes, Department of Public Law, Maastricht University,Maastricht (the Netherlands).

Legal challenges for protectedareas\u2019 (Cliquet et al., 20091). The reflections by Dodd et al. emphasize and confirm our mainconclusions. After careful reading, even where there seems to be a different viewpoint on somepoints, there is little which is actually contradictory.In summary, Cliquet et al. point out that in order to face the additional challenges ofclimate change, more nature conservation efforts will be necessary. Ecosystems must be mademore resilient, by enhancing the core areas of the ecological network and increasing efforts atconnectivity. This should inter alia enable efforts to sustain species that are forced to migratebecause of climate change. This requires a certain degree of \u2018flexibility\u2019, in the sense thatadditional areas will need to be protected, existing areas will have to be enhanced, the coherencebetween the core areas should be improved and connectivity between protected areas should besubstantially increased. It should again be stressed that \u2018flexibility\u2019 means to do more, not less\u2013 more sites, bigger areas! The Birds and Habitats Directives provide at least some scope forfacing the challenges ahead2 (although not as explicitly as would seem ideal from both anecological and legal-technical point of view). The main problem is that so far the application andinterpretation of both Directives have taken place with a rather \u2018static\u2019 approach, which mightconflict with the natural or man-made dynamics of nature.Dodd et al. support these findings and confirm the need for a more flexible approach, butdisagree with our conclusion that the Directives are static by protecting the \u2018existing values\u2019 ofprotected areas. Dodd et al. see our analysis as a rather narrow reading of the Directives,emphasizing the site-protection elements of both Directives. We did indeed focus mostly on theprotected sites, as most efforts so far by Member States have concentrated on the designation ofthe Natura 2000 sites. We also agree with the point made that existing designations have had apositive impact both for the specific species and habitats, but also as a secondary consequencefor the wider ecosystem within or associated with a designated site. We completely agree withthe statement by Dodd et al. that there has been a general failure to consider protected areas aspart of an integrated package of measures that the Nature Directives require to deliver theoverarching objective of obtaining a favourable conservation status.In sum, both articles confirm that the Directives provide possibilities to face the challengesahead but, so far, implementation has been insufficient. The core question that remains is howdo we proceed in the future? Is it sufficient to implement the Directives in a more integrated wayAN CLIQUET, JIM HARRIS, PETER HOWSAM & CHRIS BACKES3 See also J.

Special Report, European Environmental Bureau, December 2008.150and to implement certain provisions that have so far been neglected (such as Articles 3 and 10on connectivity)? Or are additional measures required?We can agree with Dodd et al. that the Directives provide us with the necessary tools forthe challenges that we face, at least in the short term. Stronger efforts towards a more proactiveimplementation will be necessary, amongst others a continuous process of designating sites,formulating and readapting conservation objectives, allowing for ecosystem functioning andecological processes and taking measures aiming at connectivity. It will be the task of theMember States, and of the Commission and Court to supervise this process. Such a proactiveimplementation is necessary in order to reduce the loss of biodiversity in the short term. The rigid interpretation that is sometimes given to the Directives is often driven by the needfor legal certainty for stakeholders. A proactive implementation of the Directives, throughbuilding a more robust and coherent network, as well as proactive species protection, can leadto a more favourable status for conservation. This is also in the interest of stakeholders. Robustnetworks in which habitats and species have a favourable status of conservation are less vulnera-ble to human activities. For the implementation of the existing Directives, we would like to stress two items: firstly,much more effort is needed for ecological restoration,3 both within and outside the Natura 2000sites, as the status of many habitats and species is unfavourable.4 This is also clear from thefailure in the EU to halt the loss of biodiversity by 2010. A recent study by Ray Benayas et al.(2009) has demonstrated the success of restoration programmes in securing enhanced ecosystemservices over their formerly degraded status.5 Secondly, more efforts are needed for realizingconnectivity (building a \u2018green infrastructure\u2019 for Europe6). As stated in Cliquet et al., theprovisions on connectivity in the Habitats Directive are rather weak. In a first instance theCommission will have to undertake a more stringent approach to supervising implementation byMember States. As Dodd et al. point out, obtaining a favourable conservation status is anoverarching objective of the Nature Directives. In order to attain this objective, measures outsideprotected areas are required, such as connectivity measures and overall species protectionmeasures (based on Article 12 of the Habitats Directive).In the longer term, additional legal instruments might prove useful. The idea of an \u2018Ecosys-tem Services Directive\u2019 was briefly explored in Cliquet et al. Rather than replacing the NatureDirectives, this could apply horizontally on the whole territory, and not only within the coreprotected areas, but especially outside those core areas. This could lead to a better legal founda-tion for inter alia connectivity measures and monitoring obligations. Especially areas outside thecurrent protected network, which could be important such as future corridors, receptors formigrating species and producers of ecosystems services could be brought under the protectionof such a Directive. As stated in Cliquet et al., more research must be carried out to study in moredetail the possible contents as well as the benefits of such a legal instrument, and its relation tothe Nature Directives, as well as other instruments such as the Water Framework Directive, butalso its relation to policy areas such as agricultural and transport policies.",

With international scienti\ufb01c evidence mounting and the reliability offuture climate predictions increasing, in 2002 English Heritage commissionedresearch to gather evidence on climate change as a possible cause ofenvironmental instability of cultural heritage and to inform present and futureplanning (Cassar 2005).Climate change modelling and predictionClimate change predictions are based on climate models which are constructedfrom studies of the current climate system, including atmosphere, ocean, landsurface, cryosphere and biosphere, and the factors that in\ufb02uence it such asgreenhouse gas emissions and future socio-economic patterns of land use. A climatemodel is a mathematical formulation of the effects of all the key processes operatingin the climate system and the effectiveness of any particular model is assessed byseeing how well it reproduces past climate behaviour. Additionally, extrapolatingthe models to future climates incorporates not only the scienti\ufb01c uncertaintiesinherent in modelling complex weather systems, it implies that the broad operationof the climate system will remain constant and not undergo dramatic shifts and themuch less quanti\ufb01able uncertainties in future emissions and land use. Advancedglobal models typically have a coarse resolution (a few hundred kilometres) whichdoes not allow for useful local climate change projections where local weather isheavily in\ufb02uenced by local topography and land use.More detailed regional climate models (RCMs) are constructed for limitedareas and shorter time periods. The United Kingdom\u2019s Meteorological Of\ufb01cesupports the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research, which hasseveral such regional climate models. This study used the UKCIP02 projections(Hulme et al. 2002) from the output of the regional climate model, HadRM3whose resolution is 50 km over Europe, with the model run over the periods1961\u201390 and 2070\u201399 for a range of emission scenarios. The con\ufb01dence levels inthe key predictions are qualitative because they are based on expert understandingof complex science, observed data, the ability to predict and the consistency ofthe model (Table 1).Focussing on the high con\ufb01dence projections for 2080, the United Kingdomis likely to experience a rise in temperature, an increase in variability leading tosome very warm years, and an increase in wetter winters everywhere; greatercontrast between summer and winter seasons and a decrease in soil moisturelevels in summer and autumn in southeast England; increased regional differencesin sea level rises and a signi\ufb01cant decrease in snowfalls everywhere.To manage a wide array of climatic variables and heritage types in an integratedresearch project is a huge challenge. A decision was made to concentrate on twospeci\ufb01c contrasting regions, the northwest and the southeast of England. Bothhad already been extensively studied by Cran\ufb01eld University\u2019s RegIS project(Holman et al. 2001) which was the only published integrated assessment ofclimate change impacts in the UK and was therefore of unique importance.610 PUBLISHED IN THE 14TH TRIENNIAL MEETING THE HAGUE PREPRINTS VOL IIAbstractThis paper presents the \ufb01rst broad-based research on the impact of climatechange on historic buildings, buriedarchaeology, parks and gardens.Research coincided with thepublication of the UKCIP02 climatechange scenarios and other studiesassessing regional climate change andthe impact on nature conservation andgardens.

Themethodology made empirical evidence more robust by cross-checking differenttypes of data.Project teamworkA multidisciplinary team of investigators was assembled including conservators,building physicists, archaeologists and a climate modeller.1 The widest possiblelist of likely climate-related problems for cultural heritage was brought together,the UKCIP02 climate change scenarios (Hulme et al. 2002) were evaluated andthe variables most likely to impact on cultural heritage in the two study areaswere selected.QuestionnaireThe purpose of the questionnaire was to gather data but also to be an informationsource for the recipients. It was constructed around 18 central questions, one foreach issue of concern identi\ufb01ed by the project team, namely seasonal and diurnaltemperature changes, seasonal and extreme rainfall, sea level rise, storm surge,river \ufb02ooding, water runoff and erosion, soil moisture content, water table heightand chemistry, relative humidity, wind, solar radiation and cloud cover, lightningand \ufb01re risk, plant physiology and distribution, pest and diseases, human comfortand health and safety. Each question was accompanied by a text synopsis of theclimate change impact projected for that issue, using predictions from theUKCIP02 climate change scenarios (Hulme et al. 2002) and the RegIS project(Holman et al. 2001) and comparing the projections for 2080 with the baselineTable 1.

Thequestionnaire was circulated widely to national, regional and local scienti\ufb01c andheritage experts, and local site managers requesting evidence of links betweenclimate change and its impact on cultural heritage, the likely future effect onheritage of current climate change predictions and the planning and preparationthat would be needed to ensure a timely management response.Site visitsThe questionnaire was followed by visits to 17 buildings, archaeological sites,parks and gardens with contrasting climates, \ufb02ood risk, accessibility, urbanization,types of buildings, archaeology and gardens.2 The choice was made inconsultation with regional and local heritage experts, managers, advisers andcustodians. The visits were intended to see and hear at \ufb01rst hand the climatechange threats to the sites, to examine examples of damage attributed to climatechange and to discuss how these were impacting on local stewardship decisions.Regional workshopsTwo regional workshops were organized in Cambridge and Manchester,representing two areas affected differently by climate change. Regional expertsand managers discussed the questionnaire and site visit data, future protectionplans and likely con\ufb02ict over the different ways in which heritage might respondto climate change. On the basis of the cross-referred evidence from thequestionnaire, site visits and workshops, the original list of climate-relatedproblems was distilled into \ufb01ve issues central to the cultural heritage, namely:temperature (maximum temperatures rising markedly); soil moisture (levelsdropping markedly and summer drought); extreme rainfall and high winds(torrential rainfall becoming common and damaging winds probably becomingcommon); river \ufb02ooding (\ufb02oods increasing in frequency and severity); and coastal\ufb02ooding (sea levels rises and storm surge exacerbating coastal \ufb02ooding and loss).Policy makers\u2019 workshopA policy makers\u2019 workshop met to discuss and prioritize the \ufb01ve issues. Mapsoverlaid the locations of vulnerable sites and their susceptibility to patterns oflocal climate change produced from regional climate models (Cassar 2005). Theyhelped make complex risk data accessible and provided a direct and effectivemeans of perceiving the overall scale of climate change problems and the risks toindividual sites (Figures 1 and 2). The policy makers\u2019 workshop distilled severalrecommendations as well as some general conclusions on how cultural heritagecould adapt to a changing climate.Evidence of threat and observed changes to cultural heritageThis evidence was based on speci\ufb01c observations by heritage managers of changesattributed to climate change and on experience, knowledge and understanding ofthe sites in their care. The climate change factors identi\ufb01ed as the greatest threatto cultural heritage were reached by consensus and almost all heritage managershad already noticed progressive changes in the climate patterns of their sites andassociated increases in deterioration.Buildings and their contentsThe inability of historic rainwater disposal systems to handle torrential or wind-driven rain was highlighted as a contributory factor in the wetting of walls. Solarradiation drives moisture and salts inside walls leading to damp and the risk ofef\ufb02orescence on internal surfaces. The problems of river \ufb02ooding necessitatingextensive repairs to buildings and the risk of disturbance to buried archaeology ofimprovements to drainage systems to cope with \ufb02ood risks were emphasized.Audley End House, a historic property with gardens in south east England, was612 ICOM COMMITTEE FOR CONSERVATION, 2005 VOL IIhighlighted as an example where there have been problems with rainwaterdisposal, damp penetration, damage to decorative plasterwork and river \ufb02oodingof the gardens. Although the UKCIP02 climate change scenarios have a lowcon\ufb01dence level for predictions of storminess and high winds, these issues were\ufb02agged up as problems already being experienced with historic roofs, windows,awnings, verandas, large trees close to buildings, ruins and excavated archaeology.The high con\ufb01dence level predicting a decrease in soil moisture levels also putsbuildings at risk from subsidence. The increased erosion of the ruins of FurnessAbbey on the Cumbrian peninsula in the northwest of England was linked towind throw, increased storminess and gales, whereas coastal loss in south eastEngland continues to affect the medieval town of Dunwich, which has virtuallydisappeared into the sea. Predicted changes in temperature and relative humiditywere considered to be small and gradual enough for vulnerable materials toaccommodate them. However, concern was expressed over the indirect futureeffect of these changes, namely increased demand for mechanical cooling insummer, requiring meticulous environmental monitoring of conditions and a setof baseline values. Evidence of the change in distribution of existing pest speciesacross the United Kingdom and the introduction of new pest species suggest thatisolated opportunities alone cannot account for these changes in the past decade.Buried archaeologyChanges in soil moisture and chemistry were unanimously considered a threat topreservation in situ as baseline knowledge of the effect of changes in soilchemistry on preservation is poorly understood, for example the loss of certaindata types only preserved in waterlogged/anaerobic/anoxic conditions, the loss ofarchaeology presently preserved close of the ground surface and the effect on thearchaeological record of the drying of soil causing the loss of stratigraphicintegrity. The increase in sea level and storminess is a danger for many sitesvulnerable to erosion such as the Sutton Hoo barrow site because of thedisturbance of the metastable equilibrium between artifacts and soil. On the otherVOL II Preventive conservation 613Figure 1. UKCIP02 high con\ufb01dence prediction of torrential rain inthe east of England superimposed on visited sitesFigure 2. UKCIP02 high con\ufb01dence prediction of torrential rain inthe northwest of England superimposed on visited siteshand, in areas that lie below sea level, such as the Fenland area in south eastEngland where many prehistoric and Roman fenland sites were built and decayedunder tidal in\ufb02uence, \ufb02ood risk alleviation schemes could cause more damage toburied archaeology than \ufb02ooding, though the occurrence of torrential rain wouldcause erosion. Changes in plant physiology and distribution were of concern fora variety of reasons: drought causing loss of vegetation exacerbating erosion, deeproot penetration damaging structures causing subsidence and sediment boundariesand changes in vegetation cover affecting the survival of artifacts and ecofacts.Parks and gardensThe effect of climate change on parks and gardens has been documentedelsewhere (Bisgrove and Hadley 2002). The evidence from this researchcon\ufb01rmed that many factors that affect buildings and archaeology also affecthistoric parks and gardens. Wind and rainfall are a key concern. Mature treespecimens are particularly susceptible to wind damage. Storms have alreadydamaged or destroyed many historic landscapes, but there is concern that in thefuture climate change can make identical replacements dif\ufb01cult to grow.Excessive rainfall has caused trees to become unstable and to topple during gales,while the planting that can cope successfully with dry summer conditions is at riskfrom waterlogged soils in winter. The predicted rise in temperature could see adramatic change in the appearance of the English landscape where daffodils andapples need frost to germinate or set seed. Warmer temperatures have alreadyincreased the risk from pests such as the year-round presence of Canada geese atBirkenhead Park in northwest England destroying grassed areas. Changes in thechemistry and height of water tables would affect water supplies to ornamentallakes, fountains and other water features, whereas the after-effects of high tidesand river \ufb02ooding can be exacerbated by salinity of the \ufb02ood water as for exampleat Westbury Court Garden on the River Severn in the west of England whereyew hedges hundreds of years old are at risk.Strategies for adapting cultural heritage to climate changePlanning time-scalesConvincing policy makers to include climate change impacts in planning andmoreover cultural heritage can be dif\ufb01cult. The questionnaire revealed, and theworkshops con\ufb01rmed, that planning time-scales in the heritage sector are oftenmuch longer than conventional planning cycles (Figure 3).Out of 57 questionnaire respondents, only 13 indicated a planning timeframeof \ufb01ve years, whereas 21 respondents indicated a timeframe of over 100 years.This \u2018long view\u2019 is vindicated by the emphasis on preparation and adaptation inthe Third Assessment Report of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on614 ICOM COMMITTEE FOR CONSERVATION, 2005 VOL II050 15 10 25 20 0 1 > 0 0 1 - 1 5 0 5 - 6 2 5 2 - 1 1 0 1 - 6 5 - 0s r a e y   n inumber of responsesFigure 3. Heritage managers\u2019 questionnaire responses on planning time-scalesClimate Change (McCarthy et al. 2001) which advises policy makers thatadaptation is a necessary strategy at all scales to complement climate changemitigation efforts and that \u2018Adaptation has the potential to reduce adverse impacts ofclimate change and to enhance bene\ufb01cial impacts, but will incur costs and will not preventall damages\u2019. Heritage professionals can make a positive contribution to longer-term planning for climate change by other authorities, can ensure that culturalheritage is integrated into these plans and more speci\ufb01cally in conservation plansdirectly affecting cultural heritage. However, caution must be exercised ascon\ufb01dence in longer-term predictions is lower overall than short-termpredictions.Monitoring, management and maintenanceThe research did not reveal new problems for cultural heritage but it drewattention to long standing conservation issues. Maintenance and conditionmonitoring will become more critical as climate change takes effect. Where thereis concern that drainage and rainwater disposal systems in historic buildings maynot have the capacity to deal with torrential rain, it will be important to keep allgutters, hoppers and down pipes, even the most dif\ufb01cult and inaccessible,meticulously clean so that an increase in rainfall can \ufb02ow away safely. Crucially,there was consensus among heritage experts and managers that non-invasive orconcealed improvements might not be possible, requiring dif\ufb01cult choices onwhat to sacri\ufb01ce and a preference for funding to be directed towards maintenanceinstead of new building work.Loss and obsolescenceThe issue of acceptance of loss of some heritage elements to save the rest wasraised in the context of coastal archaeological sites. One heritage manager stated:\u2018We\u2019ll never save everything, so hard decisions are needed as to which to let go\u2019 with anemphasis on assessments of value, signi\ufb01cance and life expectancy. There was adifferent view from some stewards of the natural environment with measuresbeing taken to reverse the loss of natural habitats by reinstating salt marshes insouth east England. The question of environmental obsolescence was raised forageing buildings that will need adapting to survive climate change and to remainrelevant to modern use. As the historic building fabric interacts with rather thanexcludes moisture, the issue that needs addressing is whether there might ever besound environmental reasons for demolition.Policy actionsIn conclusion, several key policy recommendations emerged from the research toindicate the way forward for understanding the impact of climate change oncultural heritage.CooperationThe different strands of cultural heritage need to cooperate, share informationand speak with unity on the issue of climate change and that there are bene\ufb01tsfrom integration with the natural environment. Cultural heritage cannot standalone and that common concerns are an opportunity for cross-disciplinarycooperation.FundingMaintenance emerged as a key concern, necessitating a more equitable balancebetween funding for repair and maintenance, tax incentives for sustainablemaintenance, the formation of partnerships with other interested parties such asthe insurance industry and support for skills training for upgrading, repairing andmaintaining cultural heritage.VOL II Preventive conservation 615ResearchThe lack of good data on the effects of environmental change and the lack ofunderstanding of the behaviour of the materials worsening with the shift ofclimate goal posts was a signi\ufb01cant issue. Research is needed on monitoringchange and developing appropriate sustainability indicators, with outputs beingused to drive policy, develop strategies and disseminate knowledge andawareness.EducationThe public needs educating on the impact of climate change on cultural heritageand on the importance of cultural heritage as a climate change indicator. At alocal level, site logbooks are needed to record impacts of climate change as partof the implementation of conservation plans. At an international level, amechanism for sharing knowledge and experience would enable information,resources and good examples of adaptation to be shared.AcknowledgementWe thank English Heritage Archaeology Commissions for funding this research.Notes1 The researchers were: Professor May Cassar and Dr Robyn Pender (conservators);Professor Bill Bordass, Professor Tadj Oreszczyn and Professor Philip Steadman(building physicists); Jane Corcoran and Taryn Nixon (archaeologists); and ProfessorLord Julian Hunt (climate modeller).2  Southeast England sites: Audley End House and gardens, Dunwich medieval town,Flag Fen Bronze Age wetlands site, Languard Fort 19th century forti\ufb01cation andSutton Hoo barrow site.

These strategies to make \nthe Netherlands climate-proof will also have its impact on nature and ecosystem functioning, in \naddition to the direct impacts of climate change. This report provides a state-of-the-art review of \nnational and international research with respect to climate change impacts and adaptation, relevant to \nnatural ecosystems in the Netherlands. This review is intended to serve as a reference of current \navailable knowledge and will assist in programming new research required for climate-proofing the \nNetherlands. \n \nNatural ecosystems, including semi-natural ecosystems, which can be found in Dutch nature \nreserves, provide habitats for plant and animal species including legally protected species. In addition, \nnatural ecosystems deliver ecosystem services, such as protection against flooding, and carbon \nsequestration. Climatic changes (temperature increase, changing patterns of precipitation, and sea \nlevel rise) will likely affect ecosystem functioning. This will have consequences for the possibilities to \nachieve policy goals related to biodiversity, for ecosystem services, and for the management of nature \nreserves. \n \nThe effects of separate climatic changes on ecosystem processes and species composition have \nbeen relatively well studied in an international context. Global warming will shift species\u201f ranges \npoleward, may cause mismatches in foodwebs, will likely increase plant productivity and will increase \nevapotranspiration leading to increased drought stress in summer. Elevated atmospheric CO2, \nhowever, will reduce plant transpiration rates and ameliorate drought stress. \n \nLess evidence exists for the effects of changing precipitation patterns, with the exception of the effects \nof flooding. Possible increased occurrence of severe summer drought may reduce plant productivity, \ntrigger shifts in species composition and increase the risks of wild fires, insect outbreaks and \ninvasions by exotic species. Increased flooding is expected because of increased winter precipitation \nand extreme rain events in summer. Moreover, deliberate flooding will be accommodated in \ndesignated water retention or water storage areas as adaptation to prevent flooding of vulnerable \nareas. Research in this context has shown that flooding strongly increases nutrient availability, likely \nresulting in reductions of species richness. \n \nStill far from clear is the integrated picture of how ecosystems will change due to climate change and \nadaptation. We do not know what the net effect of climatic changes combined with high CO2 \nconcentrations is on site conditions such as soil moisture and nutrient availability which determine the \ncompetitive relations between plant species. This also affects animal species whose habitats are \ndependent on the vegetation composition. \n \nIn order to reduce the vulnerability of natural ecosystems to the impacts of climate change, adaptation \nstrategies have been proposed. A primary adaptation strategy to climate change is to reduce and \nmanage the other stresses on species and ecosystems, such as habitat fragmentation and \neutrophication. In the Netherlands, focus is on reducing habitat fragmentation by increasing \nconnectivity of the Dutch National Ecological Network and European Natura 2000 areas to facilitate \nnorthward movement of species. More room for natural landscape-forming processes, such as \nerosion and sedimentation processes along rivers, in estuaries and dune landscapes is another \noption. These \u201cNatural climate buffers\u201d are assumed to combine flood protection with more \nspontaneous and diverse nature. Thirdly, nature policy needs to be made climate-proof by introducing \ndynamic targets instead of conservation of static target species and habitat types in nature policy \nobjectives. \n \nCurrent research in the Netherlands is mostly related to adaptation of the \u201cNational Ecological \nNetwork\u201d, and to multifunctional adaptation (\u201cRoom for the River\u201d, \u201cNatural Climate Buffers\u201d), which \noften combines nature development with flood protection. In addition to research on adaptation, there \nis research on the development of indicators (species) for monitoring climate change effects, \nsearching for species traits that determine vulnerability to climate change, dispersal of species, and \ndevelopment of models to predict the changes in vegetation and ecosystems of the Netherlands due \nto climate change.  \n \n KfC 009/09  \n8 \nKey uncertainties relate to the integrated long-term effects of climatic changes on whole ecosystems \nincluding abiotic site conditions and stochastic events like wild fires and pest outbreaks. Such \nknowledge is required to formulate adaptation strategies for the management of Dutch nature \nreserves. Therefore research priorities include: \n\uf0b7 What is the net effect of expected climatic changes including atmospheric CO2 on site conditions \nrelevant to ecosystem functioning? \n\uf0b7 What are the impacts of extreme weather events? \n\uf0b7 Which types of species and ecosystems are most sensitive to the impacts of climate change? \n\uf0b7 Where do adaptation measures for other sectors (water security) conflict with biodiversity targets? \n \n \nClimate change impacts on natural ecosystems   \n 9 \nSamenvatting \n \nKlimaatverandering is onvermijdbaar geworden en Nederland is dan ook begonnen met het \naanpassen van de watersystemen en de kustverdediging om de kwetsbaarheid ten aanzien van \nklimaatverandering te verminderen. Deze adaptatiestrategie\u00ebn om Nederland klimaatbestendig te \nmaken zullen gevolgen hebben voor de aanwezige natuur, bovenop de directe gevolgen van \nklimaatverandering. Dit rapport geeft een overzicht van het voor Nederlandse natuur relevante \nnationale en internationale onderzoek naar de gevolgen van klimaatverandering en adaptatie. Dit \noverzicht van beschikbare wetenschappelijke kennis draagt bij aan het programmeren van nieuw \nonderzoek door de stichting Kennis voor Klimaat. \n \nEcosystemen in Nederlandse natuurgebieden voorzien in habitats voor plant en diersoorten, inclusief \nde wettelijk beschermde soorten. Daarnaast leveren ecosystemen zogenaamde ecosysteemdiensten \nzoals bescherming tegen overstroming en het vastleggen van koolstof. Veranderingen in het klimaat \n(toename temperaturen, veranderingen in neerslagpatronen en zeespiegelstijging) zullen effect \nhebben op het functioneren van ecosystemen. Dit heeft gevolgen voor de mogelijkheden om \nbeleidsdoelstellingen ten aanzien van biodiversiteit te halen, voor ecosysteemdiensten en voor het \nbeheer van natuurgebieden. \n \nDe afzonderlijke effecten van een warmer klimaat en toenemende concentraties CO2 in de lucht zijn \nal uitgebreid aan bod gekomen in het internationale onderzoek. Aangetoond is dat toenemende \ntemperaturen als gevolg hebben dat arealen van soorten naar het noorden opschuiven, dat in \nvoedselketens mismatches kunnen ontstaan, dat de productiviteit van de vegetatie toeneemt en dat \nde evapotranspiratie toeneemt waarmee \u201fs zomers droogtestress kan ontstaan. Daar staat tegenover \ndat tegelijkertijd toenemende CO2-concentraties zorgen voor een afname van transpiratie en \ndaarmee een verminderde kans op droogtestress. \n \nVeel minder aandacht is er geweest voor de gevolgen van veranderende neerslagpatronen, met \nuitzondering van de gevolgen van overstroming. De mogelijke toename van droge zomers kan leiden \ntot verminderde productiviteit van ecosystemen, veranderingen in soortensamenstelling, en vergrote \nkans op natuurbranden, insectenplagen en invasies van exoten. Een toename van overstromingen \nwordt verwacht vanwege toenemende neerslag \u201fs winters en extremere buien \u201fs zomers. Daarnaast \nzal overstroming plaatsvinden in speciaal daarvoor ingerichte waterbergingsgebieden als \nadaptatiemaatregel om overstroming van meer kwetsbare gebieden te voorkomen. Onderzoek in dit \nkader laat zien dat overstroming kan leiden tot sterke eutrofiering met negatieve consequenties voor \nde biodiversiteit. \n \nHet is nog verre van duidelijk wat de overall effecten van klimaatverandering op de Nederlandse \nnatuur zijn. Zo weten we niet wat het gecombineerde effect is van klimaatsveranderingen en \ntoenemende CO2 concentraties op standplaatsfactoren als bodemvocht en \nnutri\u00ebntenbeschikbaarheid die de concurrentieverhoudingen tussen plantensoorten bepalen. Dit heeft \nook gevolgen voor diersoorten die aan habitats met een bepaalde vegetatiesamenstelling gebonden \nzijn. \n \nOm de gevolgen van klimaatverandering voor natuur te beperken, worden er adaptatiestrategie\u00ebn \nvoorgesteld. Een generieke adaptatiestrategie is om andere stressfactoren, zoals versnippering en \neutrofiering, te verminderen om zodoende de veerkracht van ecosystemen om klimaatverandering te \nkunnen doorstaan te vergroten. In Nederland bestaat de voornaamste adaptatiestrategie uit het \ntegengaan van versnippering door de samenhang in de Ecologische Hoofdstructuur en het Natura \n2000 netwerk te vergroten om daarmee het verschuiven van soortsarealen te faciliteren. Meer ruimte \nvoor natuurlijke processen, zoals erosie en sedimentatie in het rivieren-, estuarium- en \nduinlandschap, is een andere strategie. Deze \u201cNatuurlijke klimaatbuffers\u201d combineren bescherming \ntegen overstroming met spontane en soortenrijke natuur in ecosystemen met natuurlijke gradi\u00ebnten. \nBelangrijk is ook om het natuurbeleid klimaatbestendig te maken door dynamische natuurdoelen te \ndefini\u00ebren in plaats van de huidige statische natuurdoeltypen en \u2013soorten. \n \nHet huidige onderzoek in Nederland is voornamelijk gekoppeld aan adaptatie van de Ecologische \nhoofdstructuur en aan zogenaamde multifunctionele adaptatie (Ruimte voor de rivier, Natuurlijke \nklimaatbuffers), waarin bescherming tegen overstromingen gecombineerd wordt met \nnatuurontwikkeling. Naast het onderzoek met een directe adaptatiecontext, is er momenteel \n KfC 009/09  \n10 \nonderzoek naar het ontwikkelen van indicatorsoorten om klimaatveranderings-effecten te kunnen \nmonitoren, naar soorteigenschappen die kwetsbaarheid ten aanzien van klimaatverandering bepalen, \nnaar verspreidingssnelheden van soorten, en naar het ontwikkelen van modellen om de \nveranderingen in vegetatie en ecosystemen van Nederland als gevolg van klimaatverandering te \nvoorspellen. \n \nKennisleemtes zijn er met name op ecosysteemniveau ten aanzien van lange termijn effecten van \nklimaatverandering op abiotische standplaatsfactoren en risico\u201fs zoals natuurbranden en \ninsectenplagen die de soortensamenstelling en het functioneren van ecosystemen be\u00efnvloeden. Zulke \nkennis is noodzakelijk om adaptatiestrategie\u00ebn voor het beheer van Nederlandse natuurgebieden te \nkunnen ontwikkelen. Dit heeft geleid tot de volgende onderzoeksprioriteiten: \n\uf0b7 Wat is het gecombineerde effect van klimaatsveranderingen en toenemende CO2 concentraties \nop standplaatsfactoren die relevant zijn voor het functioneren van ecosystemen? \n\uf0b7 Wat zijn de gevolgen van extremen in het klimaat? \n\uf0b7 Wat voor soorten en ecosystemen zijn het meest kwetsbaar ten aanzien van de gevolgen van \nklimaatverandering? \n\uf0b7 Waar ontstaan conflicten tussen adaptatiemaatregelen ten behoeve van andere sectoren \n(watersystemen) en natuurdoelen? \n \nClimate change impacts on natural ecosystems   \n 11 \n1. Introduction \n1.1.  Knowledge for Climate \nThe Earth has warmed by 0.7 degrees over the last 100 years. Most of this is due to the influence of \nhuman activities such as the use of fossil fuels. Measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions are \ninitiated at an international level, though atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations are \ncurrently increasing even more rapidly [Canadell et al., 2007a]. In addition, the time lag effect of the \nclimate system means that, even if emission restrictions are successful, significant climate change is \nunavoidable. It is therefore particularly important that the Netherlands is able to adjust rapidly to the \neffects of climate change, being a densely populated country in a delta area vulnerable to the effects \nof climate change.  \n \nRecently the Delta Committee presented advice on protecting the coast and the entire low lying part \nof the Netherlands against the consequences of climate change [Deltacommissie, 2008]. The twelve \nrecommendations are primarily aimed at protection against flooding and the security of our fresh \nwater supplies, but will certainly interact with agriculture, nature, recreation, landscape, infrastructure \nand energy. Not only climate change itself, but also strategies to make the Netherlands climate proof \nwill have impacts on nature and other functions. \n \nWageningen University and Research Centre and the University of Utrecht have jointly founded the \nKnowledge for Climate Foundation, which has the aim of bringing scientifically founded and practically \nobtained knowledge concerning climate and adaptation into the public arena. Knowledge for Climate \nwill develop an ambitious research programme that aims \u201cTo develop the scientific and applied \nknowledge required for climate-proofing the Netherlands and to create a sustainable knowledge \ninfrastructure for managing climate change.\u201d \n1.2.  Objectives \nBefore programming new research, Knowledge for Climate needs an overview of existing scientific \nand applied research relevant to adaptation to climate change. The objective of this study is to \nproduce a State of the Art review of national and international research with respect to climate change \nimpacts, and adaptation, relevant to natural ecosystems in the Netherlands. This review addresses \nthree topics: 1) impacts of climate change on natural ecosystems, including 2) impacts of adaptation \nmeasures to climate change (mainly aimed at flood protection) on natural ecosystems, and 3) \nadaptation strategies aimed at reducing vulnerability of natural ecosystems to climate change. This \nreport includes a summary of current research in the Netherlands, and identification of key \nuncertainties in current knowledge. This review is intended to serve as a reference of current available \nknowledge for a broad public and will assist in programming new research. \nSeveral reports and other publications already exist on one or two of the three above mentioned \ntopics. This report brings together direct and indirect climate change impacts, through adaptation \nstrategies for climate-proofing water security, on natural ecosystems and the consequences for \nadapting natural ecosystems to these climate change impacts. The emphasis is on ecosystems and a \nbit less on direct impacts on plant or animal species as in other Dutch reports. Ecosystems provide \nservices such as water retention and carbon sequestration. Moreover many plant and animal species \ndepend on specific habitats found in ecosystems. Apart from direct climate change impacts on \nspecies, changes in the functioning of ecosystems may additionally affect species and ecosystem \nservices. This report also includes the effects of elevated CO2, ignored in many other Dutch reports. \nThe term natural ecosystems is used as opposed to agro-ecosystems, which will be treated in a \nseparate state-of-the-art report. The term natural ecosystems in this report includes semi-natural \necosystems, in which management takes place to maintain the vegetation structure. Marine \necosystems were not considered in this study. \n1.3.  Methods \nThis report is mainly based on literature review. An important source of information was the latest, \nfourth, assessment report of working group II of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \n(IPCC). This report provides a synthesis of research on global and regional impacts of climate \nchange, adaptation and vulnerability [IPCC 2007, Fischlin et al., 2007]. The book \u201cGlobal Change and \nTerrestrial Ecosystems\u201d [Canadell et al., 2007b] provided insights from meta-analysis of field \nexperiments in which temperature and/or atmospheric CO2 had been manipulated, an important \n KfC 009/09  \n12 \napproach in getting insight in ecosystem responses to climatic changes. In addition, review articles, \narticles on studies carried out in the Netherlands and Dutch reports were used. \nOn December, 15, 2008 an expert meeting was organized, during which a draft version of this report \nwas presented and discussed. The following experts commented on an earlier version of this report: \n\uf0b7 Prof. Dr. R. Aerts Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam \n\uf0b7 Dr. L.P.M.

Outline of report \nClimatic changes (temperature increase, changing patterns of precipitation, and sea level rise) likely \naffect ecosystem functioning with consequences for the possibilities to achieve policy goals related to \nbiodiversity, for ecosystem services, and for the management of nature reserves (Fig. 1). Ecosystem \nservices are the benefits provided by ecosystems to humans, which contribute to making human life \nboth possible and worth living [Diaz et al., 2006]. Examples of ecosystem services are: regulation of \nwater quantity and quality, provision of habitat, resistance to invasive organisms, regulation of climatic \nconditions, and protection against natural hazards. Most of these services depend on ecosystem \nprocesses such as productivity, nutrient cycling and evapotranspiration [Diaz et al., 2006]. \nEcosystem functioning, as described by species composition, disturbances such as invasive species, \nplant productivity and abiotic conditions related to nutrient availability, soil moisture or water regime \nand salinity, is central in this report. This report does not give an overview of all factors that influence \necosystem functioning, it is restricted to the impacts of increasing temperatures, changes in \nprecipitation patterns, sea level rise and elevated atmospheric CO2 on ecosystem functioning and only \nmentions other factors like atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition, when they are interacting with the \neffects of climatic changes. \n \nFigure 1. Diagram of climatic changes impacting on ecosystem functioning with \nconsequences for biodiversity, ecosystem services and target species. Other global changes \nare also included as they are strongly related to climatic changes or interact with climatic \nchanges. Concurrently with climatic and other global changes, management of water systems \nand nature reserves is changing as an adaptation to the anticipated impacts of climatic \nchanges, with intended and unintended impacts on ecosystem functioning. Note that the \nimpacts of nitrogen deposition, and adaptation strategies are only described when they \ninteract with the impacts of climatic changes. \n \nThe general impacts of increasing temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, sea level rise and \nincreasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations, relevant to ecosystems in the Netherlands, based on \ninternational literature, are described in chapter 2. Chapter 3 gives an overview of adaptation \nstrategies that have been proposed to reduce the vulnerability of natural ecosystems in the \nNetherlands to the impacts of climate change. Current research on impacts and adaptation is \nsummarized in chapter 4, followed by identification of key uncertainties in current knowledge and \nresearch priorities. \nAdaptation Other global changes Climatic changes \nTemperature Precipitation Sea level rise Atmospheric \nCO2 \nNitrogen \ndeposition \nWater \nmanagement \nNature \nmanagement \nEcosystem functioning \nSpecies \ncomposition \nInvading \nspecies \nPlant \nproductivity \nNutrient \navailability \nWater regime/ \nSoil moisture \nSalinity \nNature policy/management goals \nEcosystem services Target species Biodiversity \n KfC 009/09  \n14 \n \nClimate change impacts on natural ecosystems   \n 15 \n2.  Impacts \n2.1.  Climate change in the Netherlands \nBefore reviewing the impacts of climate change on natural ecosystems, climate change in the \nNetherlands for the past century and as anticipated for the current century needs to be briefly \ndescribed in order to put the results from research on climate change impacts into perspective. Since \n1900, the Netherlands has seen a temperature rise of 1.2 \u00b0C, which is more than the global \ntemperature increase of 0.8 \u00b0C [KNMI, 2006]. Climate warming was most pronounced in the past two \ndecades, as illustrated by the fact that the top ten of warmest years were all after 1988. The years \n2006 and 2007 were the warmest years since the start of systematic temperature measurements in \n1706 [KNMI, 2008]. Annual precipitation increased by 18%, with largest increases in autumn and \nwinter, and smallest increase in summer. No trend in extreme precipitation was noticed. Average sea \nlevel rise was 2 mm per year. Soil subsidence was 0-4 mm per year. \nFor the 21\nst\n century, KNMI developed 4 climate change scenarios for the Netherlands. These 4 \nscenarios have been derived from assumptions on global climate warming (+ 1 \u00b0C or + 2 \u00b0C in 2050 \nrelative to 1990) combined with assumptions on changes in regional air circulation patterns (change \nor no change) (Table 1). The four scenarios agree on: continued warming, more precipitation in \nwinter, extreme rain events become more extreme, and sea level rise. Differences between the \nscenarios, which should be seen as equally likely to occur, can be found in: degree of temperature \nrise: 0.9-2.8 \u00b0C in 2050, precipitation increase or decrease in summer, degree of sea level rise: 15-35 \ncm in 2050, and 35-85 cm in 2100, all relative to 1990. Based on very recent scientific insights, the \nDelta Committee puts the upper limit of regional sea level rise at 130 cm in 2100. This includes the \neffect of land subsidence. \n \nTable 1. Climate change in the Netherlands in 2050 relative to 1990 according to four KNMI\u201906 \nclimate change scenarios [KNMI, 2006]. \n G G+ W W+ \nGlobal temperature increase in 2050 + 1 \u00b0C + 1 \u00b0C + 2 \u00b0C + 2 \u00b0C \nChange of air circulation pattern no yes no yes \nWinter average temperature \naverage precipitation \nextreme precipitation \n+ 0.9 \u00b0C \n+ 4 % \n+ 4 % \n+ 1.1 \u00b0C \n+ 7 % \n+ 6 % \n+ 1.8 \u00b0C \n+ 7 % \n+ 8 % \n+ 2.3 \u00b0C \n+ 14 % \n+ 12 % \nSummer average temperature \naverage precipitation \nextreme precipitation \npotential evaporation \n+ 0.9 \u00b0C \n+ 3 % \n+ 13 % \n+ 3 % \n+ 1.4 \u00b0C \n\u2212 10 % \n+ 5 % \n+ 8 % \n+ 1.7 \u00b0C \n+ 6 % \n+ 27 % \n+ 7 % \n+ 2.8 \u00b0C \n\u2212 19 % \n+ 10 % \n+ 15 % \nSea level absolute rise 15-25 cm 15-25 cm 20-35 cm 20-35 cm \n \nThe projected temperature increase and changed precipitation patterns are expected to result in \nlarger dynamics in river flows, i.e. decreased summer flow and increased winter flow. With rising sea \nwater level and reduced river discharges in summer, it is expected that salt water will penetrate further \ninland via groundwater and rivers that are not closed off from the sea, with salinization of water \nresources as a consequence. \n KfC 009/09  \n16 \n2.2.  Impacts of increasing temperatures \n2.2.1.  Ecosystem processes \nTemperature affects all biological processes. Therefore, temperature is a key regulator of many \necosystem processes, such as soil respiration, litter decomposition, nitrogen mineralization and \nnitrification, denitrification, methane emission, fine root dynamics, plant productivity and plant nutrient \nuptake. Ecosystem responses to climate warming have been studied in field experiments in which \ntemperature is manipulated. Meta-analysis of ecosystem warming experiments revealed that \nexperimental warming of 2.4 \u00b0C on average, significantly increased rates of soil respiration by 20%, \nnet N mineralization by 46% and net primary productivity by 19% [Norby et al., 2007]. The response of \nplant productivity may be smaller in the Netherlands as, in this meta-analysis, arctic vegetation was \nmore responsive than forest and grassland ecosystems. These results are consistent with the \nhypothesis that warming directly increases rates of microbial processes, thereby increasing the \navailability of nutrients, and increasing plant productivity, particularly in nutrient-limited ecosystems \nsuch as arctic tundra. The stimulation of plant productivity may also be a direct effect of warming on \nrates of photosynthesis or the result of a warming-induced extension of the growing season. \nIn the Netherlands, experimental warming by ca. 1 \u00b0C of a dry heathland increased aboveground plant \nproductivity, but not in the unusually hot year 2003 when plant productivity was strongly reduced \n[Pe\u00f1uelas et al., 2007]. The warming treatment also increased nutrient availability and increased \nherbivory damage of the heather. As a consequence, grasslands may replace heathlands, reducing \nbiodiversity and decreasing recreational values [Wessel et al., 2004]. Intensification of management \nactivities involving the regular removal of nutrients and vegetation by grazing, sod-cutting, clipping, \nand burning could be used to counteract these climatic effects. \nTemperature also affects the physical process of evapotranspiration. Warmer air has a lower relative \nhumidity, because the maximum water content (at saturation) is larger in warmer air. The lower \nrelative humidity results in larger evaporative water losses with drier soil conditions as a \nconsequence. The KNMI scenarios assume an 8-15% increase in summer potential evaporation in \n2050 when air circulation patterns will change with more frequent dry eastern winds in summer [Van \nden Hurk, 2006]. However, the net effect of warming-induced increases in evaporative water losses \nand CO2-induced water savings by plants on ecosystem evapotranspiration and soil moisture \nconditions will be smaller [Kruijt et al., 2008]. \nIn lakes, rising temperature will generally have negative effects on water quality, because less oxygen \ncan dissolve in warmer water and concentrations of nutrients and toxicants will be higher when \nsummer evaporation increases [Fischlin et al., 2007]. \n2.2.2.  Disturbance \nClimate warming makes it possible for new invasive species to establish in the Netherlands. In the \nabsence of specific natural enemies, these species may cause tree mortality on a large scale [Moraal,  \n2007]. Since its first observation in the south of the Netherlands in 1991, the geographical range of \nthe Oak processionary caterpillar (Thaumetopoea processionea) has increased steadily over the \nyears, moving in north-eastern direction. As the Oak processionary caterpillar is mainly found on the \nsouthern side of solitary oaks, it is likely that it prefers warm conditions and that climate warming has \nbeen the main cause of the spreading in recent decades. This insect pest species is an egg-\noverwintering insect, a group of insect species that as a whole has become increasingly successful \nover the years [Moraal et al., 2004]. The relatively warm and humid winters of the last decades may \nhave reduced winter survival of adult, larval and pupal stages more than of the eggs, presumably \nbecause of increased infections by pathogenic fungi for which the eggs are less vulnerable. In an \necosystem warming experiment, an outbreak of the heather beetle (Lochmaea suturalis) in the \nwarming treatment strongly affected the vegetation response [Van Breemen et al., 1998]. Climate \nwarming may increase viral infections in seals [Oost et al., 2005]. \nFor lakes in the Netherlands, it is expected that toxic blue-green algae blooms may occur more \nfrequently with climate warming. In studies on Dutch lakes, it has been observed that some \ncyanobacteria were more abundant after mild winters than following periods of ice cover, and that \noutbreaks of botulism have occurred mostly in exceptionally warm summers [Mooij et al., 2005]. \nFreshwater lakes are considered to belong to the most vulnerable among different ecosystems to \ninvasions by exotics [Sala et al., 2000]. In the Netherlands, the rate of invasions has been accelerated \nby the interconnection of river basins in Central Europe. Climate warming is expected to support \nbiological invasions into Dutch freshwater systems because most of the invading species originate \nfrom warmer regions in South-East Europe [Mooij et al., 2005]. \n \nClimate change impacts on natural ecosystems   \n 17 \n2.2.3. Species composition \nFrom geological history we can learn that species extinctions have accompanied large climate \nperturbations of the past. Evidence from Pleistocene glaciations indicates that range shifts have been \na major species response [Lovejoy & Hannah, 2005]. Global meta-analyses documented range shifts \naveraging 6.1 km per decade towards the poles [Parmesan & Yohe, 2003]. This is though very \ndifferent for different groups of organisms (plants, microfauna, insects, birds and mammals). The \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) collected almost 29,000 observational data \nseries, from 75 studies, that show significant change in many biological systems (terrestrial, marine, \nand freshwater), of which 89% are consistent with the direction of change expected as a response to \nwarming (IPCC, 2007). This and other findings led to the conclusion with high confidence that \n\u201cAnthropogenic warming over the last three decades has had a discernible influence on many \nphysical and biological systems\u201d.  \n \nFor the Netherlands, there are numerous examples of plant and animal species moving northward \n[MNP, 2005], phenological changes, i.e. changed timing of life cycle events, such as start of flowering, \nleaf-unfolding, butterfly appearance, bird migration, and egg-laying [Van Vliet, 2008], and resulting \nmismatches within foodwebs [Both & Visser, 2001]. Based on 180,000 plant phenological \nobservations, Van Vliet (2008) concluded that the duration of the growing season increased with on \naverage one month since the end of the 1980s. Not only the start of flowering, leaf unfolding and fruit \nripening was on average ten to fifteen days earlier in recent years compared to the period before \n1990, also phenological events in autumn delayed with on average two weeks. The consequences of \nthis extended growing season for plant populations and communities are largely unknown. When \nphenological responses to climate change differ across trophic levels, mismatches within foodwebs \noccur. For the long-distance migrant bird species Ficedula hypoleuca (Bonte vliegenvanger) it has \nbeen shown that it missed the peak in food abundance when returning from Africa as it did not arrive \nearlier at its breeding grounds, while its prey hatched earlier due to climate warming [Both & Visser, \n2001]. This resulted in population declines in areas where the food peaks early in the season [Both et \nal., 2006]. In the Wadden Sea, the mild winters of 1988-1990 strongly reduced the abundance of \nmolluscs leading to dramatic starvation of birds such as Haematopus ostralegus (Scholekster) and \nSomateria mollissima (Eidereend) [Oost et al., 2005]. \n \nExamples of southern species which became more abundant or enriched the Dutch flora and fauna \nare: bird species Alcedo atthis (IJsvogel), Egretta garzetta (Kleine zilverreiger) and Cettia cetti (Cetti\u201fs \nzanger) [SOVON, 2007], plant species Ophrys apifera (Bijenorchis), and insect species Crocothemis \nerythraea (Vuurlibel), Oecanthus pellucens (Boomkrekel) and Argiope bruennichi (Wespspin). Among \nthe numerous expanding southern insect species are plague insect species like Thaumetopoea \nprocessionea (Eikenprocessierups), Cameraria ohridella (Paardenkastanjemineermot), and \nHaemmatoloma dorsatum (Roodzwarte dennencicade). \n \nFor plant species, climate warming was the second most important cause of recent changes in the \nDutch flora. Thermophiles (warmth-preferring species) increased in occurrence, though cold-\npreferring species are not (yet) on the decline [Tamis et al., 2005]. Particularly in dry ecosystems, \nsuch as calcareous grasslands, arable field margins and dunes, warmth-loving plant species are \nexpanding rapidly, while northern species are on the decline [Van der Staaij & Ozinga, 2008]. In \ncontrast, in some types of forest, northern species such as Empetrum nigrum (Kraaihei) and \nVaccinium vitis-idaea (Rode bosbes) are doing well [Bijlsma & Ten Hoedt, 2006]. This can be \nexplained by aging of the forests and changes in management, resulting in more mature, denser \nforests with a cooler microclimate [Van der Staaij & Ozinga, 2008].  \n \nFor animal species, a group of 20 cold preferring species did show declining population trends, while \nthe group of 20 warmth preferring species showed positive population trends [Nijhof et al., 2007]. \nThese groups included bird, butterfly and amphibian species. For 91 species showing a forward shift \nin phenology, no relation between population trends and earlier appearance or egg-laying could be \ndetected [Nijhof et al., 2007]. Examples of northern species which are likely to disappear from our \ncountry are butterfly species Plebeius optilete (Veenbesblauwtje), and plant species Goodyera repens \n(Dennenorchis), Neottia cordata (Kleine keverorchis) and Linnaea borealis (Linnaeusklokje).  \n \nFor the future, IPCC (2007) concluded that \u201cApproximately 20 to 30% of plant and animal species \nassessed so far are likely to be at increased risk of extinction if increases in global average \ntemperature exceed 1.5-2.5 \u00b0C (medium confidence).\u201d. These numbers are based on climate \nenvelope studies. The \u201cbioclimatic envelope\u201d is based on species\u201f distribution data, thus describing \n KfC 009/09  \n18 \nthe climatic conditions under which the species currently occurs. Future distributions of species\u201f are \nprojected on the assumption that the current envelopes reflect species\u201f environmental preferences, \nwhich will be retained under climate change. This approach assumes instantaneous species-range \nchange, so does not capture time lags associated with processes of dispersal, establishment, and \nlocal extinction. For Europe the numbers of species at risk of extinction are smaller than those in the \nworldwide assessment of the IPCC. Based on 1350 European plant species, it is predicted that 2-5% \nof the species experiences a range size loss of more than 80% in 2080, leading to endangerment or \nextinction from Europe [Thuiller et al., 2005]. In case there are no possibilities for species to move \nacross landscapes, the numbers increase up to 2% of species becoming extinct and 22% becoming \ncritically endangered. Any shift in range will lead to an increased risk of local extinction. For the \nAtlantic region in which the Netherlands is located on average 48% of the plant species will be lost at \nthe local scale under the severest climate change scenario tested [Thuiller et al., 2005]. \n \nFor the Netherlands, it must be noted that 75% of the plant species are in the centre or subcentre of \ntheir geographic range [Ozinga et al., 2007]. The number of southern species that might benefit from \nclimate change is relatively large in comparison to the number of northern species that are at risk. Of \nthe native species for which the Netherlands are not central in the geographical range, only 14% are \nnorthern species, the majority are southern species. There is thus a potential for increases in plant \nspecies richness at the national level, as more southern species may establish than the relatively few \nnorthern species that may disappear. However, the southern species may not all arrive in the \nNetherlands when climate changes proceeds faster than their dispersal or when the fragmented \noccurrence of their habitats inhibits dispersal. For butterflies it has been shown that only those \nspecies that were capable of dispersing over large distances or using widespread habitats were able \nto respond to climate change by expanding northwards [Warren et al., 2001]. Therefore, species \nnatural adaptation responses to climate change can be strongly inhibited by habitat fragmentation [Hill \net al., 1999; Opdam & Wascher, 2004]. \n \nEcosystem types in the Netherlands with a relatively large percentage of cold preferring species are: \nraised bogs and moist heathlands, shallow pools on sandy soil, forests of poor soils and wet \ngrasslands. These ecosystems will likely face significant changes in species composition with \nunknown consequences for ecosystem functioning and achieving nature policy goals. Ecosystem \ntypes with a relatively large percentage of warmth loving species are: arable fields, calcareous \ngrasslands, dry grasslands and shrublands [Blom et al., 2007; Vos et al., 2007a]. \n \nLong-term effects on whole ecosystems remain largely unclear. It can be expected that species with \nhigh nutrient demands would benefit from the warming-induced stimulation of nitrogen mineralization, \nbut this has not been tested. Interactions with other global change components could also be \nimportant. Results of a peat bog ecosystem model suggested that climate warming may still increase \ncarbon accumulation under low nitrogen conditions, but will decrease carbon accumulation at high N \ndeposition sites [Heijmans et al., 2008]. This was because warming at high nitrogen conditions \ncaused a strong expansion of vascular plants at the cost of peat-forming peat mosses. Shifts in \nspecies abundances had consequences for the ecosystem service of carbon sequestration.  \n \nFor lakes in the Netherlands it is expected that a temperature rise of 2-3 \u00b0C may cause a switch from \nwaterplant-dominated clear lakes to algae-dominated \u201egreen soup\u201f lakes with negative impacts on \nbiodiversity [Van de Bund & Van Donk, 2004]. This is expected because internal nutrient loading \nincreases with temperature, exacerbating existing eutrophication problems [Moss et al., 2003]. \nResults of mesocosm experiments carried out in shallow lakes along a north-south gradient in Europe \nindicated that negative effects of eutrophication on ecosystem functioning will increase by warmer \ntemperatures [Moss et al., 2004]. To counteract the effects of climate warming, lake restoration \nmeasures combating eutrophication, such as reduction of planktivorous fish mass, will need to be \nintensified. In addition, measures that enhance the resilience of lake ecosystems [Scheffer et al., \n2001], such as more natural water level fluctuations and development of a vegetated shoreline, have \nbeen suggested to withstand the additional stress resulting from climate change [Mooij et al., 2005].  \n \nClimate change impacts on natural ecosystems   \n 19 \n2.3.  Impacts of changing patterns of precipitation \n2.3.1.  Increased frequency of flooding \nThe expected increase in winter precipitation will increase winter discharge of the rivers and streams, \nresulting in more frequent flooding or longer duration of inundation of flood plains and low lying areas. \nMore frequent extreme rain events in summer additionally increase the frequency of flooding. \nMoreover, deliberate flooding will be accommodated in designated water retention or water storage \nareas as adaptation to prevent flooding of vulnerable areas (see also chapter 3). Research in this \ncontext has shown that flooding strongly increases nutrient availability, likely resulting in reductions of \nspecies richness. Inundation of areas with (a history of) agricultural land use may cause the release of \nlarge quantities of phosphorus, because of iron reduction under anoxic conditions [Loeb, 2008]. \nIncreased frequency of flooding will likely lead to changes in vegetation composition as plant species \ndiffer in susceptibility to waterlogging and flooding. The duration of the flooding, as well as the \nseasonality and frequency of flooding, all impact on species distributions [Lamers et al., 2006]. Most \nplants will survive winter flooding, but many species are very sensitive to summer flooding [Van Eck et \nal., 2006]. Floodplain sites with high frequency of flooding have been shown to harbor a small set of \ncommon plant species in comparison to other river floodplain sites [Beumer et al., 2008]. Therefore, \nusing existing wetlands for water storage poses a serious threat to their biodiversity [Lamers et al., \n2006] \n \nThe creation of water retention and water storage areas is generally being combined with nature \ndevelopment strategies. However, high nutrient availability in combination with altered hydrological \nregimes will impose major constraints on the development of wetlands. Up till now, species-rich sedge \nmarshes, floodplain forests or mesotrophic grasslands have hardly developed in these areas [Lamers \net al., 2006]. Results from pilot projects on combining water storage with nature development \n[Stuijfzand et al., 2007] demonstrate that sediments including adsorbed nutrients and toxicants are \nmostly deposited close to the stream on the first possible occasion, leaving more downstream areas \nless impacted by the high water peak. Flooding will have more (negative) impacts on low productive \necosystems than on high productive ecosystems such as wetland forests. Another aspect is that \ninundation reduces the possibilities for management, i.e. mowing or grazing. The combination of \nnature development and water retention upstream of existing nature could be beneficial, because of \nimprovement of the water quality after passage of the retention area and buffering against large water \ntable fluctuations [Stuijfzand et al., 2008].  \n \nFor two shallow lakes in the Botshol nature reserve it has been observed that the lakes switched from \nwaterplant-dominated clear state to phytoplankton-dominated turbid state after wet winters. In wet \nwinters with high groundwater levels runoff from land to lake water transports phosphorus and humic \nacids to the lake, increasing phytoplankton density and light attenuation in the water column, \nenhancing instability of the waterplant populations [Rip et al. 2007]. \n2.3.2.  Summer drought \nDecreased summer precipitation is assumed in 2 of the 4 KNMI scenarios. This would decrease \nsummer discharge of rivers and lower summer groundwater levels, particularly in areas which depend \non rain water for water supply. For raised bog vegetation, an outdoor mesocosm experiment showed \nthat more frequent summer water table drawdown brought about shifts in Sphagnum species \nabundance and a shift from graminoid to ericoid vascular plant cover [Breeuwer et al., 2008]. \nExperimental summer drought during two months in a Dutch dry heathland ecosystem tended to \nreduce plant aboveground productivity [Pe\u00f1uelas et al., 2007], which was opposite to the response to \nthe warming treatment (Table 2). Although soil nutrient availability was decreased, which would give \nthe heather a competitive advantage, herbivory damage of the heather was increased in the drought \ntreatment. Therefore, it is uncertain whether drought will increase the abundance of heather [Wessel \net al., 2004]. \n2.3.3.  Extreme weather events \nFuture climate changes are expected to be accompanied not only by a shift in mean values, but also \nby increasing temporal variability. Extreme weather events such as drought and heavy rainfall are \nlikely to become more frequent. In Europe, severe floods and summer heat waves are expected to \noccur more frequently. The ecological effects of extreme events have been identified as one of the \nmain gaps of knowledge in community ecology. \n KfC 009/09  \n20 \nAlterations in vegetation composition after severe drought, heavy rainfall events and heat waves have \nall been documented [Jentsch & Beierkuhnlein, 2008]. Future projections for Europe suggest \nsignificant reductions in species richness even under mean climate change conditions [Thuiller et al., \n2005], and an increased frequency of extreme events is likely to exacerbate overall biodiversity losses \n[Thuiller et al., 2005]. It is assumed that increased frequency of extreme weather events enlarges \nfluctuations in the size of populations leading to local extinctions. Following two extreme winter floods \nin 1993-94 and 1994-95, an overall reduction in species richness, from c. 24 to 15 species m\n-2\n, and an \nincrease in biomass production have been observed in Rhine floodplain grasslands. These effects \nwere only partly reversed after ten years [Beltman et al., 2007]. \n \nThe 2003 heatwave affected ecosystems through heat and drought stress and wildfires [Fischlin et al., \n2007]. Fire extent was exceptionally large in Europe in 2003. Also in the Netherlands there were \nwildfires in summer 2003 and July 2006 (A. Getz, personal communication). Other reported effects \nfollowing extreme weather events are: a rapid switch of ecosystem into alternative ecological regime \n[Scheffer & Carpenter, 2003], and biotic communities becoming more susceptible to invasion following \nextreme events. For example bark-boring pest insect species are expected to become more \nabundant, because they benefit from reduced resistance of trees in dry summers such as in 2003 \n[Moraal, 2007]. For plant species it has been shown that both exotic species from other continents \nand southern species expanding their range gradually can establish successfully because of enemy \nrelease [Van Grunsven et al., 2007]. Enemy release means that the plant species disperse faster than \ntheir natural enemies (such as soil pathogens), so that the plants become released from top-down \ncontrol. \n2.4.  Impacts of sea level rise \n2.4.1.  Coastal ecosystems: erosion \nEffects of sea level rise on coastal ecosystems depend strongly on the rates of sea level rise. Beyond \na critical limit of 3-6 mm/yr, tidal flats and beyond 8.5 mm/yr salt marshes may drown, causing loss of \nhabitat for benthos consuming birds and seals [Oost et al., 2005]. According to the Delta Committee \nwe should consider a sea level rise of 11 mm/yr as a possibility [Vellinga et al., 2008].  \nResearch on the effects of soil subsidence due to gas extraction at Ameland gives us information on \nthe effects of relative sea level rise. The observed soil subsidence of about 30 cm in 20 years, i.e. 15 \nmm/yr, did not affect tidal flats because of compensatory sand deposition [Eysink, 2005]. No \nindications of impacts on wader birds were found. Similarly, salt marshes have not been affected \nbecause of compensation by sedimentation. The dune valleys are clearly wetter and inundated for a \nlonger time in winter which affects the vegetation composition. Dry dunes have not been affected at \nall. Coastal sand suppletion, the main adaptation strategy for flood protection of the North Sea coast, \nmay contribute to adaptation of the Wadden Sea area to sea level rise by supporting the natural \nprocess of sedimentation. \n2.4.2.  Inland ecosystems: salinization \nFor the lower part of the Netherlands it is expected that salinization of ground and surface water will \nincrease, mainly because of sea level rise and land subsidence. Low groundwater levels and river \ndischarges in dry summers will further enhance inland intrusion of salt water.  In addition, restoration \nof salinity gradients, as suggested for Haringvliet, deliberately causes salinization. Restoration of a \nsalinity gradient in Krammer-Volkerak Zoommeer has been suggested by the Delta Committee in \norder to solve the water quality problem, which can offer new ecological opportunities. Another \nsuggestion, raising lake IJsselmeer level up to 1.5 m in order to secure fresh water supplies, however, \ncombats salinization in the Western Netherlands. \n \nMany freshwater organisms can adapt to some extent to increased salt concentrations in their \nenvironment. However, the large variation in salt concentration typical of brackish environments poses \na larger threat. Therefore, brackish environments are generally poor in number of species, but contain \nspecialized species which do not occur in other places. \n \nLiterature study by Paulissen & Schouwenberg (2007) revealed that little is known about salt \ntolerance of fresh water organisms and communities. Most plant communities of the lower part of NL \noccur exclusively in freshwater areas, suggesting they are sensitive to salinization. Salt water \nindicating plant species mostly occur in tidal areas and closed-off sea arms.  \n \nClimate change impacts on natural ecosystems   \n 21 \nIt is noted that salinization will not only have negative effects. Salinization may result in new brackish \nareas which are currently rare because of artificial sharp borders between fresh and saltwater areas. \nMesocosm experiments by Loeb (2008) suggest that restoration of the tidal regime with brackish \nwater is likely to bring back the characteristic brackish water plants.  \n2.5.  Impacts of elevated atmospheric CO2 \n2.5.1.  Ecosystem processes \nApart from being a greenhouse gas, which largely caused the anthropogenic part of 20\nth\n century \nclimate change, CO2 is the major substrate for plant photosynthesis with cascading effects on \nvegetation structure and composition and plant-herbivore relationships. Atmospheric CO2 \nconcentrations have risen from 280 ppm in pre-industrial times to 383 ppm in 2007, which exceeds \nany experienced during the past 20 million years [Global Carbon Project, 2008]. CO2 concentrations in \nthe atmosphere will continue to rise to 540 \u2013 830 ppm in 2100, depending on emission scenarios. As \nliving biomass (plants and animals) consist roughly for 50% of carbon, it is hard to imagine that a \ndoubling of the atmospheric carbon availability would not have impacts on plants and ecosystems. For \nthese reasons we cannot ignore CO2 when discussing climate change impacts on natural \necosystems. We will briefly review the general effects of atmospheric CO2 on natural ecosystems, \nalthough the steady CO2 enrichment of the atmosphere is strictly seen not a climatic change. \n \nIt is well known that when plants are exposed to increasing atmospheric CO2, they will increase \nphotosynthetic CO2 uptake, saturating at close to 1000 ppm. When plants are grown individually, \nspecies with C3 type of photosynthesis produce more biomass under elevated CO2 than species with \nC4 type of photosynthesis [Poorter & Navas, 2003]. However, after thirty years of CO2 research, it \nturned out that the rate of CO2 uptake per unit leaf area is a rather unreliable predictor of plant growth \nand related ecosystem processes (K\u00f6rner et al. 2007). Carbon uptake by photosynthesis can not be \ndirectly translated into plant production, because the investment of carbon in structural plant tissues \nrequires mineral nutrients. A comparison of 6 field experiments in 8 natural grassland ecosystems, in \nwhich elevated CO2 treatments have been compared to ambient CO2 conditions, revealed an average \n20% increase of grassland biomass [K\u00f6rner et al., 2007]. Also in mature trees, experimental exposure \nto elevated CO2 resulted in a 10-20% increase in net primary production (NPP) [K\u00f6rner et al., 2007]. \nThis is much less than the predicted 60% increase in NPP on average by 2100 by six dynamic global \nvegetation models, which are mostly based on plant physiological processes such as photosynthesis \n[Cramer et al., 2001]. \n \nIt is assumed that part of this observed CO2 fertilization effect is actually an indirect effect through \nimproved water relations. When CO2 concentrations are elevated, plants stomata need less time to be \nopen to absorb a given amount of CO2, resulting in smaller water losses through stomata. This \nincreased water use efficiency, which mitigates drought stress for plants, is found in nearly 100 \ncontrolled experiments. At the ecosystem level a remarkably consistent 5-10% reduction of \nevapotranspiration is observed among several types of vegetation [K\u00f6rner et al., 2007]. At the \nlandscape level the reduction is probably less, because vegetation-atmosphere feedbacks cannot be \nincluded in plot-scale field experiments. Reduced plant water losses at the landscape level would \nmean a reduced loading of the atmosphere with water vapor, and the resulting lower relative humidity \nwould then increase evaporative water losses. For the Netherlands, it is estimated that the direct \neffects of CO2 reduce evapotranspiration up to 5% in 2050 and up to 15 % by 2100, particularly in \nsummer and in natural vegetation [Kruijt et al., 2008]. These reductions are of comparable but \nopposite magnitude to predicted temperature-induced increases in evapotranspiration (Table 2). \nUsing a hydrological model they demonstrated that this CO2-effect would lead to a much reduced \ngroundwater drop in summer than can be expected from climate change alone [Kruijt et al., 2008]. \n \nThe response of natural ecosystems to elevated CO2 seems strongly dependent on the availability of \nnutrients. Elevated CO2 has indirect effects on soil nutrient availability. It has been assumed that \nelevated CO2 changes plant litter quality (by increased C:N ratio) and leads to a slowing down of \ndecomposition, but this is not generally supported by experimental results. Under elevated CO2 the \nadditional carbon taken up, which is not invested in structural plant growth, may be exported through \nroots. The increased availability of these excreted carbohydrates may stimulate microbial activity and \nnutrient mineralization. On the other hand, these microbes become competitors for nutrients thereby \nreducing soil nutrient availability for plants. There was no significant effect of elevated CO2 on net N \nmineralization in a meta-analysis of CO2 experiments [De Graaff et al., 2006]. \n KfC 009/09  \n22 \n2.5.2.  Species composition \nGiven that changes in atmospheric CO2 alter the relative availability of carbon, water, and nutrients, \nimportant resources for plant growth, which in turn alters competitive interactions among plants, \nchanges in diversity or dominance patterns are likely to occur. Indeed, several field experiments in \nnatural ecosystems showed that plant species respond differentially to elevated CO2, in the long term \nresulting in shifts in vegetation composition [Potvin et al., 2007]. In the Netherlands, field experiments \ninvolving CO2 enrichment have been conducted in peatland plant communities [Heijmans et al., \n2001b; Milla et al., 2006; Toet et al., 2006]. The effects of the elevated CO2 treatment were limited, \nparticularly in the Sphagnum-Phragmites reedland, but in the raised bog vegetation summer \nevapotranspiration was significantly reduced [Heijmans et al., 2001a] and peat mosses grew faster in \nheight giving them a competitive advantage over low-statured vascular plants [Heijmans et al., \n2001b]. \n \nFar from clear is which species, in general, take competitive advantage from elevated CO2. Although \nfor many species it has been tested how they respond to high CO2 concentrations in greenhouse \nexperiments, this does not predict who will win in natural communities. For example, fast-growing \nspecies responded most strongly to elevated CO2 when grown in isolation in a greenhouse, but this \nwas not the case in mixed communities  [Poorter & Navas, 2003]. A peat bog modeling study \nsuggested that the species whose growth is least limited by nitrogen, in this case peatforming \nSphagnum mosses, will benefit from elevated CO2 at the cost of species that require more nitrogen \n[Heijmans et al., 2008]. This might be more generally applicable, but it remains to be seen whether \nthis pattern is also visible in field experiments and observations. \n \nTable 2.

Adaptation \n3.1.  Adaptation in the Netherlands \nThroughout its history, Dutch society has always taken adaptation measures dealing with many water-\nrelated challenges. From the early Middle Ages dikes have been built. Flood abatement measures \nand reclamation projects took place on increasingly larger scales. This culminated in large-scale \nworks such as the closure of the Zuiderzee and the Delta Project in the twentieth century. Flood \nprotection remains a top priority, but nowadays interactions with agriculture, nature, recreation, \nlandscape, infrastructure and energy are taken into consideration when developing adaptation \nstrategies [Kabat et al., 2005]. The Delta Committee even stresses the opportunities for Dutch society \nin their recent advice on how to increase safety against flooding, while still remaining an attractive \nplace to live, to reside and work, for recreation and investment. \n \nThe main change in the Dutch adaptation policy for flood protection is that instead of heightening the \ndykes along rivers, occasional flooding will be accommodated and carefully managed in specific \ndesignated areas [Kabat et al., 2005]. In the river area, many works are on-going, in order to make \nmore \u201cRoom for the River\u201d inbetween the dykes. This involves creation of side channels, lowering the \nflood plains and removing barriers to water flow. These adaptation measures increase \nhydrodynamics, which may conflict with biodiversity conservation goals when low-dynamic parts of the \nfloodplains will disappear. Many protected and endangered riverine animal species require ecotopes \nalong the entire hydrodynamic gradient [De Nooij et al., 2006]. Pilot projects on water storage and \nwater retention in designated areas in order to reduce peak water flows have started (see also 2.3.1.). \nFor coastal protection the emphasis is on beach nourishments by sand suppletion. This may enhance \nthe capacity of coastal ecosystems to adapt naturally to sea level rise (see also 2.4.1.). In the peat \nareas of the Netherlands, climate warming is assumed to accelerate peat oxidation, leading to further \nland subsidence and more complex water management [Kwakernaak & Dauvellier, 2007]. This \noxidation of peat also contributes significantly to the Dutch emission of greenhouse gases. Adaptation \nmeasures involve increasing water levels or inundation in combination with nature development. The \nimpacts on existing nature have not been addressed. Inundation may for example conflict with current \nmeadow bird conservation in grassland ecosystems. 96 adaptation options have been described in \nthe \u201cRouteplanner\u201d project [Van Drunen, 2007]. These include adaptation strategies to combat the \nnegative effects of climate change on water systems, nature and agriculture, energy, transport, \nhousing and infrastructure, public health, and recreation. \n3.2.  Adaptation to climate change for natural ecosystems \nAs described in chapter 2, climatic changes will impact on abiotic site conditions, plant productivity \nand species composition, with consequences for the habitats of plants and animals. In order to reduce \nthe vulnerability of natural ecosystems to the impacts of climate change, adaptation strategies have \nbeen proposed (Table 3). While an integrated picture of how ecosystems in the Netherlands will \nchange due to climate change is still lacking, a general adaptation strategy to climate change is to \nreduce and manage the other stresses on species and ecosystems, such as habitat fragmentation \nand eutrophication. In the Netherlands, focus is on reducing habitat fragmentation. \n \nRange shifts of species in response to climate change have been reported for a wide range of taxa \nand regions and further shifts are projected. Whether species can colonize new areas to expand their \nrange northward depends both on species and landscape characteristics. A primary adaptation \nstrategy is therefore to increase spatial cohesion of ecological networks, such as the Dutch National \nEcological Network (NEN, Ecologische hoofdstructuur (EHS) in Dutch) and the EU Natura 2000 \nnetwork. By combining bioclimate envelope models, which project future species distributions, with \ndispersal models, Vos et al. (2008) developed a method to identify areas where the spatial cohesion \nof ecosystem networks is not sufficient to accommodate species\u201f responses to climate change. The \nbest locations for ecological corridors where improving connectivity is most urgent can then be \npinpointed.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n KfC 009/09  \n24 \nTable 3. Seven adaptation strategies to counteract the impacts of climate change on natural \necosystems (based on Vos et al., 2007b). \n \nRecently \u201cnatural climate buffers\u201d have been proposed by a consortium of nature conservation \norganizations. Natural climate buffers involve restoration of natural landscape-forming processes for \nadaptation of the water system to climate change and creating opportunities for other functions such \nas nature, recreation and housing. Examples are: meandering rivers, increase water holding capacity \nin sand region, and increase water level in fen peat area (Table 4). Restoration of natural landscape-\nforming processes likely creates more spontaneous and diverse nature. \n \nMost nature reserves in the Netherlands are rather intensively managed by national organizations like \nStaatsbosbeheer en Natuurmonumenten. So there is already quite some experience in adaptation to \nchanging environmental conditions. The management is often aimed at nature conservation or at \nrestoring prescribed nature target types. Consensus is growing that conserving current species \ncomposition and using static target species and nature target types is not very climate-proof. Nature \nmanagement will need to shift from conserving nature to accommodating natural processes. In \naddition, creation of an international network of nature reserves including ecological corridors is in the \nlight of climate change more urgent than it has been before, in order to facilitate northward movement \nof plant and animal species. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Adaptation strategy How ? \nI Increase spatial cohesion of the NEN and \nNatura 2000 ecological networks  \nRobust ecological corridors and other measures \nto increase connectivity \nII Increase ecological resilience of \necosystems \nIncrease the area of nature reserves and \nincrease heterogeneity within nature reserves \nIII Improve abiotic conditions within nature \nreserves \nManagement and increase the water holding \ncapacity of nature reserves \nIV Embedding of NEN and Natura 2000 areas \nwithin multifunctional climate buffers \n \nV Nature as integral part of multifunctional \nspatial adaptation \nNature development in water retention or water \nstorage areas \nVI Increase learning capacity of society, \ndealing with uncertainty \nMonitoring adaptation projects \nVII New vision on nature in spatial planning Introduce dynamics in nature policy instead of \nconservation of static target species and nature \ntypes \n \nClimate change impacts on natural ecosystems   \n 25 \nTable 4.

Current research, uncertainties and research priorities \n4.1.  Current research \nAnalyses of current research on climate change and adaptation in relation to nature have been carried \nout by Veraart et al. (2006) and Vos et al. (2007b). Much of ongoing research in the Netherlands is \nrelated to adaptation of NEN, and to multifunctional adaptation, which often combines nature \ndevelopment with river flood protection as in \u201cRoom for the River\u201d and \u201cNatural Climate Buffers\u201d. The \nresearch on multifunctional adaptation includes research on all three phases described by Vos et al. \n(2007b), i.e. more fundamental research on the effects and biogeochemical processes of flooding, \nresearch on spatial translation into adaptation strategies, and monitoring of pilot projects to evaluate \nimplemented adaptation measures. \n \nIn addition to research on adaptation, there is research on the development of indicators (species) for \nmonitoring climate change effects, searching for species traits that determine vulnerability to climate \nchange, and development of models to predict the changes in vegetation and ecosystems of the \nNetherlands due to climate change. Most of this research is embedded in programmes of \u201cClimate \nchanges Spatial Planning\u201d (Klimaat voor Ruimte) and the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and \nFood Quality. Additional research, mainly at universities and the research institute NIOO, takes place \non phenological shifts, invasive species both in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, and impacts on \naquatic ecosystems. Field studies to investigate the effects of climate change on whole ecosystems or \nto provide the models with supporting data are currently lacking. \n4.2.  Key uncertainties and research priorities \nThe effects of separate climatic changes on ecosystem processes and species composition have \nbeen relatively well studied in an international context. Still far from clear are the long-term effects of \nclimatic changes on whole ecosystems including abiotic site conditions and stochastic events like wild \nfires, pest outbreaks and invasions of exotic species. Such knowledge is required to formulate \nadaptation strategies for the management of Dutch nature reserves. We do not know what the net \neffect of climatic changes combined with high CO2 concentrations is on site conditions such as soil \nmoisture and nutrient availability which determine the competitive relations between plant species. \nThis also affects animal species whose habitats are dependent on the vegetation composition. \nTherefore research priorities include: \n\uf0b7 What is the combined effect of expected climatic changes, including increasing atmospheric CO2, \non the site conditions relevant to ecosystem functioning (e.g. soil moisture, soil temperature, \nnutrient availability)? \n\uf0b7 What is the impact of climate change on disturbances such as wild fires, pest outbreaks, and \ninvasions by exotic species and what is the role of extreme weather events? Are they catalysts of \ngradual changes or will they result in ecological surprises? \n\uf0b7 Which types of species (apart from northern species) and ecosystems will be most vulnerable to \nthe impacts of climate change, as determined by exposure and sensitivity to climatic changes? \n\uf0b7 Are there interactions of climate change effects with the effects of other environmental \ndisturbances (e.g. N deposition or eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems)? \n\uf0b7 Where do adaptation measures aimed at flood protection or reducing peat oxidation conflict with \nexisting nature and what level of biodiversity and ecosystem services can be expected in areas \nwhere adaptation is combined with nature development? \n\uf0b7 What references and targets should be used in nature management and policy to replace the \ncurrent static target species and habitat types in order to climate proof nature policy \n KfC 009/09  \n28 \n \nClimate change impacts on natural ecosystems   \n 29 \nReferences \n \nAndriesse, L.A., G.J.

By \u2018mainstream\u2019 we\nmean the type of climate science that dominates in universities and research\ncentres, which we will term \u2018academic\u2019 climate science, in contrast to \u2018pol-\nicy\u2019 climate science; aspects of this distinction will become clearer in what\nfollows.\nIn a nutshell, we do not think that academic climate science equips climate\nscientists to be as helpful as they might be, when involved in climate policy\nassessment. Partly, we attribute this to an over-investment in high resolution\nclimate simulators, and partly to a culture that is uncomfortable with the\ninherently subjective nature of climate uncertainty.\n\u2217Corresponding author.

Section 3 addresses the aparently com-\nmon misconception (among climate scientists) that uncertainty is something\n\u2018out there\u2019 to be quantified, much like the strength of meridional overturning\ncirculation. Section 4, the heart of the essay, addresses the core needs of the\npolicymaker, and focuses on three strictures for the climate scientist want-\ning to help her: answer the question, own the judgement, and be coherent.\nSection 5 concludes with a brief reflection.\nWe have taken the opportunity in this essay to be a little more polemical\nthan we might be in an academic paper, and maybe a little more exuberent\nin our expressions. We have also ignored the technical details of practical cli-\nmate science, something we are both involved in day-to-day, choosing instead\nto look at the larger picture. We believe that our observations are valid more\nwidely than just climate science; for example many of them would apply\nwith little modification in many areas of natural hazards, and in radiological\nor ecotoxicological risk assessment (Rougier et al., 2013). But they seem\nmost pertinent in climate science, which outstrips the other areas in terms\nof funding. For example, the UK\u2019s Natural Environment Research Council\n(NERC), whose vision is to \u201cadvance knowledge and understanding of the\nEarth and its environments to help secure a sustainable future for the planet\nand its people\u201d, allocates 40% of its science budget to climate science and\nearth system science (NERC Annual Report and Accounts 2010\u201311, p. 40).\n2 Different modes of climate science\nFor our purposes, the telling feature of climate science is that it gained much\nof its momentum in the era before climate change became a pressing soci-\netal concern. Consequently, when policymakers turned to climate science\nfor advice, they encountered a well-developed academic field whose focus\nwas more towards explanation than prediction. Explanation, in this context,\nis verifying that observable regularities in the climate system are emergent\nproperties of the basic physics. Largely this is through the interplay between\nobservation and dynamical climate simulation. As the resolution of climate\n2\nsimulators increases, more observed regularities fall into the \u2018explained\u2019 cat-\negory. The El Nin\u02dco Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is getting closer to falling\ninto this category, for example (Guilyardi et al., 2009).\nThus for investment, the dominant vector in academic climate science has\nbeen to improve the spatial and temporal resolution of the solvers in climate\nsimulators. Supporting evidence can be found in meteorology. It is argued\nthat one of the contributory factors to measurable improvements in weather\nforecasting over the last thirty years is higher-resolution solvers, although\nthe quantification of this is confounded by simultaneous improvements in\nunderstanding the physics, in the amount of data available for calibration,\nand in techniques for data assimilation (Kalnay, 2002, ch. 1). Setting these\nconfounders aside, it seems natural to assert that higher resolution solvers\nwill lead to better climate simulators. And indeed, we would not deny this,\nbut we would also question whether in fact it is resolution that is limiting\nthe fidelity of climate simulators.\nThe reason that we are suspicious of arguments about climate founded\non experiences in meteorology is the presence of biological and chemical pro-\ncesses in the earth system that operate on climate policy but not weather\ntime-scales. We believe that the acknowledgement of biogeochemistry as a\nfull part of the climate system distinguishes the true climate scientist from\nthe converted meteorologist. Our lack of understanding of climate\u2019s critical\necosystems mocks the precision with which we can write down and approx-\nimate the Navier-Stokes equations. The problem is, though, that putting\necosystems into a climate simulator is a huge challenge, and progress is diffi-\ncult to quantify. It introduces more uncertain parameters, and, by replacing\nprescribed fields with time-evolving fields, it can actually make the perfor-\nmance of the simulator worse, until tuning is successfully completed (and\nthere is no guarantee of success). Newman (2011) provides a short and read-\nable account of the difficulties of biology, in comparison to physics.\nOn the other hand, spending money on higher resolution solvers requires\nfewer parameterisations of sub-grid-scale processes, and so reduces the chal-\nlenge of tuning. This activity has a well-documented provenance, and a clear\nmotivation within a coherent science plan. And we cannot resist pointing out\n3\nanother immediate benefit: one can show the funder a more realistic looking\nocean simulation (\u201cNow at 0.5\u25e6 resolution!\u201d)\u2014although in fact resolutions as\nhigh as 0.1\u25e6 do not fool experienced oceanographers. But while this push to\nhigher resolutions is natural for meteorology, with its forecast horizon mea-\nsured in days, for climate we fear that it blurs the distinction between what\none can simulate, and what one ought to simulate for policy purposes.\nSo how might the investment be directed differently? For climate pol-\nicy it is necessary to enumerate what might happen under different climate\ninterventions: do nothing, monetise carbon, regulation for contraction and\nconvergence, geo-engineering, and so on. And each of these interventions\nmust be evaluated for a range of scenarios that capture future uncertainty\nabout technology, economics, and demographics. For each pair of interven-\ntion and scenario there is a range of possible outcomes, which represent our\nuncertainty about future climate. Uncertainty here is \u2018total uncertainty\u2019:\nonly the intervention and the scenario are specified\u2014the policymaker does\nnot have the luxury of being able to pick and choose which uncertainties are\nincorporated and which are ignored.\nInternal variability, part of the natural variability of the climate system,\ncan be estimated from high-resolution simulators, but it is only a tiny part\nof total uncertainty. Over centurial scales, it is negligible compared to our\ncombined uncertainty of the behaviour of the ice-sheets, and the marine and\nterrestrial biosphere. This uncertainty can be assessed with the assistance\nof climate simulators, if it is possible to run them repeatedly under differ-\nent configurations of the simulator parameters and modules, where these\nconfigurations attempt to span the range of not-implausible climate system\nbehaviours. To construct a tableau such as the one in Figure 1 will require\na minimum of 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 100 \u00d7 90 models-years of simulation, say 120,000\nmodel-years, including spin-up. The 100 is the number of different simulator\nconfigurations that might be tried, and the 90 is the number of years un-\ntil 2100. Of course, 100 is woefully small for the number of configurations.\nThere are more than one hundred uncertain parameters in a high-resolution\nclimate simulator (Murphy et al., 2004). Admittedly only some of these will\nturn out to be important but we cannot rule out interactions among the pa-\n4\nIn\nte\nrv\nen\ntio\nns\nScenarios\nDo nothing\nMonetise carbon\nRegulation\nGeo\u2212engineering\nBusiness\nas usual\nHigh pop\u2212\nulation growth\nTechnology\nbails us out\n0K +5K 0K +5K 0K +5K\n0K +5K 0K +5K 0K +5K\n0K +5K 0K +5K 0K +5K\n0K +5K 0K +5K 0K +5K\nFigure 1: Policy tableau, showing the effect of different possible interventions\nunder different scenarios. These frequency histograms might in this case\nmeasure simulated global warming by 2100 under different not-implausible\nsimulator configurations, but more generally they would measures losses,\ninferred from simulated distributions for weather in 2100. Please note that\nthese histograms are completely fictitious!\n5\nrameters. There is a well-developed statistical field for this type of analysis,\nsee, e.g., Santner et al. (2003).\nNote that this is a designed experiment, deliberately constructed to be\ninformative about uncertainty. It is completely different from assembling an\nad hoc collection of simulator runs, such as the CMIP3 or CMIP5 multimodel\nensembles, in the same way that a carefully stratified sample of 100 people\nis far more informative about a population than simply selecting the next\n100 people that pass a particular lamp-post. In the absence of designed\nexperiments, though, climate scientists who want to assess uncertainty will\nhave to use the ad hoc ensemble. The various types and uses of currently-\navailable ensembles of climate simulator runs are reviewed in Parker (2010)\nand Murphy et al. (2011).\nSo what is the status of these policy-relevant designed experiments? Cur-\nrent \u2018IPCC class\u2019 simulators (with a solver resolution of about 1\u25e6) run at\nabout 100 model-years per month of wall-clock time. So starting now, an\nexperiment to assess uncertainty in 2100 for policy purposes will be finished\nin about 100 years, if it is performed at one research centre. But this might\nbe reduced to 10 years if the runs were shared out across all centres, or even\nless factoring in faster computers and no increase in resolution. Thus these\nIPCC class simulators could be very helpful for assessing uncertainty and\nsupporting policymakers, but this requires a cap on solver resolution, and\ncareful coordination across research centres. In contrast, the current uncoor-\ndinated approach, with its apparent commitment to spending CPU cycles on\na few runs of high-resolution climate simulators, will force climate scientists\nin 2020 to base their future climate assessments on ad hoc ensembles.\n3 The nature of uncertainty about climate\nIn this paper we confine our discussion of climate uncertainty quantification\nto the assessment of probabilities. There are, of course, several interpreta-\ntions of probability. L.J. Savage wrote of \u201cdozens\u201d of different interpretations\nof probability Savage (1954, p. 2), and he focused on three main strands: the\nObjective (or Frequentist), the Personalistic, and the Necessary. This tripar-\n6\ntite classification is widely accepted among statisticians, and discussed, with\nembellishments, in the initial chapters of Walley (1991) and Lad (1996). Not\nto be outdone, Ha\u00b4jek (2012) notes that philosophers of probability now have\nsix leading interpretations of probability.\nOf all of these interpretations, however, we contend that only the Per-\nsonalistic interpretation can capture the \u2018total uncertainty\u2019 inherent in the\nassessment of climate policy. Our uncertainty about future climate is pre-\ndominantly epistemic uncertainty\u2014the uncertainty that follows from limi-\ntations in knowledge and resources. The hallmark of epistemic uncertainty\nis that it could, in principle, be reduced with further introspection, or fur-\nther experiments. As one of the key drivers of research investment in cli-\nmate science is to reduce uncertainty, this epistemic interpretation of \u2018total\nuncertainty\u2019 must be uncontentious. It rules out the Objective (classical,\nfrequency, propensity) interpretation, and leaves us with Personalistic and\nNecessary (also termed logical) interpretations.\nThe Necessary interpretation asserts that there are principles of reason-\ning that extend Boolean logic to uncertainty, and that these principles are in\nfact the calculus of probability and Bayesian conditioning. This interpreta-\ntion is formally attractive, but invokes additional principles to \u2018fill in\u2019 those\ninitial probabilities that are mandated by conditioning\u2014which are generally\nreferred to as \u2018prior\u2019 probabilities in a Bayesian context. These are to be\nbased on self-evident properties of the inference, such as symmetries. Exam-\nples are discussed in Jaynes (2003); see, for example, his elegant resolution\nof Bertrand\u2019s problem (sec. 12.4.4). However, it is hard to know how one\nmight discover and apply these properties in an assessment of, say, the max-\nimum height of the water in the Thames Estuary in 2100. Thus, starting\nwith Frank Ramsey, and finding eloquent champions in Bruno de Finetti\nand L.J. Savage, among others, the Personalistic interpretation has provided\nan operational subjective definition of probability, in terms of betting rates\n(see, e.g. Ramsey, 1931; de Finetti, 1964; Savage, 1954; Savage et al., 1962).\nDe Finetti\u2019s late writings are both subtle and discursive; Lad (1996) attempts\nto corral them.\nNot everyone will find the Personalistic definition of probability com-\n7\npelling. But at least it provides a very clear answer to the question \u201cWhat\ndo You mean when You state that Pr(A) = p?\u201d A brief answer is that, if\nbetting for a small amount of money, such as \u00a31, You would be agreeable\nto staking up to \u00a3p in a gamble to receive \u00a31 if A turns out to be true and\nnothing if A turns out to be false. There are other operationalisations as\nwell, which are very similar but not psychologically equivalent; see, e.g., the\ndiscussion in Goldstein and Wooff (2007, sec. 2.2). Our view is that an op-\nerationalisation of Personalistic probability is highly desirable, and a useful\nthing to fall back on, but not in itself the yardstick by which all probabilities\nare assessed. But, if someone provides a probability p for a proposition A,\nit might be a good idea to ask him if he would be prepared to bet \u00a3p on A\nbeing true: the answer could be very revealing.\nHowever, many physical scientists seem to be very uncomfortable with\nthe twin notions that uncertainty is subjective (i.e. it is a property of the\nmind), and that probabilities are expressions of personal inclinations to act\nin certain ways. At least part of the problem concerns the use of the word\n\u2018subjective\u2019, about which the first author has written before (Rougier, 2007,\nsec. 2). This word is clearly inflammatory. We suggest that some scientists\nhave confused the Mertonian scientific norm of \u2018disinterestedness\u2019 with the\nnotion of \u2018objectivity\u2019, and then taken subjectivity to be the antithesis of ob-\njectivity, and thus to be avoided at all costs. L.J. Savage was sensitive to this\nconfusion and hence favoured \u2018Personalistic\u2019. De Finetti strongly favoured\n\u2018subjective\u2019, about which Jeffrey (2004, p. 76, footnote 1) commented on \u201cthe\nlifelong pleasure that de Finetti found in being seen to give the finger to the\nestablishment\u201d.\nConfusion about \u2018subjectivity\u2019 is just a digression, though. What is abun-\ndantly clear is that climate scientists are not ready to accept that climate\nuncertainties are Personalistic. Their every reference to \u2018the uncertainty\u2019\ncommits an error which the physicist E.T. Jaynes called the \u2018mind projec-\ntion fallacy\u2019:\nan almost universal tendency to disguise epistemological state-\nments by putting them into a grammatical form which suggests\nto the unwary an ontological statement. To interpret the first\n8\nkind of statement in the ontological sense is to assert that one\u2019s\nown private thoughts and sensations are realities existing exter-\nnally in Nature. (Jaynes, 2003, p. 22).\nJaynes is an example of a physicist who embraced the essential subjectivity of\nuncertainty: he advocated the Necessary interpretation, plus the additional\nprinciple of maximising Shannon entropy to extend limited judgements to\nprobabilities. Paris (1994) provides a detailed assessment of the properties\nof this entropy-maximising approach, among others.\nOne very stealthy manifestation of the Mind Projection Fallacy is the\nsubstitution of \u2018assumptions\u2019 for \u2018judgements\u2019 when discussing uncertainty.\nAssumptions typically refer to simplifications we assert about the system\nitself. It is perfectly acceptable to assume that, for example, the hydrostatic\napproximation holds: this is a statement that actual ocean behaves a lot\nlike a slightly different ocean that is much simpler to analyse. You cannot\nassume, though, that the maximum water level in the Thames Estuary in\n2100 has a Gaussian distribution. Instead, You may judge it appropriate to\nrepresent Your uncertainty about the maximum water level with a Gaussian\ndistribution. This is rather wordy, unfortunately, which is perhaps why it is\nso easy to lapse in this way.\nConsider the uncertainty assessment guidelines for the forthcoming IPCC\nreport (Mastrandrea et al., 2010). Nowhere in the guidelines was it thought\nnecessary to define \u2018probability\u2019. Either the authors of the guidelines were\nnot aware that this concept was amendable to several different interpreta-\ntions, or that they were aware of this, and decided against bringing it out\ninto the open. One can imagine, for example, that an opening statement of\nthe form \u201cIn the context of climate prediction, probability is an expression\nof subjective uncertainty and it can be quantified with reference to a sub-\nject\u2019s betting behaviour\u201d would have caused great consternation\u2014so much\nthe better!\nWe can hardly suppose that the omission of a definition for the key con-\ncept in such an important and high-profile document was made in ignorance.\nAnd yet the mind projection fallacy is in evidence throughout. It looks\nas though the authors have deliberately chosen not to acknowledge the es-\n9\nsential subjectivity of climate uncertainty, and to suppress linguistic usage\nthat would indicate otherwise. This should be termed \u2018monster denial\u2019 in\nthe taxonomy of Curry and Webster (2011). Choosing not to rock the boat\nis convenient for academic climate scientists. But it makes life difficult for\npolicymakers, who are tasked with turning uncertainties into actions. For\npolicymakers, the meaning of \u2018Pr(A) = p\u2019 is of paramount importance, and\nthey need to know if ten different climate scientists mean it ten different\nways.\n4 The risk manager\u2019s point of view\nIn any discussion of uncertainty and policy it is helpful to label the key players\n(Smith, 2010, ch. 1). Conventionally, the person who selects the intervention\nis the risk manager, who represents a particular set of stakeholders. These\nstakeholders, who are funding the risk manager, and will also fund the in-\ntervention that she selects, will appoint an auditor, whom the risk manager\nmust satisfy. This framework, of a risk manager who must satisfy an au-\nditor, is a simple way to abstract from the complexities of any particular\ndecision. It emphasises that the risk manager is an agent who must defend\nher selection, and this has important consequences for the way in which she\nacts.\nThe risk manager is surely uncertain about future climate, and its impli-\ncations. For concreteness, suppose that her concern is about the maximum\nheight of water in the Thames Estuary in the year 2100. If asked, she might\nsay, \u201cReally, I\u2019ve no idea, perhaps not lower than today\u2019s value, and not more\nthan two metres higher.\u201d But she is not obliged to make such an assessment\nin isolation: she can consult an expert. Put simply, her expert is someone\nwhose judgements she accepts as her own (see Lad, 1996, sec. 6.3 for a discus-\nsion). So one task of the risk manager is to select her expert, and she must\ndo this in such a way that the auditor is satisfied with the selection process,\nand with the elicitation process. When seen from the other side, it follows\nthat scientists who want to be involved in climate policy are competing with\neach other to be selected as one of the risk manager\u2019s experts. Therefore\n10\nthey must demonstrate their grasp of the risk manager\u2019s needs. Likewise, for\nclimate scientists who are competing for policy-tagged funding.\nWe highlight the following three risk managers\u2019 needs, as posing particular\nchallenges for academic climate scientists.\n4.1 Answer the question\nAs already discussed, the risk manager needs an assessment of \u2018total un-\ncertainty\u2019. It can be difficult for the climate scientist to assess his total\nuncertainty about future climate because of academic climate science\u2019s focus\non consuming CPU cycles in higher-resolution solvers, rather than designed\nreplications across alternative not-implausible configurations of simulator pa-\nrameters and modules. This leaves the willing-to-engage climate scientist ill-\nequipped to answer questions about ranges for future climate values, because\nhe has nothing other than intuition to guide him on the consequence of the\nlimitations in our knowledge. Unfortunately, his intuition may be tentative\nat best when reasoning about a dynamical system as complex as the climate\nsystem, on centurial timescales.\nIn this case, the climate scientist may end up specifying very wide inter-\nvals which, although honest, do not advance the risk manager because they\nswamp any \u2018treatment effect\u2019 that might arise from different choices of inter-\nvention. This honest climate scientist may well be passed over in favour of\nother experts who advertise their smaller uncertainty as a putative measure\nof their superior expertise. This type of competition is extensively discussed\nin Tetlock (2005), in the context of political and economic forecasting, and\nthe parallels with climate forecasting seem very strong.\nHow to make the uncertainties smaller? One way is to qualify them with\nconditions. If these conditions are specified in the question, then of course\nthis is fine. If the risk manager, for example, wants to know about the\nheight of the water in the Thames Estuary under the \u2018Technology bails us\nout\u2019 scenario, then in it goes. But everything else is suspect. Sometimes the\nqualification is overt, for example one hears \u201cassuming that the simulator is\ncorrect\u201d quite frequently in verbal presentations, or perceives the presenter\n11\nsliding into this mindset. This is so obviously a fallacy that he might as well\nhave said \u201cassuming that the currency of the US is the jam doughnut\u201d. The\nrisk manager would be justified in treating such an assessment as meaning-\nless. After all, if the climate scientist is not himself prepared to assess the\nlimitations of the simulator, then what hope is there for the risk manager?\nAs Tetlock (2005) documents, though, often the qualifications are im-\nplicit, and only ever appear at the point where the judgement has been\nshown to be wrong, e.g. \u201cWell, of course I was assuming that the simulator\nwas correct\u201d. The risk manager is not going to be able to winkle out all of\nthese implicit conditions at the start of the process, but other climate scien-\ntists might be able to. Thus the elicitation process must be very carefully\nstructured to ensure that, by the time that the experts finally deliver their\nprobabilities, as many as possible of the implicit qualifications have been\nexposed and undone. This usually involves a carefully facilitated group elic-\nitation, typically extending over several days. Interestingly, Tetlock did not\nuse group elicitations in his study, but they are standard in environmental\nscience areas such as natural hazards; see, e.g., Cooke and Goossens (2000),\nAspinall (2010), or Aspinall and Cooke (2012).\nScientists working in climate, and philosophers too we expect, often re-\nceive requests to complete on-line surveys about future climate. These sur-\nveys are desperately flawed by responses missing \u2018not at random\u2019. But even\nwere they not, their results ought to be treated with great circumspection,\ngiven the experience in natural hazards of how much difference a careful\ngroup elicitation can make, in comparing experts\u2019 probabilities at the start\nand at the finish of the process.\n4.2 Own the judgement\nThis is in fact another type of qualification, where the climate scientist does\nnot present his own judgement, but someone else\u2019s. A classic example would\nbe \u201caccording to the recent IPCC report\u201d. As far as the climate scientist is\nconcerned, these qualified uncertainty assessments are consequence-free, and\nthey ought to be judged by the risk manager as worthless, since nothing is\n12\nstaked.\nThe IPCC reports are valuable sources of information, but no one owns\nthe judgements in them. Only a very na\u00a8\u0131ve risk manager would take the IPCC\nassessment reports as their expert, rather than consulting a climate scientist,\nwho had read the reports, and also knew about the culture of climate science,\nand about the IPCC process. This is not to denigrate the IPCC, but simply\nto be appropriately realistic about its sociological and political complexities,\nin the face of the very practical needs of the risk manager. These complexities\nare well-recognised, and a decision by the risk manager to adopt the IPCC\nreports as her expert can hardly be blame-free. As a marketing ploy, the\ndecision to buy IBM computers was said to be blame-free in the 1970s and\n80s: \u201cnobody ever got fired for buying IBM equipment\u201d\u2014how hollow that\nsounds now!\nThe challenge with owning the judgement in climate science is the com-\nplexity of the science itself. There are three main avenues for developing\nquantitative insights about future climate: (i) computer simulation, (ii) con-\ntemporary data collected mainly from field stations, ocean sondes, and satel-\nlites, but also slightly older data from ships\u2019 log-books, and (iii) pal\u00e6oclimate\nreconstruction from archives such as ice and sediment cores, speliothems,\nboreholes, and tree-rings. Each of these is a massive exercise in its own right,\ninvolving large teams of people, large amounts of equipment, and substan-\ntial numerical processing. Judgements about future climate at high spatial\nand temporal resolution come mainly from computer simulation, but one\nmust not forget that these simulators have been tuned and critiqued against\ncontemporary data and, increasingly, pal\u00e6oclimate reconstructions.\nWherever there is a high degree of scientific complexity, there is a large\nopportunity for human error. With computer simulation, an often-overlooked\nopportunity for error is the wrapping of the computational core for a specific\ntask; for example, performing a time-slice experiment for the Mid-Holocene\nat a particular combination of simulator parameter values. Whereas the com-\nputational core of the simulator is used time and again, and one might hope\nthat large errors will have been picked up and corrected and committed back\nto the repository, the wrapper is often used only once. It tends to be poorly\n13\ndocumented, often existing as a loose collection of scripts which are passed\naround from one scientist to another. It is easy to load the wrong initial-\nisation file or boundary file, and also easy to extract the wrong summary\nvalues from the gigabytes of simulator output. \u2018Easy\u2019 in this case equates\nto \u2018if you have done an experiment like this, you will be aware of at least\none mistake that you made, spotted, and corrected\u2019. The correction of this\ntype of mistake can take weeks of effort, as it is tracked backwards from the\nalarming simulator output to its source in the underlying code.\nAt the other end of the modelling spectrum, there are phenomenological\nmodels of low-dimensional properties of climate and its impacts. See, for\nexample, Crucifix (2012), who surveys dynamical models of glacial cycles, or\nLorenz et al. (2012), who study the welfare value of reducing uncertainty, no-\ntably in the presence of a climate tipping point. There are several advantages\nto such models. First, they are small enough to be coded by the scientist\nhimself, and can be carefully checked for code errors. Thus the scientist can\nhimself be fairly sure that the interesting result from his simulator is not an\nartifact of a mistake in the programming. Second, they are often tractable\nenough to permit a formal analysis of their properties. For example, they\nmight be qualitatively classified by type, or explicitly optimised, or might in-\nclude intentional agents who perform sequences of optimisations (such as risk\nmanagers). Third, they are quick enough to execute that they can be run for\nmillions of model years. Hence the scientist can use replications to assimilate\nmeasurements (including tuning the parameters) and to assess uncertainty,\nboth within a statistical framework (e.g., using the sequential approach of\nAndrieu et al., 2010).\nOf course, \u2018big modellers\u2019 will be scornful of the limited physics (biology,\nchemistry, economics, etc.) that these phenomenological models contain, al-\nthough they must be somewhat chastened by the inability of their simula-\ntors to conclusively outperform simple statistical procedures in tasks such\nas ENSO prediction (Barnston et al., 2012). But the real issue is one of\nownership. A single climate scientist cannot own an artifact as complex as\na large-scale climate simulator, and it is very hard for him to make a quan-\ntitative assessment of the uncertainty that is engendered by its limitations.\n14\nWe advocate spending resources on designed experiments to support the cli-\nmate scientist in this assessment, but we also note that a scientist can own\na phenomenological model, and the judgements that follow from its use.\n4.3 Be coherent\nTetlock (2005, p. 7) has a similar requirement. In this context, \u2018coherent\u2019\nhas a technical meaning, which is to say, \u2018don\u2019t make egregious mistakes in\nprobabilistic reasoning\u2019. This needs to be said, because it is more honour\u2019d\nin the breach than the observance.\nFor example, Gigerenzer (2003) provides a vivid account of how doctors,\nwho ought to be good at uncertainty assessment, often struggle with even\nelementary probability calculations, and how this compromises the notion of\ninformed consent to medical procedures. As another example, the \u2018P -value\nfallacy\u2019\u2014inferring that the null hypothesis is false because the P -value is\nsmall\u2014is endemic in applied statistics (see, e.g., Goodman, 1999; Ioannidis,\n2005). It is very similar to the Prosecutor\u2019s fallacy in Law (see, e.g., Gigeren-\nzer, 2003, ch. 9). These fallacies serve to remind us that people are not very\ngood when reasoning about uncertainty, and that they can easily be mislead\nby fallacious arguments (that violate the probability calculus), sometimes\nintentionally.\nTetlock (2005, ch. 4) also notes another aspect of coherence, which is to\nappropriately update opinions in the light of new information. He emphasises\nthe use of Bayes\u2019s Theorem, and demonstrates that his experts did not make\nthe full adjustment that was indicated by Bayesian conditioning. While\nthere are psychological explanations for under-adjustment, we would also\nnote that the probability calculus and Bayesian conditioning is only a model\nfor reasoning about uncertainty, and not the sine qua non.\nProbabilistic inference owes its power to the unreasonable demands of its\naxioms, notably the need to quantify an additive (probability) measure on a\nsufficiently rich field of propositions. This point was very clearly expressed\nby Savage (1954, notably sec. 2.5), in his contrast between the small world\nin which one assesses probabilities and performs calculations, and the grand\n15\nworld in which one makes choices. He writes \u201cI am unable to formulate\ncriteria for selecting these small worlds and indeed believe that their selection\nmay be a matter of judgment and experience about which it is impossible to\nenunciate complete and sharply defined general principles . . . On the other\nhand it is an operation in which we all necessarily have much experience, and\none in which there is in practice considerable agreement\u201d (pp. 16-17).\nA similar point is made by Howson and Urbach (2006, ch. 3), who defend\nprecise probabilities as a model for reasoning against more complex variants\nin terms of \u201cthe explanatory and informational dividends obtained from their\nuse within simplifying models of uncertain inference\u201d (p. 62, original empha-\nsis). Howson and Urbach present an instructive analogy with deductive logic,\nwhose poor representation of implication requires that we use it thoughtfully\nwhen reasoning about propositions that are either true or false (p. 72). Thus\nin reasoning about uncertainty, grand world probabilities will be informed by\nsmall world calculations such as Bayesian conditioning, but need not be syn-\nonymous with them. The Temporal Sure Preference condition of Goldstein\n(1997) provides one way to connect these two worlds (see also Goldstein and\nWooff, 2007, sec. 3.5).\nSo, for climate scientists, and the risk managers they are hoping to im-\npress, the moral of be coherent is that (i) it is very easy to make mistakes\nwhen reasoning about uncertainty, that (ii) strict adherence to the rules of\nthe probability calculus (and perhaps the assistance of a professional statis-\ntician) will minimise these, and that (iii) although probability calculations\nare highly informative, no one should be overly impressed by an uncertainty\nassessment that is a precise implementation of fully probabilistic Bayesian\nconditioning\u2014one would expect this to be simplistic.\n5 Reflection\nSuppose that you were one of a group of climate scientists, interested in\nplaying an active role in climate policy, and able to meet the three strictures\noutlined in section 4. You have all embraced subjective uncertainty, and have\nbeen summoned, willingly, to a carefully facilitated expert elicitation session.\n16\nAfter two intense but interesting days your 95% equi-tailed credible interval\nfor the maximum height of water in the Thames Estuary in 2100 is 0.5m\nto 2.75m higher than today. This is wider than your initial interval, as you\ncame to realise, during the elicitation process, that there were uncertainties\nwhich you had not taken into account.\nSuppose that this has recently happened, and you are reflecting on the\nprocess, and wondering what information might have made a large difference\nto your uncertainty assessment, and that of your fellow experts. In partic-\nular, you imagine being summoned back in the year 2020, to re-assess your\nuncertainties in the light of eight years of climate science progress. Would\nyou be saying to yourself, \u201cYes, what I really need is an ad hoc ensemble\nof about 30 high-resolution simulator runs, slightly higher than today\u2019s res-\nolution.\u201d Let\u2019s hope so, because right now, that\u2019s what you are going to\nget.\nBut we think you\u2019d be saying, \u201cWhat I need is a designed ensemble,\nconstructed to explore the range of possible climate outcomes, through sys-\ntematically varying those features of the climate simulator that are currently\nill-constrained, such as the simulator parameters, and by trying out alterna-\ntive modules with qualitatively different characteristics.\u201d Obviously, you\u2019d\nprefer higher resolution to the current resolution, but you don\u2019t see squeez-\ning another 0.25\u25e6 out of the solver as worth sacrificing all the potential for\nexploring uncertainty inherent in our limited knowledge of the earth system\u2019s\ndynamics, and its critical ecosystems. We\u2019d like to see at least one of the large\nclimate modelling centres commit to providing this information by 2020, on\ntheir current simulator, operating at a resolution that permits hundreds of\nsimulator runs per scenario (a resolution of about 2\u25e6, we hazard). Research\nfunders have the power to make this happen, but for some reason they have\nnot yet perceived the need.\nReferences\nC. Andrieu, A. Doucet, and R. Holenstein, 2010.

In 2003, a majority of states anticipated water shortages over the \nsubsequent decade, even in the absence of drought conditions.5 Water policy \nexperts contend, without exaggeration, that \u201cthe United States is heading \ntoward a water scarcity crisis.\u201d6 \n Global climate change will exacerbate pressures on water resources.7 \nAlthough news reports devote more space to the potential threat of rising \n                                                 \n*  Professor of Law and Director, Center for Business Law & Regulation, Case \nWestern Reserve University School of Law.

As the IPCC has concluded, \n\u201cchanges in water management practices will have a very significant impact \non how climate change affects the water sector.\u201d11 There is \u201cgreat and \narguably unavoidable\u201d uncertainty with regard to future climate change and \nother potential impact on water supplies, including changes in population and \nrelevant technologies.12 More efficient water distribution and allocation \ninstitutions are necessary.

A gradual shift toward \nwater marketing and market pricing will improve the management of water \nsupplies, ensure more efficient allocation of available water supplies, and \nencourage cost-effective conservation measures. \n Part II of this article provides a brief overview of current climate \nchange projections and their expected impact on water supplies and use \npatterns. That climate change will have an effect on water availability is \nquite certain. Yet, the precise outcome of such effects is uncertain. Indeed, \nthe ultimate effect of climate change on water resources is essentially \nunpredictable. This uncertainty increases the need for water institutions that \nare flexible and capable of responding to unanticipated changes in water \nsupplies and demands. \n Part III explains why water markets are an appropriate institutional \nresponse to the particular challenges posed by climate change. Water markets \nhave substantial benefits over traditional, centralized planning and \nadministration, including their flexibility and utilization of decentralized \ninformation. Market-based pricing of water provides additional benefits, \nincluding the creation of incentives for increased efficiency and \nconservation. In short, there is a particularly good match between the \nprimary virtues of water markets and the demands placed on water \ninstitutions by the prospect of climate change.  \n Part IV of the article offers some preliminary thoughts on how to \nmanage the transition to market institutions for water. Like all institutional \narrangements, water markets are not perfect. Further, there are political and \nadministrative obstacles that could impede a move toward greater reliance on \nmarkets for the allocation and pricing of water. Nonetheless, as this section \ndiscusses, water markets have been used to manage water quite effectively in \nmany parts of the world, and could help mitigate the negative impact of \nglobal climate change on water supplies. \n \nII.

Nonetheless, even if there \nwas a sizable chance that human activity is having little impact in \ncomparison to natural fluctuations, the probability of a significant human \nimpact on the climate system is more than sufficient to warrant \npolicymakers\u2019 attention. \nIf climatic projections are correct, some amount of anthropogenic \nwarming is almost certainly inevitable.18 The accumulation of greenhouse \ngases in the atmosphere over the past several decades has ensured some \ndegree of warming over the coming century.19  Political leaders have \nconsidered and debated various emission control policies for decades at the \nnational and international level. Yet an enforceable global, emission-control \nregime remains elusive.20 Even if such a regime was put in place, it is \nexceedingly unlikely that it would impose emission controls or other \nmeasures sufficient to result in a significant reduction of projected \nwarming.21 Policymakers must prepare to deal with the consequences of a \nfuture greenhouse warming today. \nAdaptation to an inevitable warming of the climate and its \nconsequent effects must be a key element of any meaningful climate change \npolicy.

Water rights can be defined in terms of actual water volume, a \nshare of a given water body or water flow, or in terms of the availability of \nwater of a particular quantity at a given place.82 Water rights can also be \nconsumptive or non-consumptive, and may or may not be held subject to the \nrights of third parties or other water right holders.  \n Water markets do not only consist of outright sales of water rights. \nAs water markets evolve over time, potential buyers and sellers develop \ncontracts and instruments to address specific demands and needs. While \noutright transfers of water rights occur, so do various short-term and long-\nterm leases, \u201csale-leasebacks,\u201d83 and option contracts. Where state law \nauthorizes the purchase or lease of instream water flows, conservation \norganizations have negotiated innovative deals with water rights owners in \norder to enhance the habitat value of rivers and streams.84 As the IPCC \nobserved, \u201cWhere feasible, short-term transfers can provide flexibility and \nincreased security for highly valued water uses such as urban supply, and in \nsome circumstances may prove more beneficial than constructing additional \nstorage reservoirs.\u201d85 \n As with property rights in any other saleable good or commodity, \nwater rights are the foundation for water markets and can provide substantial \nincentives for increased efficiency and allocation of rights to their highest \nvalued use. \u201cWaste generally rears its ugly head where a transfer of resources \nis not permitted.\u201d86 Where an individual is using a transferable resource in an \ninefficient or wasteful manner, there is an opportunity for an entrepreneur to \ngain from acquiring the resource and putting it to better use. Where rights to \nwater are transferable, water prices will reflect the value of alternative uses. \nThis gives the rights holder an incentive to allocate the water to its highest \n                                                 \n81  ANDERSON & SNYDER, supra note 4, at 23; see also Brewer et al., supra note \n77, at 1024 (\u201cMost economists agree that an efficient system of property rights requires three \nelements: a complete definition; exclusivity; and transferability.\u201d); RICHARD L.

Combined with the fact that property rights \nin land have been more well-defined and defended than rights in water, \nfarmers have more incentive to improve the efficiency of land use than to \nfocus on efficient water use, and to use water or irrigated land as a substitute \nfor dry land in the production of crops.90 Between 1910 and 2000, the \namount of crop land in the United States declined by three percent, despite \nincreased food demand, due to increases in per acre productivity.91 At the \nsame time, water withdrawals for irrigation increased 251 percent and the \namount of irrigated land increased by over 350 percent.92 In short, this period \nsaw dramatic increases in agricultural land-use productivity, while water-use \nproductivity stagnated.93 \nSimply allowing farmers to sell their water rights to \u201cthirsty cities\u201d \nwould provide substantial incentives to increase water use efficiency in the \nagricultural sector.94 The result is a win-win situation: the farmer receives \npayment for giving up water rights that he no longer needs and the \u201cthirsty \ncity\u201d gets water that it would otherwise not have (or need to pay even more \nto obtain). The possibility of a voluntary transaction increases efficiency and \nproduces gains for buyer and seller alike. The potential for such transfers is \nquite large: \u201cIt is estimated that 80 percent of consumptive use (CU) of water \nin the arid west of the United States is from agriculture, and irrigated land \nincreased from 3.5 million acres in 1950 to 15 million acres in 1990 . . . .\u201d95 \nFurther, \u201c[i]n the western USA, water-market transactions and other \n                                                 \n87  See Holden & Thobani, supra note 73, at 11 (\u201cTradable water rights allow the \nprice of water to reflect the value of its alternative uses, which creates incentives to put it to \nthe most productive use.\u201d). \n88  Morriss, et al., supra note 86, at 336 (\u201cWater markets create incentives for \nconservation by offering water rights holders the potential to sell the water they conserve.\u201d). \n89  Jedidiah Brewer, Robert Glennon, Alan Ker, & Gary Libecap, Water Markets \nin the West: Prices, Trading and Contractual Forms (Feb. 2007) (unpublished discussion \npaper, filed as no. 07-07 with the Arizona Legal Studies Department). \n90  Indur M.

As the IPCC itself has noted: \nIf water supplies decline in particular locations or seasons, \nwater markets could soften the impacts by moving water \nfrom lower to higher valued uses. In the western United \nStates, where irrigation now accounts for more than 80% of \nconsumptive water use, water market activity is likely to \ncontinue the current trend of movement of water out of \nirrigated agriculture to accommodate other water uses.97 \nWith water markets, buyers and sellers of water rights get to \ndetermine what water is worth to them, and make decisions about whether to \nengage in voluntary transfers accordingly. Where transfers occur, it is \nbecause a buyer values the water more than the seller. Thus, water transfers \nreallocate water rights from lower value uses to higher value uses, producing \na more efficient allocation of the resource. Insofar as some users, or would-\nbe water users, hold particularly idiosyncratic value preferences, these are \nalso incorporated into the price, as water rights are only transferred when \nboth buyer and seller agree.  \n \nB. Prices and Information \n \nPrices are an essential component of working markets.98 Price \nsignals and the potential to profit from differences in valuation provide \npowerful incentives for innovation. Those who uncover ways to facilitate \ntrades or increase efficiency can profit from such discoveries. Price signals \nprovide powerful incentives for conservation while simultaneously \ncommunicating information about collective judgments about the relative \nscarcity of resources across time and space.  \nPrices enable markets to operate as a powerful coordination \nmechanism. Prices communicate information about the relative scarcity of \ngoods and services in various places, and the valuation placed upon the good \nfor current and alternative uses.99 As market conditions fluctuate, market \nprices change accordingly. As environmental economist Richard Stroup \nexplains, \u201cmarket prices adjust constantly to all of the supply and demand \nvariables, providing each buyer and each seller with up-to-date information \n                                                 \n96  CLIMATE CHANGE 2007: WGII, supra note 15, at 198. \n97  Id. at 748. \n98  See generally STROUP, supra note 81, at 27-29. \n99  Morriss, supra note 80, at 979 (\u201cWhen we observe a market price, we have a \nremarkably compact source of fairly dense information.\u201d). \n744 HAMLINE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 31:3 \non changes in relative values in the world around them.\u201d100 This function is \nperformed in a hyper-efficient manner, particularly in comparison to \nadministrative mechanisms that seek to measure relative scarcity, and \nenables market participants to take account of changing market conditions \nwithout specific knowledge about such conditions. Such information is \ncommunicated in the market price. \n Through the price system, markets incorporate and account for far \nmore information than centralized administrative entities, and at far less \ncost.101 This is important because information is both extremely valuable, \nand quite costly to uncover and accumulate.102 \u201cBy conveying the alternative \nvaluations of resources, prices enable market actors to compare their present \nuse of a resource to the potential use others might make of it without \nknowing the details of those potential uses.\u201d103 Accumulating and processing \nthe same volume of information through an administrative process would be \nexceedingly costly, and would be difficult (if not impossible) to achieve in as \ntimely a fashion. \nA regulatory system that seeks to limit the amount of water used for \nvarious purposes to \u201cappropriate\u201d amounts would require the collection and \nconsideration of myriad amounts of information concerning the relevant \ninformation about how water is and could be used within various industries \nin different places and at different times. Such efforts rarely succeed as \nplanned because centralized decision-makers are not able to collect and \nprocess a sufficient volume of information.104 An adaptive system, such as is \nrequired to respond adequately to the threat of climate change, is even more \ninformation intensive.105 A market system, in which users pay for the \nresource that they use, enables individual water users to weigh the trade-off \nbetween the cost of obtaining additional water, the cost of reducing or \nconserving water use, and other relevant factors.

In this fashion, market \ninstitutions \u201cencourage individuals to adapt to changed circumstances.\u201d108 \nMarkets also quickly incorporate \u2013 and market prices reflect \u2013 changing \nvalues and increased knowledge about a particular resource.

As a general matter, water prices are below prices that \nwould prevail in competitive markets.112 As Professor Glennon laments, \u201cthe \nprice of water in the United States is ridiculously low.\u201d113 In some cities, \nthere is little charge for water, and water use is not even measured.114 Even \n                                                 \n107  Morriss, supra note 80, at 974. \n108  Id. at 988. \n109  Williams James Smith, Jr. & Young-Doo Wang, Conservation Rates: The Best \n\u2018New\u2019 Source of Urban Water During Drought, WATER & ENV\u2019T J.

However price responsiveness \nvaried seasonally. In particular, aggregate demand was 25% more price \nresponsive in the summer months, reflecting the more discretionary nature of \noutdoor water use.\u201d125 \nIncreased efficiency can have a dramatic effect on water use \npatterns. Water use can vary significantly by locality, even within regions. \nFor example, the average resident of Los Angeles uses approximately 125 \ngallons of water per day, whereas the average resident of Tucson only uses \n114 gallons.126 Surprisingly enough, the United States, as a whole, uses less \nwater today than it did 25 years ago, according to Peter Gleick of the Pacific \nInstitute. 127 \nWater usage rates vary substantially within individual industries.128 \nIn the residential sector, strikingly different water use patterns emerge based \non how water is priced. Professor Glennon reports that per capita water use is \napproximately 300 gallons per day in Fresno, California, where water use is \nnot metered.129 In the neighboring community of Clovis, however, water is \nmetered, and per capita water use is thirty three percent lower.130 In the \n1970s, price increases and other measures reduced the average peak daily \nwater demand by approximately 20 percent.131 \nIn agriculture, where the potential for water use savings may be \ngreatest, price increases create incentives for producers to \u201csubstitute labor \nand capital for water,\u201d and use more efficient, and less water-intensive, \nirrigation techniques.132 Forced to pay the market value of water, many \nagricultural users may sell their water to other users who can better afford its \nhigher cost. These agricultural users would also find conservation measures \nto be better investments than before, particularly if they could sell any \nconserved water.133 \u201cRate increases would encourage the elimination of \nmarginal economic activities and the movement of water toward more \nproductive uses,\u201d and encourage technological innovation as well.134 \nAllowing water prices to fluctuate with changes in supply and \ndemand would likely force many consumers to pay significantly more for \nwater, particularly in areas where water is heavily subsidized.

The precise scope, timing and \nlocation of its effect on water supplies are uncertain. The range of potential \neffects in any given place is quite large. Traditional planning tools are poorly \nequipped to address climatic effects on water supplies. \u201cEven under the \npresumption of a stable climate, imprecise hydrologic information is now \nfrequently at the heart of costly conflicts over proposed water transfers and \nnew water developments.\u201d145 As Kenneth Frederick of Resources for the \nFuture explains, \u201cto plan for and justify expensive new projects when the \nmagnitude, timing, and even the direction of the changes are unknown . . . \nBuilding for changes that never materialize or failing to build facilities to \ndeal with changes that do occur are both potentially costly.\u201d146 Those \nadministrative agencies tasked with water management have been quite timid \nin modernizing or reforming their management strategies to account for \ncurrent and projected stresses on water supplies, and have done little to \nprepare for the threat of climate change.147 As the IPCC further concluded, \n\u201cwater planners need to recognize that it is not possible to resolve all \nuncertainties, so it would not be wise to base decisions on only one, or a few, \nclimate model scenarios. Rather, making use of probabilistic assessments of \nfuture hydrological changes may allow planners to better evaluate risks and \nresponse options.\u201d148 Such uncertainty also highlights the need for flexible \nand adaptive water management institutions. \nWater markets can both reduce uncertainty for water users and \nprovide security against the harms that uncertainty can produce.149 If water \nusers are able to purchase additional water rights from other users, this can \n                                                 \n143  See Renwick & Green, supra note 118, at 38.

The value of flexibility is reflected in the \nincreasing numbers of market transfers of water rights \nthroughout the region and in efforts to devise new \nmechanisms to facilitate short-term transfers of water \nentitlements.153 \nFlexibility helps water users accommodate potential risks to water supplies, \nand is quite valuable as a result. \nThe ability to transfer water rights in advance of potential supply \nchanges also enables water users to reallocate the risk of uncertainty.154 \nWater users can acquire options that will enable them to obtain water \nnecessary to address unanticipated changes in future supply. As in \ncommodity markets, such options are an important risk management \ninstrument. This \u201cability of markets to \u2018shift\u2019 uncertainty is important both \nbecause the law might mistakenly misallocate the burden of uncertainty and \nbecause the government cannot always determine who can best bear the \nburden\u201d of uncertainty or unanticipated losses.155 As compared to \nadministrative allocations, markets are a far superior, and far more flexible \nand adaptable, means of accommodating uncertainty. As Professor Morriss \nexplains: \nWater use, even if optimized today, must change tomorrow \nto remain optimal. A planned solution is thus unable to \nremain optimal without continual readjustment. Market \nsolutions, on the other hand, allow for continuous \nadjustment without central intervention. Reaching a planned \noptimum requires a great deal of information to be available \n                                                 \n150  Id. at 133. \n151  See id. at 135. \n152  Thompson, supra note 69, at 1. \n153  Miller, Rhodes & MacDonnell, supra note 7, at 162. \n154  Thompson, supra note 149, at 134. \n155  Id. \n2008] WATER MARKETING 751  \nto the planner. Markets, by contrast, allow decentralized \nprocessing of information.156 \n \nIV. THE MOVE TO MARKETS \n \nIt may well be that the most efficient systems of water markets \nevolve over time and cannot simply be imposed from above by government \nfiat.157 Yet there are still several steps government agencies can take to \nfacilitate the development of water markets and greater reliance upon market \ninstitutions in the allocation and management of water resources. The steps \ninclude 1) defining, and recognizing the security and transferability of \nproperty rights in water resources; 2) eliminating government subsidies for \nwater use and distribution; 3) moving toward market-based prices for water; \nand 4) identifying and reducing legal and regulatory barriers to water \ntransfers, particularly interbasin and interstate water transfers.158 \nExisting obstacles to water markets include regulatory barriers, \n\u201cinconsistent legal paradigms, opposition by government agencies that \ncontrol much of the water and key transportation facilities, and to a growing \nextent, concerns about the impact of transfers on exporting communities.\u201d159 \nState rules that limit the lease and sale of water unduly obstruct the \ndevelopment of efficient water markets.160 Many regulatory jurisdictions \ndeliberately inhibit water transfers outside of their jurisdiction.161 The threat \nof administrative expropriation can also discourage private investments that \nwould facilitate water transfers.162 Overall, the more governmental agencies \nare involved in water distribution and allocation, the greater the obstacles to \nwater markets.163 \n The single most important step administrative agencies and law-\nmaking bodies can take is to recognize and protect water rights so as to \nprovide the institutional foundation upon which water markets may be built \nor evolve. As Professor Thompson observes, \u201cBy providing the legal \ninfrastructure for water markets and actively encouraging such markets, the \ngovernment can help reduce the harm from uncertainty in water rights and \n                                                 \n156  Morriss, supra note 74, at 933. \n157  ANDERSON & SNYDER, supra note 4, at 13 (\u201cIt is unlikely that the institutions \nnecessary for a well-functioning market can be imposed through a central government.\u201d). \n158  See CLAY J.

In some cases, water transfers are simply too costly to \ncomplete due to transportation or other transaction costs. Where there are no \nlegal or institutional barriers to such trades, however, the potential for a \nwealth-maximizing trade creates incentives for would-be entrepreneurs to \nuncover ways of lowering such transaction costs so as to make a deal. This \ndoes not mean other concerns should be ignored. Special accommodations \nmay have to be made for water markets to adequately take account of \ninstream flows and sensitive biological resources.170 But such \naccommodations should be made in the context of water markets, and such \nconcerns should not be an excuse to forestall market reforms. Indeed, water \nmarkets have substantial environmental benefits, including increasing \nopportunities for conservation organizations to directly influence water \nallocation decisions as market participants.171 In many places, \n\u201cenvironmental interests have actively supported improved transferability of \n                                                 \n164  Thompson, supra note 149, at 125. \n165  Huffman, supra note 162, at 31. \n166  Thompson, supra note 149, at 132. \n167  Charles W.

Only in the \nabsence of water markets are such losses compounded by the public harms \nresulting from inefficient water allocation and waste.  \n One transitional measure that has shown much promise is the \nimplementation of water banks to facilitate regional transfers. A water bank \nessentially operates as a clearinghouse to facilitate the rental of surplus water \nwhere it is needed. Among the benefits of water banks is that they can reduce \nthe transaction costs associated with contracting for water transfers.174 \nFurther, transfers conducted through water banks \u201cclash less with the public \nresource paradigm\u201d and existing regulatory institutions than do pure, open-\nmarket transfers of water.175 California has had positive experiences with the \nuse of water banks. In the 1970s, a temporary federal water bank helped \nalleviate drought impacts.176 In the 1990s, the California Department of \nWater Resources created water banks that efficiently reallocated large \nvolumes of water among both public and private users.177 Water banks have \nbeen used in Idaho as well.178 \n \n \nV. CONCLUSION \n \n Climate change presents many challenges, but it also presents \nopportunities. In the case of water, the need to prepare for the impact of \nclimatic warming creates an opportunity to improve on existing institutions. \nIn particular, the threat of climate change could provide the long-needed \nimpetus to shift away from centralized political management of water \nresources, toward market-based institutions. Such a shift holds the potential \nto increase the efficiency and environmental soundness of water use in the \nUnited States.  \n                                                 \n172  Miller et al., supra note 7, at 162. \n173  See STROUP, supra note 81, at 7-9 (noting that market exchange encourages \npositive sum interactions). \n174  Thompson, supra note 69, at 10. \n175  Id. \n176  Frederick, supra note 141, at 150. \n177  Howe, supra note 167, at 87. \n178  Frederick, supra note 141, at 151. \n754 HAMLINE LAW REVIEW [Vol. 31:3 \nClimate change is ultimately a problem about environmental risk, \nalbeit a very large risk.

    "abstract": "Climate change is likely to have substantial effects on irrigated agriculture. Extreme climate events such as droughts are likely to become more common. These patterns are evident in median projections of climate change for the Murray\u2013Darling Basin in Australia. Understanding climate change effects on returns from irrigation involves explicit representation of spatial changes in natural stocks (i.e. water supply) and their temporal variability (i.e. frequency of drought states of nature) and the active management responses to capital stocks represented by mitigation and alternative adaptation strategies by state of nature . A change in the frequency of drought will induce a change in the allocation of land and water between productive activities. In this paper, a simulation model of state-contingent production is used to analyze the effects of climate change adaptation and mitigation. In the absence of mitigation, climate change will have severe adverse effects on irrigated agriculture in the Basin. However, a combination of climate mitigation and adaptation through changes in land and water use will allow the maintenance of agricultural water use and environmental flows.Irrigation, Uncertainty, Climate Change",

However,  the \nsuggested  rules  released  for  the  Scheme  leave  room  to  continue  commenting  and  to \nobjectively analyse the potential intended and unintended implications these policy changes \ncould have on society.  \n \nIt is proposed to include reforestation on a voluntary basis from Scheme\u2019s commencement in \n2010 (DDC, 2008). Under the Scheme, accredited forestry entities will be issued permits for \neach tonne of net greenhouse gas removed from the atmosphere depending on the purpose \nfor  forest  grown  (DCC,  2008).  Obligations,  such  as  stand  maintenance  and  reporting, \nagainst forest entities will apply for a defined period, e.g. 70 years following the issue of the \nlast permit for an individual forest (DCC, 2008). As there will be competition about the limited \nnumber of permits on the emission market, forest entities will be able to sell their permits to \nother market participants that require permits in order to account for their greenhouse gas \nreleases.  The  sale  of  permits  will  generate  some  kind  of  income  for  the  forest  entities \nparticipating  in  the  system.  Though,  the  income  will  highly  depend  on  estimated  local \nsequestration  rates,  the  carbon  price  (DDC,  2008)  and  the  costs  of  establishing  and \nmaintaining a forest. Under this climate change mitigation policy reforestation may become \nan attractive alternative to current production systems. \n \nHowever,  forests  allow  less  surface  water  runoff  and  groundwater  recharge  than  annual \ncrops and pasture per unit area (Parsons et al., 2007). This is due to higher transpiration; \ninterception and evaporation predominantly caused by rougher and denser canopy, longer \ngrowing  periods  and  deeper  root systems (Zhang  et  al.,  2003;  Farley  et  al.,  2005). The \neffects  of  increased  water  interception  are  complex  as  reforestation  impact  on  reduced \nrunoff  is  highly  depended  on  local  characteristics  such  as  rainfall,  soil,  slope, \nevapotranspiration as well as tree species and management, with mean annual rainfall being \nthe  dominate factor (Zhang  et  al., 2001).  Research  on  water  interception  in  the  Murray-\nDarling Basin (hereafter, the Basin) due to forest plantation suggests that the runoff can \ndecrease by up to 1.6 to 2.5 ML/ha (Young et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2001). \n \nIncreased interception will need to be considered in water allocation regimes (Young et al., \n2009,  Zhang  et  al.,  2001).  Inappropriate  forest  planning  management  and  regulatory \nmeasures could lead to a situation where significant amounts of water currently allocated to \nirrigators  and  the  environment  could  be  expected  to  be  permanently  removed  from  the \nsystem as landholders plant trees in order to gain carbon permits (Young et al. 2009). Under \nclimate change scenarios as projected for the Basin in the Garnaut Review (Garnaut, 2008; \nQuiggin et al., 2008) the impact on water availability could even further exacerbate (Zhang et \nal., 2003).  \n \nThe aim of this study is to investigate the carbon price signal required for turning agricultural \nland in the south-eastern catchments of the Basin into commercially forested land. Further, \nwe aim to demonstrate the impact of a positive carbon price signal on land use changes \nwhen  forestry  is  accounted  for  under  a  water  allocation  regime.  In  particular,  we  will \ninvestigate the impact on the Basin\u2019s overall production water yield and economic return \nunder baseline and climate change conditions as projected by Garnaut (2008). To achieve \nthis, section 2 outlines the data and assumptions employed to examine the profitability and \nspatial  suitability  of  timber  production  within  the  Basin.  The  model  used  to  simulate \nimplications  of  potential  carbon  price  signals  on  water  availability  in  the  Basin  will  be \ndescribed  in  section  3.  The  results  are  presented  and  discussed  in  section  4  before \nconcluding comments and the implications from the study are presented in section 5.  \n \n2  Data and Assumptions   \n \nThis study examines the Basin wide impacts on water availability and economic return from \npotential forest plantations in the south-eastern catchments under alternative hypothetical \ncarbon prices. The south-eastern catchments are defined as the: Murrumbidgee, Murray (1-\n3)\n3, North East, Goulburn-Broken and North Central. These are the high rainfall catchments \n(see Fig.1) that predominately determine the volume and quality of water available for the \nenvironment, potable urban supplies and irrigation within the southern Basin.  \n \n \nFigure 1: Average rainfall in south-eastern catchments of the Murray-Darling Basin \nSource: Data based on BOM, 2008 \n \nWe assume that a minimum rainfall of 600 mm per year is required as the natural threshold \nto grow  trees\n4.  Should this  threshold  not  be met,  we  have  assumed that  supplementary \nirrigation of trees (either directly or indirectly  via the root system) up to this threshold is \nrequired to maintain tree growth. This supplementary irrigation is then accounted for under \nthe cap on water extractions.   \n \nThe Australian government expects that most forest establishments as result of the Scheme \nwill  be  not-for-harvest  forests  grown  on  marginal  or  less  productive  land,  rather  than \nplantations (DCC, 2008).  However, in this study we assume that forest entities participating \nin  the  Scheme  have  an  economical  incentive  to  realise  income  from  carbon  and  timber \nproduction rather than from carbon yield only.  \n \nConsequently,  we  suppose  that  price  signals may  provide  an  incentive  for forests to  be \nestablished  on  productive  land  to  take  advantage  of  increased  timber  growth  and  CO2 \nabsorption compared to the slower timber growth and sequestration rates from marginal land \n(based on Zhang et al. 2001). This is illustrated in Table 1 where lower rainfall is equated \n                                                           \n3 A subdivision of the Murray catchment has been undertaken to allow for greater accuracy of \nmodelling water flows within the Basin.  \n4 Assumption based on minimum rainfall required to grow radiate pine: 600 mm/year and for \neucalyptus: 700 mm/year (VIC DPI.a, 2003; VIC DPI.b, 2008). \nLegend\nMDB River System\nRainfall\nNot examined\n301 - 400 mm\n401 - 600 mm\n601 - 800 mm\n> 801 mm \n \nwith  reduced  CO2  absorption  rates.  It  is  likely  that  environmental  plantings  under  the \nScheme  may  take  place  under  circumstances  where  opportunity  costs  allow  for  a \nsubstitution of activity; however, this is not the focus of this study.  \n \nAccording to the Schemes suggestions, carbon sequestration in a forest that is harvested is \nassumed to be lower on average than for a never harvested forest (DCC, 2008). Table 1 \nillustrates information about catchment based site conditions included in this study. \n \nThe estimated sequestration rates for a 30 year rotation are projected from Fortunaso\u2019s et al. \n(2007)  model.  This  model  provides  us  with  the  capacity  to  simulate  the  annual  CO2 \nabsorption per hectare as land use changes from agricultural to commercial plantings for \neach catchment in the Basin. This CO2 sequestration then defines the parameters for the \nnumber of permits issued to each forest entities per hectare as stipulated under the Scheme \n(DCC,  2008)  where  total  abatement  permits  equals  the  projected  net  greenhouse  gas \nremoval. \n \nTable 1: Rainfall, soil and carbon sequestration rates in the south-eastern catchments of the \nBasin \nCMA  Ave historic \nrainfall (mm/year)  Soil types (mostly) \ntCO2/ha (Ave) \nunder 30 year \nstand \nMurray 1  654  Sodosol, Kurosol \nDermosol, Chromosol  239 \nMurray 2  410  Sodosol  117 \nMurray 3  387  Sodosol, Vertosol  130 \nMurrumbidgee  528  Chromosol  208 \nNorth East   835  Sodosol, Chromosol  302 \nGoulburn-Broken  618  Sodosol  210 \nNorth Central  556  Sodosol, Chromosol  209 \nSources: tCO2/ha based on Fortunaso et al.

Obviously \nproduction, capital and maintenance costs for forests will differ considerably between small \nand large scale operations and catchments and therefore should be used as a guide only.  \nWe assume that costs and timber prices will remain constant over time and scale.  \n \nThe  White  Paper  suggests  that  production  risk  (e.g.  fire)  should  be  accounted  for  in  a \nreversal buffer to be deducted from each permit in order to account for possible disturbances \nto the net greenhouse gas removed (DCC, 2008). We neglected this buffer to simplify our \ncalculation  but  acknowledge  that  this  would  diminish  income  from  carbon  sequestration. \nPotentially  in  the  future  this  could  be  treated  as  a  fixed  cost  (i.e.  annual  insurance)  but \ncurrently this is not available on the market. \n \nBased on Zhang et al. (2001) and Young et al. (2009) it is estimated that each hectare of \ntrees  planted  will  reduce  runoff  by  2  ML/ha  and  on  top  of  this  regions  that  require \nsupplementary  irrigation  are  also  accounted  for  in  Table  2  to  provide  the  total  water \nrequirements per hectare. To account for decreased annual rainfall in a dry state of nature, \nthe estimated water use doubles to sustain growth. \n \nBased on an estimated water use per tonne of CO2 sequestered for each catchment, we \nbriefly analysed the break-even price for water for hypothetical carbon prices. This break-\neven water price can be interpreted as the price at which emission policy implications are  \n \nneutral in its impact on forestry relative to the case of free water and no carbon price. A \nwater price above the calculated prices presented in Table 2 would not encourage carbon \nfarming under the given settings. The results reveal that break-even prices vary significantly \ndepending on the water use per catchment.  \n \nTable 2: Break-even water price \nCMA \nEstimated \nyield \n(tCO2/ha) \nWater \nuse \n(ML/ha) \nEstimated water \nuse (ML) per tC02 \nsequestered \nBreak-even \nwater price for \n$25 carbon \nprice \nBreak-even \nwater price \nfor $50 \ncarbon price \nBreak-even \nwater price \nfor $100 \ncarbon price \nMurray 1  7.88  2.00  0.25  $98  $197  $394 \nMurray 2  7.16  3.90  0.54  $46  $92  $184 \nMurray 3  7.16  4.13  0.58  $43  $87  $173 \nMurrumbidgee  7.16  2.72  0.38  $66  $132  $264 \nNorth East   10.31  2.00  0.19  $129  $258  $515 \nGoulburn-Broken  7.40  2.00  0.27  $93  $185  $370 \nNorth Central  7.16  2.45  0.34  $73  $146  $292 \nSource: tCO2/ha based on Fortunaso et al.

(2008). These projections are presented in \nTable  B  in  the  Appendix.  According  to  these  estimates,  all  catchments  will  experience \nreduced inflows. It has been assumed that the cap on water extractions is proportionally \nchanged to match reductions in inflows.  \n \n4  Model and Methodology  \n \nThis analysis is a modified application of the state contingent Murray-Darling Basin Model \ndocumented in Adamson et al. (2007). The model simulates land and water allocations for \nirrigation production systems operating under alternative irrigation property rights (Adamson \net al. 2006).  \n \nThe model can be solved using a sequential model solution concept. The sequential model \nsolution  derives  the  allocation  that  maximises  returns  in  one  catchment,  subject  to \nconstraints and then progresses to the next catchment. This evaluation aims to maximise the \nbenefit of individuals in each catchment from using irrigation water as subject to a series of \nconstraints on the use of water, land and labour.  \n \nThe model uses linear programming to maximise the economic return for the Basin at a \nCatchment Management Authority scale for 19 catchments, Adelaide and a the Coorong and \nfor  24  major  commodities  in  three  states  of  nature  (normal,  dry  and  wet).  The  Murray \ncatchment  was  divided  into  three  sub-catchments  to  achieve  a  smaller  scale  spatial \nresolution. The last two catchments allow for the representation of water quality arriving at \nAdelaide and a proxy value for environmental flows presented by the Coorong.  \n \nThe  model  in  its  unmodified  state  optimises  economic  return  by  choosing  between  23 \nproduction systems that use alternative levels of inputs and delivery differing outputs that \nrespond to the availability of land, labour, capital, water volume and water quality (salinity) by \nthree states of nature. In the model, salt levels are constrained by the end-of-valley salinity \ntargets (MDBC, 2005). We introduced harvest forests as proposed under the Scheme as \nproduction system (carbon and timber) in the model using data provided in Table A in the  \n \nAppendix. We use alternative prices for carbon which demonstrate incentives for potential \nland use changes.  \n \nThe state contingent approach chosen in this model recognises that individuals adapt to \nchanging  conditions  as  the  season  changes.  Therefore,  the  model  describes  three \nproduction types (normal, dry and wet) of each major commodity under the possible states of \nnature. \n \nThe model assumes a directed water flow network that incorporates state contingent water \nflows. Water inflow in each catchment is determined by: natural runoff, any transfers to the \ncatchment (e.g. Snowy River) and reflow from upstream water use minus natural loss and \nseepage. In our analysis we focus on natural inflows.  \n \nThe two hypothetical scenarios for this study are set as following. First, we will simulate a \nbase case which will reflect the current situation in which no climate change condition occurs \nand no additional forestry is taking place in the Basin (Scenario 1: Reference case).  \n \nThe second scenario (Scenario 2: Reforestation accounted for in water entitlement regimes) \nwill investigate impact of forest plantations as included in water entitlement regimes. This \nassumes that forest entities will need to account for water that is intercepted by trees and as \nwell as for water that may be required for irrigation in low rainfall areas.  \n \nUnder alternative carbon price signals we will be able to analyse the impacts of potential \nland  use  changes  in  favour  of  forestry  on  overall  water  availability  in  the  Basin  under \nbaseline or current and climate change conditions. The water yields, salt projections and \neconomic values of land and water use on a catchment and end of Basin level retrieved from \nthese settings will be the basis for our discussion.   \n \n5  Results and Discussion  \n \nIn this study, we have simulated five cases that differ in carbon prices ranging from $25 to \n$100  and  compared  the  current  baseline  climate  conditions  to  climate  change  impacts. \nThese simulations allowed for quantification of the area of land changed into harvest forest \nunder  different  assumptions.  On this  basis,  we  projected  the  CO2  sequestration  and  the \noverall changes in water flow and in economic values expected to be observed in the chosen \ncatchments.  Subsequently,  we  discuss  the  carbon  price  signal  required  for  turning \nagricultural land into forestry in the south-eastern catchments and subsequent effects of land \nchange on water availability and economic return. \n \nFigure  2:  Land  area  turned  in  to  forestry  under  alternative  carbon  prices  and  climate \nconditions.  \n \nIn general, land currently used for agriculture will be turned into harvest forests when carbon \nprices reach a level at which profit margins from forestry exceed those from conventional \nfarming. Our simulations show no change in land use at a carbon price of $25 per tonne of \nCO2 sequestered and only very small new forestry at a carbon price of $50 per tonne of CO2 \n(Fig. 2). A significant change in land use in favour of carbon forestry can be expected when \nassuming a price of $100 with a total of 1.14 million hectare being newly established for tree \nplantations in examined catchments (Fig. 2). Under climate change conditions and a carbon \nprice of $100, the area of land converted to forestry will reach 530,000 hectares which is \nonly half of what we see for the same price at normal climate conditions (Fig. 2). A possible \nexplanation for the decline is that the additional irrigation under dry climate as simulated in \nour model considerably impairs the profitability of forestry in comparisons to alternative land \nuse making it less attractive for land change.  \n \nFigure 3: Estimated annual carbon sequestration under alternative carbon prices and climate \nconditions \n \nAnnual carbon sequestration rates are altered proportional to the area turned into forested \nland (Fig. 3). At a carbon price of $25 and $50 no or insignificant low amounts of greenhouse \ngases, respectively, is expected to be sequestered (Fig. 3). However, when forested land is \nestablished on a large scale at a carbon price of $100, total estimated sequestration rates for \nthe examined catchments will rise to 7.03 MtCO2 (Fig. 3). Sequestration rates under climate \nchange and at $100 carbon price are expected to be below normal climate setting reaching \n3.92 MtCO2 (Fig. 3). Compared to Australia\u2019s total emissions in 2006 which amounted to 576 \nMtCO2 (DCC, 2008) these sequestration results appear insignificantly small.  \n \nHowever,  a  carbon  price  of  $50  represents  the  lower  limit  for  a  positive  price  signal  on \ncarbon sequestration from forestry under the current climate conditions in the catchments \nincluded in this study. \n \n  \n \n \nFigure  4:  Production  water  and  flow  to  sea  under  alternative  carbon  prices  and  climate \nconditions \n \nRedesignation of farming land into forests ultimately affects the water flow in a river system \nas discussed in the introduction chapter.  \n \nIn our model, production water available and environmental flows at the end of the Basin \nremain  unchanged  at  10,944  GL  and  5,365  GL  respectively  at  a  carbon  price  of  $25 \ncompared to the reference case which sets the no forestry scenario at in baseline climate \nconditions (Fig. 4). Consistent with the land use data, only minor changes to the Basin\u2019s \nwater yields occur at $50. At a $100 carbon price, the water available for irrigated production \ndecrease significantly to 7,484 GL as a consequence of reduced run off from expanding \nforestry (Fig. 4). As assumed for the simulations, irrigation is required in areas that lack \nsufficient annual rainfall in order to sustain the timber growth. A growing number of tree \nplantations, hence, reduces the run off further and increases salinity violating the end of \ncatchments  thresholds.  This  leads  to  severe  consequences  for  Mallee  and  SA  MDB \ncatchments as well as Adelaide in the modelling outcome. Water quality in the upstream \nneighbouring catchments will degrade so rigorously that no flow will be remaining available \nfor agricultural production use (see Table C in Appendix). Accordingly, water of insufficient \nquality for agricultural production remains in the systems and increases water flows to the \nsea to 7,628 GL in the $100 simulation (Fig. 4).  \n \nThe climate change scenarios at a $100 carbon price leads to a minor reduction of the \nproduction water available compared to unchanged climate conditions, leaving 7,131 GL in \nthe system (Fig. 4). Although overall rainfall declines under climate change, a cut back in \nforestry  dampens  the  negative  effect  of  increasing  drought  to  the  production  water \navailability. Yet, the climate change effect still accounts for the decreased environmental \nflows which drops to 5,375 GL compared to current climate simulations (Fig. 4). \n \nIt should be noted that the model results may not truly reflect reality as future production \nsystems  are  likely  to  adjust  to  an  opportunistic  pattern  to  take  advantage  of  irrigation \nsupplies that will not violate the end of catchment salinity constraints.  Presently these future \nproduction systems are not represented in the modelling work for the lower catchments in \nthe Basin.   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nFigure 5: Economic return under alternative carbon prices and climate conditions \n \nA land use change from current production patterns to forestry is valued as not profitable at \na  $25  carbon  price  in  our  model.  At  this  price,  the  total  economic  return  of  the  Basin \nconsequently remains unchanged at $2.6 billion in comparison to the reference scenario \n(Fig. 5). The minor acre redesignations as predicted for a hypothetical $50 carbon price \nexhibit negligible alterations in economic values for the Basin when compared to the $25 \nscenario (Fig. 5). However, the economic return declines considerably to $2.1 billion at a \n$100 carbon price with forestry now contributing for over 50% or $1.1 billion of the total \nreturn (Fig. 5). The likely explanation for this major decrease is that catchments at the end of \nthe Basin are forced to cut down on irrigation when confronted with reduced amounts of \nproduction water under this scenario (see Table C in the Appendix). Their contribution to the \neconomic value will, therefore, shrink; a loss which cannot be compensated by increased \nincome from high carbon prices. \n \nOverall, the lowest economic return from the Basin with only $1.9 billion is estimated for a \n$100 carbon price under climate change conditions (Fig. 5). This result can be attributed to \nless inflow available initially and to forested land exacerbating water availability and quality in \nthe Basin, even though to a lesser extend as under the current climate simulation. Forestry \nand agriculture account for $0.5 and $0.4 billion, respectively of the total economic value \n(Fig. 5). The decline in land used for forestry and the relatively high amounts of production \nwater  available  despite  reduced  overall  rainfall  may  explain  why  the  contribution  from \nagriculture is higher under climate change than in the $100 normal climate scenario. \n \n5  Conclusion  \n \nOur analysis demonstrates the potential impacts of a voluntary inclusion of forestry in the \nCarbon Pollution Reduction Scheme in the south-eastern catchments for the Murray-Darling \nBasin  under  alternative  carbon  prices.  We  assumed  that  for-harvest  forestry  is  only \neconomically  viable  on  productive  land  rather  than  on  less  productive  land  in  order  to \nachieve high carbon and timber yields. \n \nThe results of this study demonstrate that a carbon price less than $50 per tonne CO2 will \nnot  be  a  sufficient  price  signal  for  land  users  in  the  examined  catchments  to  turn  from \nagricultural production to forested land.  \n \nUnder the study\u2019s assumption, a price for carbon of $100 per tonne will result in large scale \nforest plantations in the Basin\u2019s south-eastern catchments. This spatial change in land use \nEconomic return from agricultural production & forestry  \n \nwill cause increased interception in runoff with substantial impact in water availability and \nquality for downstream catchments in the Basin.  \n \nIn a situation where the carbon price will pose a high incentive to change land use patterns \nin  favour  of  forestry,  a  cautious  management  of  the  cap  is  recommended  as  water \navailability may be even further limited if reductions in runoff are not reflected appropriately \nin the Basin\u2019s water use restrictions. Comprehensive spatial planning on a local and regional \nscale is required in such a case in order to evaluate the possible impacts on water and land \nuse availability. Furthermore, more comprehensive research is necessary to describe how a \ndecreased  runoff  due  to  enlarged  forested  lands  can  be  effectively  accounted  for  under \nwater  entitlement  regimes.  Therefore,  we  conclude  that  the  reforestation  polices  as \nsuggested  under  the  Scheme  need  to  be  accompanied  by  a  comprehensive  local  and \nregional spatial planning process to ensure a social and environmental justifiable outcome.  \n \nOther aspects that demand consideration are the risk to investment in harvest forests (such \nare fire, pest and disease outbreak) and the obligations against forest entities which could \ndiminish  future  land  value.  Moreover,  the  robustness  and  reliability  of  accreditation  and \nmonitoring system established need to be thoroughly tested before the commencement of \nthe  Scheme  in  order  to  avoid  leakage  and,  thus,  undermining  the  Scheme.  Further \nresearch would also be required in assessing potential costs associated with managing \nand  maintaining  a  sequestration  permit  registry  as  they  will  provide  information  to  the \nemission market and land users considering reforestation. However, potential transaction \ncosts related with the forest entity\u2019s participation in the Scheme, such as reporting and \nmanagement expenses are currently hardly analysed. If too high, these costs will pose \ndisincentives for participation.  \n \n  \n \nBibliography \nAdamson,  D.

This is the tenth article in a series on climate change and environmentalpolicy being hosted by British Politics and Policy at LSE.In a Guardian comment piece, Vicky Pope, a senior Met Office scientist, articulated a view that isfrequently expressed by scientists: that climate change is a matter of empirical evidence, notbelief. But a decade of social science research on public attitudes shows that in fact, scepticismabout climate change is not primarily due to a misunderstanding of \u201cthe science\u201d.It is true that most people have only a limited amount of knowledge about climate science (as theydo about most specialist subjects). And without doubt, free market and fossil-fuel industry lobbyistshave shamelessly acted as \u201cmerchants of doubt\u201d , exaggerating the level of uncertainty aboutclimate change, or downplaying its importance.But in studies that have asked who is sceptical about climate change and why, we find not a storyabout scientific ignorance, but a link between social attitudes, cultural beliefs and climate changescepticism. The evidence is starkest in the US , but similar patterns are found elsewhere too: older,white, conservative men tend to be more sceptical about climate change.In a paper just published in the journal Climatic Change, my colleagues and I at Cardiff Universityasked what would happen when two groups of people \u2013 one group sceptical about climate change,the other group not \u2013 read the very same information about climate change in the form ofnewspaper editorials constructed especially for the experiment. We found that these two groups ofpeople evaluated the same information in a very different way, attributing opposing judgments ofpersuasiveness and reliability to the editorials.In social psychology, this phenomenon \u2013 \u201cbiased assimilation\u201d \u2013 is well known, and no one isimmune from it, so both sceptics and non-sceptics rated the editorials in line with their existingbeliefs. The critical difference, of course, is that those who were not climate sceptics had the weightof empirical evidence on their side.What this experiment illustrates, though, is that \u201cbelief\u201d in climate change is very much what matters.Without belief in climate change, scientific evidence simply bounces off. And it is social views andcultural beliefs that predict climate change denial, not people\u2019s level of knowledge about climatescience.In fact, recent work by Dan Kahan and his colleagues has found that the more scientifically literatepeople are, the more their ideological filters kick in when reading information about climate change.It might seem counterintuitive, but the more confidence people have in their ability to grasp thescience, the more able they are to slot it into their existing worldview.So does that mean that climate change communicators should give up? Absolutely not \u2013 but weshould not be looking to science to provide us with the answer to a problem that is social in nature.The challenge is to find a way of explaining why climate change matters using language and ideasthat don\u2019t alienate people. Simply repeating the scientific case for climate change is \u2013 unfortunately\u2013 not going to cut it.In fact, the more we know, the less it seems that climate change scepticism has to do with climatescience at all. Climate change provokes such visceral arguments because it allows ancient battles\u2013 about personal responsibility, state intervention, the regulation of industry, the distribution ofresources and wealth, or the role of technologies in society \u2013 to be fought all over again.It follows that the answer to overcoming climate change scepticism is to stop reiterating the science,and start engaging with what climate change scepticism is really about \u2013 competing visions of howpeople see the world, and what they want the future to be like.Do you \u201cbelieve\u201d in climate change might not be the scientifically rational question to ask, but it isthe most essential one to address if we are to understand \u2013 and ultimately get beyond \u2013 climatechange scepticism.This article was originally published by The Guardian on 30 March 2012Please read our comments policy before posting.Note:  This article gives the views of the author, and not the position of the British Politics andPolicy blog, nor of the London School of Economics.

They \nare two global issues that are inextricably linked to each other. According to the International \nOrganization for Migration, \u201cestimates have suggested that between 25 million to one billion \npeople could be displaced by climate change over the next 40 years\u201d (IOM 9).  Not only do they \ncontribute to one another, but they also demonstrate the way that global issues are intersectional \nin nature and must be dealt with as such. After examining the way that climate change policy is \napproached, it is clear that it is reflective of the unequal distribution of burdens and benefits in \nthe modern world. The global north not only contributes to the problem, but controls the way it\u2019s \ndealt with in ways that only serve to reinforce these unequal power structures.  \nClimate change is a problem that will impact the entire world, and very much influence \nthe migration of people. The gradual warming of our climate will result in many adverse effects, \nincluding the melting of the polar ice caps which will result in a rise in sea levels, a change in the \nmakeup of biological landscapes, and an increase in extreme weather events like hurricanes, \ndroughts, and floods (IOM). Extreme weather can cause immediate migratory responses. \nAccording to the IOM, \u201cthe number of natural disasters has more than doubled over the last two \ndecades, and more than 20 million people were displaced by sudden-onset climate-related natural \n \nMcCallum 2 \ndisasters in 2008\u201d (9). When these types of disasters occur, it is often imperative that people \nevacuate, creating a situation in which migration is forced. Climate change is set to change the \nlandscape of the earth as we know it. This has far reaching implications for all humans, as we are \nconnected to the land we occupy. For some humans, land means more than just a place to \noccupy. Many people derive their entire livelihoods from the land in which they live. The global \naverage temperature is predicted to rise between 2 and 5 degrees centigrade (IOM), which has \nthe power to actively reshape the geographical features of the world. For those who rely on the \nland for their food, income, and sustenance, a changing landscape could force them into \nmigration to seek a way to adapt their lives (Dun and Gemenne 10).  \n Both migration and climate change must be examined through an intersectional lens \nbecause they impact the world\u2019s most vulnerable populations. The concept of intersectionality is \nessential to the study of feminism. The term refers to the way that multiple oppressions can \ninterlock and impact a person or group in multiple ways at once. The concept, as emphasized by \nKaijser and Kronsell,  \u201cserves to shed light on how structures of power emerge and interact\u201d \n(418). Examining intersectional oppressions is helpful to understanding the extent to which \ncertain groups are marginalized. An intersectional approach considers the many different \noppressions that exist in the world and instead of distinguishing between them, analyzes how \nthey may all be working in a combined way to oppress people and populations. In order to \nanalyze the world in terms of human rights, an intersectional approach that considers race and \nclass is necessary. Within feminist studies, gender is always an aspect that is examined. \nConsiderations of race, class, and gender are of the utmost importance for intersectional studies.  \n When examining both climate change and migration, some of the most important \nconsiderations include gender, class, and race. Issues impact different populations differently, \n \nMcCallum 3 \nand often it is the most vulnerable who are left to deal with the consequences. Climate change in \nparticular, because it is a worldwide issue, reflects the class and gender inequalities present in the \nglobal order. Climate change is an issue that impacts those who are least equipped to adapt to it. \nThose are the people that depend the most on the land as it is now. An intersectional examination \nleads us to see how, globally, women in poor areas are often the most vulnerable, as \u201cit is widely \naccepted that women in developing countries constitute one of the poorest and most \ndisadvantaged groups in society\u201d (Denton 11). While hard empirical data that distinguishes \nclimate impacts between the genders and classes is not readily available, there are many \nqualitative examinations of the way climate change disproportionately targets those who are \nmarginalized. Climate change research is dominated by those in positions of power, so it is \nsignificant that the following research distinguished the adverse effects of climate change on \nmarginalized groups. Lisa Bendlin, in her intersectional examination of climate change impacts, \nidentifies a variety of ways that climate change impacts women disproportionately in comparison \nto men. Rural poor women who exist at the intersection of gender and class marginalization face \nmany challenges because of climate change. Both extreme weather and changing conditions can \nmake it more dangerous for women to do the work that are traditionally responsible for. For \nexample, women who traditionally play the role of provision-gathering may need to walk longer \ndistances, putting them in harm's way (Bendlin 686). Water-gathering women specifically face \nthe increasing risk of malaria. Women that are traditionally responsible for cooking meals may \nface difficulties with food shortages and the changing availability of traditional foods, thus \ncontributing to hunger issues (Denton 14).  Specific health concerns that only apply to women \ncan become more severe with climate change. Floods, droughts, and hurricanes limit access to \nmedical care, which can be detrimental to pregnant women (Bendlin 686). All of these examples \n \nMcCallum 4 \nshow the ways that climate change would impact women specifically. All of these impacts are \nrooted in the inherently unequal distribution of power between genders, and emphasized by the \nadditional oppression of class. In her analysis, Fatma Denton came to the conclusion that  \n\u201cUnequal power relations between women and men lead to their differential access to \nenvironmental resources and opportunities for income diversification, entailing that \nenvironmental vulnerability, and indeed security, affect women and men differently\u201d (16). She \ngoes further to make the connection between migration and gender by stating, \u201cThe increasing \nmovement of male migrants to 'greener pastures' has tended to compound the poverty that many \nrural women have to contend with\u201d (16). Not only do the unfair power structures shape the way \nthe issue impacts people, but also the way people have to adapt. The power structures are at play \nat each level.  \nEven when not examined in a global context, climate change impacts still have \nintersectional effects. Speaking entirely in regards to the United States\u2019 response to Hurricane \nKatrina, Joan Nagel notes that, \u201cPoverty combines with race and ideologies about gender to \nproduce a metric of deep disadvantage in terms of mobility\u201d (469). In the case of Katrina, an \nextreme weather event, the burdens were distributed unevenly along racial and class lines. The \nmost disadvantaged groups in the area hit hardest were also those who suffered the greatest \nconsequences.  \nIt is important to, in such a global context, distinguish between the \u201cglobal south\u201d and the \n\u201cglobal north\u201d. The distinction refers to the wealth and development differences between the \n\u201cmore developed\u201d nations of the global north, and the \u201cless developed\u201d nations of the global \nsouth. This is an important distinction to make because climate change is an issue that was \n \nMcCallum 5 \nlargely created by the global north, but negatively impacts the global south. As Joan Nagel \nexplains, this is incredibly unfair because,  \nRich countries will have more resources to adapt to the impacts of climate change by \ndesigning barriers to storm surges, refitting buildings and coastal facilities, or rebuilding \naway from coastlines. Poor countries, especially island nations whose land and fresh \nwater supplies are vulnerable to sea level rise, will have to rely on others in the global \nsystem to provide them with resources to adapt or migrate. (470) \n \nThis is significant because those in the global north often fail to account for the consequences of \ntheir actions. As Nagel emphasizes, those in poorer countries will have to \u201cadapt or migrate,\u201d \nwhich often moves the issue outside the realm of just poor countries, and starts to impact the \nworld as a whole. Without a comprehensive analysis of the intersectional nature of the issue, the \nglobal north can go on contributing to problems and not understanding the full extent of the \npotential consequences. It is essential to note that the issues impact regions and groups \ndifferently, and therefore solutions must take this into consideration.  \n The significance of intersectionality is reflected in the policy solutions to both of these \nissues. Policy analysis is an important tool for examining solutions to problems. However, policy \ncan be very tricky as it often times contributes to existing power structures and reinforces \nnegative constructions of already marginalized groups. As Schneider and Ingram note, \u201cthere are \nstrong pressures for public officials to provide beneficial policy to powerful, positively \nconstructed target populations and to devise punitive, punishment-oriented policy for negatively \nconstructed groups\u201d (334). For this reason, policy is often reflective of the needs of those in \npowerful positions. Climate change policy is no different, almost directly mirroring the \ninterlocking oppressions that make climate change worse for those in marginalized positions. \nClimate change policymaking is dominated by men, \u201cwhen it comes to international climate \npolicy content, gender aspects are marginalised. The United Nations Framework Convention on \n \nMcCallum 6 \nClimate Change (UNFCCC), adopted in 1992, completely lacks a gender perspective\u201d (Kaijser & \nKronsell 427). Climate change policy, like migration policy, often fails to consider the needs of \nthose at the bottom. When groups are left out of policy, it immediately becomes more difficult \nfor those groups to find solutions. Climate change policy is dominated by nations of the global \nnorth, who hold more international policymaking capacities because of their wealth and \ninfluence. The intersection of class and policymaking also have \u201cgendered implications,\u201d as \nexplained by Fatma Denton, \u201cIf poorer nations are finding it difficult to get richer nations to \nmeet their obligations and work towards climate mitigation, poor women have an even bigger \nproblem in promoting their agenda\u201d (Denton 16). The class dominated sphere of global \npolicymaking in inextricably linked to gender, demonstrating further how intersectional this \nissue is.  \nIn conclusion, climate change is an issue with vast intersectional implications. Climate \nchange directly influences migration. The two global issues have different impacts on different \ngroups, based on their social construction and the power structures at play in the world. Those \nwho are marginalized in society face the greatest consequences of both climate change and \nmigration.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMcCallum 7 \n \n \n \nBibliography \nBendlin, Lena. \u201cWomen\u2019s human rights in a changing climate: highlighting the distributive \n effects of climate change policies.\u201d Cambridge Review of International Affairs, vol. 27, \n no. 4, pp. 680-698. 2014. \nDenton, Fatma. \u201cClimate change vulnerability, impacts, and adaptation: Why does gender \n matter?\u201d Gender & Development, vol. 10, no. 2, pp. 10-20. 2010.  \n   \nJerneck, Anne. \u201cTaking gender seriously in climate change adaptation and sustainability science \n research: views from feminist debates and sub-Saharan small-scale agriculture.\u201d \n Sustainability Science, pp. 1-14. 2017.  \nKaijser, Anna and Annica Kronsell. \u201cClimate change through the lens of intersectionality.\u201d \n Environmental Politics, vol. 23, no. 3, pp. 417-433. 2013.  \nNagel, Joane. \u201cIntersecting identities and global climate change.\u201d Identities, vol. 19, no. 4, pp. \n 467-476. 2012.  \nDun, Olivia and Fran\u00e7ois Gemenne. \"Defining 'Environmental Migration'.\" Forced Migration \n Review, vol. 1, no. 31, Oct. 2008, pp. 10-11. \nIOM, ed.
