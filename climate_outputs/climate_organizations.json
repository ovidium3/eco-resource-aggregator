The\nImplementation Climate Scale (ICS) has been developed to allow researchers and organizations to assess climate for\nEBP implementation in health and allied health service organizations. The ICS consists of 18 items and measures six\ndimensions of implementation climate: focus on EBP, educational support for EBP, recognition for EBP, rewards for\nEBP, selection for EBP, and selection for openness. The ICS was initially developed in a mental health context; thus,\nthe goal of this study was to provide initial validation of the ICS in substance use disorder (SUD) treatment settings.\nMethods: Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to assess the psychometric functioning of the ICS using\nsurvey data from 326 providers in 65 teams in SUD treatment programs. Cronbach\u2019s alpha was examined to assess\ninternal consistency of the ICS, and individual and team level construct-based validity was examined by comparing\nits correlations with service climate, molar climate, and organizational change.\nResults: We found evidence for the reliability, factor structure, and validity of the ICS in SUD services.

Although EBPs are known to re-\nsearchers as efficacious practices supported by research\nevidence, there is still a discrepancy between the know-\nledge that EBPs are available and the usage of EBPs by\nproviders (i.e., clinicians) with their clients [1\u20133]. This\ndiscrepancy is apparent in SUD services, and can be\u00a9 The Author(s). 2019 Open Access This artic\nInternational License (http://creativecommons\nreproduction in any medium, provided you g\nthe Creative Commons license, and indicate if\n(http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/ze\n* Correspondence: gaarons@ucsd.edu\n4Department of Psychiatry, University of California, La Jolla, San Diego, CA,\nUSA\n5Child and Adolescent Services Research Center, San Diego, CA, USA\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the articlepartly attributed to the addiction field\u2019s historical roots\nof development outside of mainstream health care [4\u20136].\nOverall, implementation of EBPs for SUD has received\nless attention than for mental health [7\u201313]. The unique\ndevelopment of SUD treatment systems, which evolved\nseparately from mainstream health care and from mental\nhealth treatment systems has contributed to this science\nto practice gap in SUD services [10, 14]. Through the\nmid-1900s, individuals with SUD were socially stigma-\ntized and were refused treatment from most practi-\ntioners and hospitals [10]. This resulted in an emergence\nof alternative treatment offered primarily through \u201ccom-\npassionate peers who were themselves in recovery\u201d\n([10], p. 26).

Substance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy           (2019) 14:35 Page 2 of 10subsequently for other drug use disorders, though SUD\ntreatment remained segregated from medical and mental\nhealth services. A lack of centralized, federal, policies\ngoverning the SUD system resulted in each state design-\ning individual public SUD health care systems with vary-\ning organizational and financing structures [15].\nDifferences emerged between SUD and mental health\nwith regard to insurance coverage, such that clients may\nhave coverage that provides mental health services but\nexcluded SUD treatment [16, 17]. SUD treatment pro-\nviders, programs, and systems grew more strongly loyal\nto particular treatment models, often with limited scien-\ntific evidence for efficacy [18, 19]. Specifically, SUD\ntreatment practices continued to be influenced by the\nexperiences of people in recovery, primarily through Al-\ncoholics Anonymous and related 12-step programs [10].\nAt present, the literature reflects a general openness of\nSUD professionals to learning new practices [10].\nAdditionally, federal and state initiatives have made ef-\nforts to advance SUD EBP implementation [20]. For ex-\nample, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)\nBlue Ribbon Task Force encouraged an increase in\nfunded studies examining substance use EBPs and their\ndissemination, implementation, and sustainment in real-\nworld settings [21]. Within SUD health care systems, in-\nstability and closure of treatment programs is common\nand further warrants investigation of EBP implementa-\ntion in such systems [22].\nWithin implementation research, there has been an in-\ncreasing interest in the organizational context within\ntreatment agencies and how the environment within\nwhich providers work impacts the successful uptake and\nimplementation of EBPs [23]. As a guide for the factors\nthat may affect implementation in public service sectors,\nAarons and colleagues [24] developed the Exploration,\nPreparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) multi-\nlevel implementation framework, which characterizes\nfour phases of the implementation process and catego-\nrizes implementation factors into outer (system) and\ninner (organizational) context. Within SUD treatment\nsettings, researchers have identified several outer system\nfactors which impact successful EBP implementation, in-\ncluding interagency collaborations [25] and network\nconnectedness with non-criminal justice agencies [26].\nMoreover, several inner organizational factors have also\nbeen identified as playing a pivotal role in whether EBPs\nare successfully implemented, such as leadership [26],\ncounselor attitudes toward EBP [27, 28], and perceptions\nof organizational readiness for change [29\u201331].\nThe focus of the present study is on one particular in-\ndicator of the inner organizational context for EBP im-\nplementation: organizational climate. In recent years,\nthere has been an increasing interest in examining the\ninfluence of organizational climate on the EBPimplementation process (e.g., [32\u201334]). Organizational\nclimate has been defined as \u201cthe shared meaning\norganizational members attach to the events, policies,\npractices, and procedures they experience and the be-\nhaviors they see being rewarded, supported, and ex-\npected\u201d ([35], p. 69). Research on organizational climate\nhas been categorized by two primary approaches: those\naddressing molar climate and those addressing a more\nspecific or focused climate [35]. Generic or molar cli-\nmates capture the overall organizational environment\nand employees\u2019 experiences in an organization as a\nwhole. In contrast, focused climates capture factors that\nare relevant to attaining specific strategic outcomes, such\nas customer service [36] and safety [37].\nOf the SUD treatment research targeting the role of\nthe organizational context in EBP implementation, gen-\neric or molar organizational climate has typically been\nthe focus, measured as part of the Organizational Readi-\nness for Change (ORC) assessment [31]. The ORC is\nposited as a comprehensive appraisal of organizational\nfunctioning which includes four domains: 1) motivation\nfor change, 2) resources, 3) staff attributes, and 4)\norganizational climate [38]. Within the organizational\nclimate domain of the ORC are six scales: clarity of mis-\nsion and goals, staff cohesiveness, staff autonomy, open-\nness of communication, stress, and openness to change.\nIn line with molar climate measures, these scales capture\ngeneral organizational functioning and are not specific\nto a specific strategic imperative (such as implementa-\ntion). A recent review found the ORC was used in mul-\ntiple studies examining the influence of organizational\nreadiness for change on EBP implementation in SUD\ntreatment programs; however, the application of ORC\nfindings in the process of implementing quality improve-\nment initiatives remains unclear [39].\nAlthough much of the current research examining the\nimpact of organizational climate on the implementation\nof EBPs has focused on molar climate [23, 29, 40, 41],\nresearchers are now investigating the role of specific, fo-\ncused climates, including the organization\u2019s climate for\nEBP implementation [33, 42\u201344]. Strategic climates de-\nvelop depending on how employees gauge management\u2019s\ninterpretation of the climate, and observing the degree\nto which leaders expect, support, and reward the use of\ncertain targeted clinical and service strategies such as\nEBPs. Strategic EBP implementation climate develops\nwhen the organization and its leaders communicate and\ndemonstrate their values regarding the importance of\nimplementing EBPs. In organizations where EBP imple-\nmentation climate is high, employees perceive that the\norganization supports the implementation of EBPs. In\nturn, employees also focus their attention on EBP imple-\nmentation, and model these perceived organizational\nvalues. The presence of a strong EBP implementation\nEhrhart et al. Substance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy           (2019) 14:35 Page 3 of 10climate should ultimately result in enhanced EBP spe-\ncific outcomes [33, 42, 43, 45].\nBuilding on foundational research on implementation\nclimate by Klein, Conn, and Sorra [46] and Schein\u2019s\nwork on climate/culture embedding mechanisms [47],\nEhrhart, Aarons, and Farahnak [43] defined an EBP im-\nplementation climate as \u201cemployees\u2019 shared perceptions\nof the importance of EBP implementation within the\norganization\u201d (p. 2). To measure the EBP implementa-\ntion climate, they drew from past literature on imple-\nmentation climate and other focused climates as well as\nsubject matter expert input to develop the Implementa-\ntion Climate Scale (ICS). The ICS identifies the following\nsix factors that contribute to successful implementation\nclimate: 1) the team/agency focus on EBP, 2) providing\neducation support for EBP, 3) recognizing staff for utiliz-\ning EBP, 4) providing rewards to staff for employing\nEBP, 5) selecting staff who have prior EBP experience,\nand 6) selecting staff for general openness. Research on\nthe ICS has shown that it is positively related with a var-\niety of implementation-related outcomes [48\u201350]. Al-\nthough this measure has been validated in mental health\n[43] and child welfare [51] settings, it has not been vali-\ndated in SUD settings.\nThe purpose of this study was to examine the psycho-\nmetric characteristics of the ICS in a sample of SUD ser-\nvice organizations. Although there are limited studies to\ndate on implementation of EBPs in SUD as compared to\nmental health services, research on mental health EBP\nimplementation can serve a useful guide [20]. As such,\nwe hypothesized that the psychometric properties and\nfactor structure of the ICS in SUD settings would be\nsimilar to what has been found in past research in exam-\nining the ICS in mental health services. Aligned with\nprevious validation studies of the ICS [43], we evaluated\nconstruct-based validity with similar and relevant con-\nstructs to EBP implementation climate. We hypothesized\nthat the ICS would have moderate positive correlations\nwith another focused climate, service climate, which\nevaluates the organization\u2019s emphasis on providing high\nquality services. Organizations that emphasize high qual-\nity service are likely also to place an emphasis on EBP\nimplementation, but the distinct focus of each type of\nclimate should mean that the measures are not com-\npletely overlapping. We hypothesized a weak positive\ncorrelation between the ICS and general molar climate,\nwhich is related to aspects of generally effective work\nunits. Teams that are generally well-functioning may\nalso be more likely to place an emphasis on EBP imple-\nmentation, but the measures should be distinct because\nthe content of molar climate is not implementation spe-\ncific. We hypothesized a weak positive correlation be-\ntween the ICS and planned organizational change,\nbecause even though organizations that place a strongemphasis on EBP implementation are likely to be under-\ngoing change, the measure includes aspects of\ninnovation and flexibility that are not central to EBP im-\nplementation. A weak negative correlation with uncer-\ntainty of organizational change was also hypothesized.\nBecause teams with a strong implementation climate\nwould have a structure and processes for successful im-\nplementation, we expect less uncertainty about change\nin such environments.\nMethod\nSample\nOur sample consisted of 326 SUD service providers\nemployed in three publicly funded, non-profit SUD or-\nganizations in California and New York. Of the 363 eli-\ngible providers, 327 (90.1%) participated in the survey.\nOf the 327 participants, one participant was not in-\ncluded in the analytic sample due to missing data for the\nentire ICS measure, resulting in a final analytic sample\nof 326. Of the 326 participants, 166 (50.9%) were from\none organization (all in CA), another 107 (32.8%) from a\nsecond organization (54 in CA and 53 in NY), and 53\n(16.3%) from a third organization (all in CA). Providers\nwere organized into 65 teams (i.e., providers who report\nto the same supervisor), with an average team size of\n5.02 (SD = 3.1; range = 1\u201313). Consistent with other re-\nsearch in SUD service settings [52], the sample was pre-\ndominately female (62.9%) with an average age of 46.49\nyears (SD = 11.61, range 21\u201371). The racial distribution\nof the sample was 59.7% \u2018Caucasian\u2019, 18.9% \u2018African-\nAmerican\u2019, 1.3% \u2018Native-American\u2019, 2.8% \u2018Asian-Ameri-\ncan or Pacific Islander\u2019, and 17.3% \u2018Other\u2019, with 28.5% of\nparticipants identifying as \u2018Hispanic/Latino.\u2019 The major-\nity of participants completed at least some college edu-\ncation (90.5%), and 9.5%% indicating they had less than\na college education. Additional demographic characteris-\ntics can be found in Table 1.\nProcedure\nPrior to recruitment, initial contact with agency execu-\ntives was made to gain approval to proceed and to verify\nthat the organization had recent, if not current, experi-\nence implementing an EBP. Upon approval, supervisors\nwere then contacted via email to schedule a call present-\ning the study to their staff. During those calls, the re-\nsearch team provided further information about the\ndefinition of, and ensured staff familiarity with, EBP.\nData were collected via online (n = 222) and paper-\nand-pencil (n = 104) surveys depending on feasibility,\nand the survey took approximately 20\u201330min to\ncomplete. A comparison of the means on the ICS sub-\nscales revealed no significant differences in the ICS\nmeasure based on the method of survey completion (on-\nline versus paper-and-pencil).

For online surveys each participant was\nemailed a unique password and username, in addition to\nthe link to the survey. For in-person data collection the\nresearch team reserved an hour during a regularly occur-\nring team meeting. Participants were ensured that their\nresponses to the survey would be completely confidentialand individually identifiable data would not be provided\nback to their supervisors. If participants were not able to\ncomplete the survey in-person and collecting data online\nwas not practical, surveys were left or mailed to the par-\nticipating agencies and returned to the research team via\nmail.\nMeasures\nImplementation climate\nImplementation climate was measured using the Imple-\nmentation Climate Scale (ICS; 43). Providers reported\nabout their team\u2019s (i.e., their work group\u2019s) implementa-\ntion climate. Specifically, the referent for the respondent\nwas the team, which was determined based on the ser-\nvice provider\u2019s direct supervisor. The ICS is comprised\nof 18 items with and respondents are asked to respond\nregarding the degree to which they agree with each\nstatement using response anchors from 0 (\u2018not at all\u2019) to\n4 (\u2018to a very great extent\u2019). Items fall into six subscales:\n1) Focus on EBP (\u03b1 = .90), 2) Educational support for\nEBP (\u03b1 = .84), 3) Recognition for EBP (\u03b1 = .78), 4) Re-\nwards for EBP (\u03b1 = .81), 5) Selection for EBP (\u03b1 = .89),\nand 6) Selection for openness (\u03b1 = .85). The mean of the\nsubscales was computed to create the ICS score\n(\u03b1 = .90). The complete ICS measure including scoring\ninstructions can be found in the \u201cadditional files\u201d accom-\npanying the original measurement development study\n[43]; https://implementationscience.biomedcentral.com/\narticles/10.1186/s13012-014-0157-1.\nService climate\nService climate refers to employees\u2019 perceptions of prac-\ntices, procedures, and behaviors that are expected,\nrewarded, and supported with regard to customer ser-\nvice and customer service quality. To assess service cli-\nmate, we used eight items adapted from Schneider and\ncolleagues\u2019 service climate measure (\u03b1 = .91) [53]. Items\nwere modified to apply specifically to a SUD service set-\nting. All service climate items were scored on a 0\n(\u201cpoor\u201d) to 4 (\u201cexcellent\u201d) scale.\nOrganizational climate\nMolar organizational climate was measuring using the\nOrganizational Climate Measure (OCM; [54]). The\nOCM in its entirety consists of 17 scales capturing a\nbroad range of molar organizational climate. Consistent\nwith the original measurement development study [43],\nthree of the 17 scales were used to examine construct-\nbased validity. The three scales included in this study\nassessed climate for performance feedback (\u03b1 = .89, five\nitems), involvement (\u03b1 = .88, six items), and efficiency\n(\u03b1 = .89, four items). OCM items were scored on a 0\n(\u201cnot at all\u201d) to 3 (\u201cdefinitely true\u201d) scale.\nTable 2 Summary statistics for the ICS total scale and subscales\nMean SD \u03b1 ICC(1) awg(j)\nImplementation Climate Scale total 2.04 .66 .90 .04 .76\nImplementation Climate Subscales\nFocus on EBP 2.63 .88 .90 .11 .80\nEducational Support for EBP 2.25 1.03 .84 .15 .77\nRecognition for EBP 1.86 .97 .78 .07 .77\nRewards for EBP .64 .88 .81 .04 .62\nSelection for EBP 2.23 .97 .89 \u2212.02 .80\nSelection for Openness 2.63 .92 .85 .05 .78\nEhrhart et al. Substance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy           (2019) 14:35 Page 5 of 10Organizational change\nThe Perceived Organizational Change (POC) measure\n[55] was utilized to assess organizational change. The\nsubscales planned change (\u03b1 = .80, three items) and psy-\nchological uncertainty (\u03b1 = .91, four items) were used to\nexamine construct-validity. POC items were scores on a\n0 (\u201cstrongly disagree\u201d) to 4 (\u201cstrongly agree\u201d) scale.\nStatistical analyses\nTo evaluate the psychometric properties of the ICS, con-\nfirmatory factor analyses (CFA) were conducted using\nMplus statistical software [56]. A confirmatory factor\nanalysis allows researchers to test whether the proposed\nstructure of the data (i.e., the loading of items on par-\nticular subscales or factors) aligns with the actual data\ncollected [57]. We accounted for the nested data struc-\nture using the \u2018CLUSTER\u2019 command, and used max-\nimum likelihood estimation with robust standard errors\nto adjust the standard error and chi-square values for\nnon-normality. Although minimal, missing data were\naccounted for using full information maximum likeli-\nhood (FIML) estimation. In order to assess model fit,\nseveral descriptive fix indexes and recommended cutoffs\nwere utilized, with comparative fit index (CFI) greater\nthan .95, the root mean square error of approximation\n(RMSEA) less than .06, and the standardized root mean\nsquare residual (SRMR) less than .08 indicating strong\nmodel fit [58].\nCronbach\u2019s alpha was also assessed for each of the\nsubscales and overall ICS to evaluate internal\nconsistency reliability. Intraclass correlations (ICC[1]s)\nand the average correlation within team (awg(j)) for each\nsubscale were calculated to evaluate the aggregation of\nthe individual-level responses to the unit (i.e., team)\nlevel. Higher values on both ICC(1) and awg(j) suggest\nthat aggregation to the unit level is appropriate. ICC(1)\nvalues ranging from .05\u2013.20 are typically seen in applied\nresearch [59]. Three of the 65 teams were not included\nin the aggregation analyses as they were comprised of\nonly one provider. Lastly, individual and team level\nconstruct-based validity of the ICS was examined by\ncomparing the correlations with service climate, molar\nclimate, and organizational change.\nResults\nTable 2 provides the ICS scale reliabilities, item means,\nstandard deviations, and the aggregation statistics. The\nICS range of means for subscales was 1.86 to 2.63 on the\n0\u20134 response scale, with the exception of Rewards for\nEBP, which was notably lower at .64. This pattern was\nsimilar to that reported by Ehrhart, Aarons, and Farah-\nnak [43] with the biggest difference being for the Focus\non EBP dimension, which had a mean of 2.63 in this\nsample versus 2.28 in a mental health sample.Cronbach\u2019s alpha reliabilities for the subscales and ICS\ntotal score ranged from .78\u2013.90, demonstrating strong\ninternal consistency reliability and in line with the find-\nings of Ehrhart, Aarons, and Farahnak [43]. The awg(j)\nvalues for the total ICS scale were strong, ranging from\n.76 to .80, except for the Rewards subscale which was\nnotable lower at .62. In order to determine the amount\nof dependency among observations within teams, intra-\nclass correlations, specifically ICC(1) values, were calcu-\nlated. The ICC(1) for the overall ICS scale was .04. The\nICC(1) values for the subscales ranged from \u2212.02 to .15;\nall values were .03 or larger except for the value for the\nSelection for EBP subscale. Overall, the awg(j) values were\nsimilarly strong as in the Ehrhart, Aarons, and Farahnak\n[43] paper, but the ICC(1) values were not as strong. Al-\nthough this pattern of aggregation statistics supports the\nuse of the ICS subscales and total scale as unit-level con-\nstructs in SUD treatment settings, it does suggest that\nthere may be less within team variability in the imple-\nmentation climate levels of SUD treatment settings rela-\ntive to mental health settings.\nCFA results provided support for the six-factor imple-\nmentation climate model (\u03c72(120) = 324.21, p < 0.001;\nCFI = 0.92, RMSEA = 0.075, 90% CI [.066, .085], Prob-\nability RMSEA <= .000; SRMR = 0.074). Additional sup-\nport for the factor structure was found as the\nstandardized factor loadings ranged from .57 to .90 and\nwere all statistically significant (p\u2019s < 0.001), as shown in\nTable 3.\nTable 4 shows the correlations among the ICS sub-\nscales. In general, the correlations between the Rewards\nsubscale and the other five dimensions (average r = .25)\nwere lower than the correlations among the other five\ndimensions (average r = .45). Of particular note, the two\nlowest correlations were between Rewards and Selection\nfor Openness (r = .16, p < .01) and Focus on EBP (r = .15,\np < .01).\nCorrelations for the ICS total score and its six\nsubscales with all of the proposed validity measures\nat the individual and team-levels can be found in\nTables 5 and 6, respectively.

At the team level, correlations were slightly\nlower and the correlation with efficiency was not sig-\nnificant (performance feedback: r = 0.33, p < 0.01; in-\nvolvement: r = 0.31, p < 0.01; efficiency: r = 0.23, p >\n0.05). EBP implementation climate was positively re-\nlated to perceptions of planned change (r = 0.30, p <\n0.01) and negatively related to perceptions of uncer-\ntainty (r = \u2212 0.24, p < 0.01) at the individual level,\nwith a similar pattern at the team level (planned\nchange: r = 0.38, p < 0.01; uncertainty: r = \u2212 0.38, p <\n0.01). Taken together, these correlations provide evi-\ndence of the construct validity of the ICS.\nDiscussion\nThe goal of this study was to assess the psychometric\ncharacteristics and provide validation evidence for use of\nthe ICS in SUD treatment settings. The ICS showed\nstrong internal consistency reliability and acceptable fit\nfor the overall factor structure. In addition, the pattern\nof correlations with other measures supported the con-\nstruct validity of the ICS and were consistent our hy-\npotheses. Taken together, these findings suggest that\nSUD organizations who make EBP implementation a\npriority also emphasize giving high quality service to cli-\nents, providing performance feedback to providers, in-\nvolving employees in decision making, making sure\nwork is done efficiently, and planning for organizational\nchange while also reducing uncertainty around change.\nOverall, the results supported the use of the ICS in\nSUD organizations. To date, the majority of research on\nEBP implementation in SUD has targeted molar\norganizational climate particularly through the develop-\nment and use of the ORC. Although the ORC is helpful\nin assessing general organizational functioning [38], its\napplication in EBP implementation remains unclear [39].\nHaving a brief, reliable, and valid tool to assess the ex-\ntent to which the organization\u2019s climate is supportive of\nEBP implementation provides more focus than the con-\nstructs assessed by the ORC. Thus, the use of the ICS al-\nlows organizations to understand the extent to which\ntheir orgnaizational environment aligns with implemen-\ntation efforts, and to identify specific areas related to im-\nplementation to possibly target for leadership and\norganizaitonal interventions. Additionally, the availability\nof this measure provides researchers with a brief and\npragmatic measure [60] with which to understand the\nfactors that are related to the development of an EBP\nimplementation climate and the organizational and im-\nplementation outcomes that result when EBP implemen-\ntaiton climate levels are high [50].\nTable 5 Individual-level construct-based validity correlations of Implementation Climate Scale scores\nFocus on\nEBP\nEducational\nSupport\nRecognition for\nEBP\nRewards for\nEBP\nSelection for\nEBP\nSelection for\nOpenness\nICS\nTotal\nService Climate .42** .43** .33** .24** .45** .50** .57**\nOrganizational Climate\nPerformance\nFeedback\n.31** .39** .20** .07 .27** .37** .39**\nInvolvement .30** .31** .17** .03 .34** .48** .39**\nEfficiency .22** .24** .10 .04 .25** .30** .28**\nPerceived Organizational Change\nPlanned Change .24** .26** .25** .07 .21** .23** .30**\nUncertainty \u2212.23** \u2212.14* \u2212.09 \u2212.01 \u2212.23** \u2212.30** \u2212.24**\nNote: N = 326; *p < .05, **p < .01\nEhrhart et al. Substance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy           (2019) 14:35 Page 7 of 10The availability of a brief, and valid, tool that organiza-\ntions and researchers can access to assess EBP imple-\nmentation climate is particularly relevant for SUD\ntreatment systems which have historically maintained a\nparticularly wide science and practice gap. Very few\nstudies on the dissemination and implementation of\nEBPs in SUD treatment have utilized valid measures of\nimplementation, let alone measures of implementation\nclimate [7]. Contributions by Damschroder and Hage-\ndorn have recommended increased consideration of\nouter and inner context factors influencing EBP imple-\nmentation in SUD treatment systems. Such factors\ninclude policies and incentives/rewards for implementa-\ntion, engagement of implementation leaders/champions,\nand organizational culture for implementation [61].\nOngoing formative evaluation is critical for any imple-\nmentation effort [62]. The application of a tool such as\nthe ICS to measure EBP implementation climate in SUD\ntreatment systems can help to guide successful EBP im-\nplementation efforts, serving to narrow this science and\npractice gap [5, 7, 31, 63].\nAlthough the general pattern of results was supportive\nof the measure as a whole, it is notable that the findings\nfor the Rewards dimension were not as strong as for theTable 6 Team-level construct-based validity correlations of Impleme\nFocus on\nEBP\nEducational\nSupport\nRecognition fo\nEBP\nService Climate .48** .45** .45**\nOrganizational Climate\nPerformance\nFeedback\n.47** .55** .32*\nInvolvement .31** .27* .18\nEfficiency .12 .21 .11\nPerceived Organizational Change\nPlanned Change .39** .27* .36**\nUncertainty \u2212.25* \u2212.28* \u2212.31*\nNote: N = 62; Only those teams with two or more members were included in team-other dimensions. For instance, the within-unit agree-\nment was lowest for the Rewards subscale, and the cor-\nrelations between the Rewards subscale and the other\ndimensions were lower than the correlations among the\nother five dimensions. Furthermore, as shown in Tables 5\nand 6, the Rewards subscale had the weakest correlations\nwith the measures included to provide construct validity\nevidence, including at both the individual and team\nlevels of analysis. These results are in line with what was\nfound when this scale was validated in child welfare set-\ntings [51], such that the scale performed less well in\nthese settings than in the mental health setting where\nthe measure was originally developed [43]. There are\nseveral plausible explanations for the poorer perform-\nance of the Rewards dimension in this SUD services\nsample compared to mental health setting. One possibil-\nity is the generally limited availability of funds for any\nsort of financial reward, particularly in often undere-\nsourced SUD treatment agencies. With such a low base\nrate for rewards, the scale properties are affected for all\nsubsequent analyses. In contrast, the Recognition sub-\nscale, which addresses non-financial recognition of pro-\nviders for implementation efforts, performed better\nacross most analyses.

Substance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy           (2019) 14:35 Page 8 of 10dimension performs more poorly in SUD services due to\nthe fact many SUD service providers are in recovery\nthemselves and are strongly motivated to be of service to\nothers. A tenet of many 12-step programs often en-\ndorsed by individuals in recovery is to carry the message\nof the 12-steps forward to others in need. As a result, fi-\nnancial rewards may be interpreted as inappropriate, or\nincongruent, with this recovery-oriented perspective.\nThe question then becomes whether the scale should\nsimply be removed for use in SUD settings. In our own\nwork with organizations, we have found that there are\ncreative ways to use small financial rewards to reinforce\nimplementation efforts in a manner that is consistent\nwith the values of SUD service providers. The inclusion\nof the Rewards scale could encourage management to\nconsider what options may be available to them if imple-\nmenting EBPs with fidelity is indeed a high priority for\nthe organization, if appropriate. Further, as SUD agen-\ncies consider how best to create a positive EBP imple-\nmentation climate, the base rate for the use of rewards\nmay increase. Thus, although the ICS may perform bet-\nter for research purposes without the inclusion of the\nRewards subscale, there are practical reasons to use it\nfor applied purposes.\nSome limitations of the study should be noted. Al-\nthough the Selection for EBP subscale generally per-\nformed well across the various analyses that were\nconducted, its ICC(1) value was negative, which can\noccur when the between group variability is smaller than\nthe variability within groups. Given the relatively high\nlevels of within-group agreement for this scale (based on\nthe awg(j) values), this suggests that although individuals\ngenerally agree about this issue within their teams, the\nteam means tended to be quite similar across the sam-\nple. A larger sample of organizations and teams would\nlikely show more variability in whether experience with\nEBPs is considered in hiring systems. On a related note,\nbecause the sample came from three, relatively large\nSUD agencies, the findings may not be consistent with\nsmaller agencies, particularly in more rural areas. More\nresearch with broader sampling is needed to support\ngeneralizability of the measure in these more rural SUD\ntreatment contexts. Another limitation of the study is\nthat the focus of the measure is EBPs in general, rather\nthan a specific EBP. If SUD organizations are imple-\nmenting multiple EBPs at any given time, the overall cli-\nmate for EBP implementation is likely to be particularly\nrelevant. In contrast, if the entire organization is focused\non a single implementation, the presence of a climate\nfor that specific EBP may emerge. Future research\nshould consider this possibility and compare the\nmeasurement and relationships with other variables\nfor these two different approaches to assessing imple-\nmentation climate.Conclusions\nIn conclusion, the organizational context for implemen-\ntation is a critical factor in setting the foundation for im-\nplementation success. Having a tool that is valid and\nreliable, in addition to being brief and practical for ap-\nplied use, allows SUD organizations to better understand\nhow to build a climate to support implementation and\nallows substance abuse researchers to better understand\nthe role of climate in implementation effectiveness. Fu-\nture research should expand on the study of this meas-\nure with additional constructs as well as establishing\ncriterion-related validity evidence by showing its rela-\ntionship with key implementation outcomes.\nAbbreviations\nCFA: Confirmatory factor analysis; CFI: Comparative fit index; EBP: Evidence-\nbased practice; EPIS: Exploration Preparation Implementation Sustainment;\nFIML: Full information maximum likelihood; ICC: Intraclass correlation\ncoefficient; ICS: Implementation Climate Scale; NIDA: National Institute on\nDrug Abuse; OCM: Organizational Climate Measure; ORC: Organizational\nReadiness for Change; POC: Perceived Organizational Change; RMSEA: Root\nmean square error of approximation; SRMR: Standardized root mean square\nresidual; SUD: Substance use disorder\nAcknowledgements\nPreparation of this paper was supported by the National Institute of Mental\nHealth and National Institute on Drug Abuse grants noted below, and by the\nChild and Adolescent Services Research Center (CASRC) and the Center for\nOrganizational Research on Implementation and Leadership (CORIL).

    "fullText": "1INFO NOTE\nAdaptation is often considered a high priority and a \nprimary consideration for policy makers and planners \nbecause of the current and projected impacts of \nclimate change on agriculture and natural resources. \nCommunities that lack the capacity to respond to \nclimate variability are at great risk. The impacts of \nclimate change on agriculture include the loss of agro-\nbiodiversity, soil degradation, reduction in crop, fi sh, \nand livestock productivity, water shortages, reduction \nof nutritional quality of foods, and possible increases \nin destructive pests and diseases. With a large \npopulation reliant on farming, it is important to fi nd \nways of building resilience to climate change.\nFostering local adaptation platforms for \nagriculture: How context speci\ufb01 c climate-smart \nvillages (CSVs) can relate to local adaptation efforts\nAdapting to climate change requires adjusting \nagricultural practices to meet changing and more \ndifficult environmental conditions. Traditional and \nnewly introduced practices can help farmers cope \nwith current variability and future climate risks. \nClimate-Smart Agriculture (CSA)/Climate Resilient \nAgriculture (CRA) is one way of helping farmers \nprepare for the future.\nClimate change affects different communities in \ndiff erent ways. Adaptation eff orts must therefore be \nlocalized and context-specifi c. Various studies have \nalready shown that smallholder farmers are most \nvulnerable to adverse impacts of climate change. \nInterventions that support them in building their \nresilience are not only necessary but urgent.\nBuilding the resilience of smallholder farming and \nfishing communities requires interventions that \nprovide them greater access to a portfolio of \ntechnologies, information, support services, market \nlinkage, and fi nance/credit. These would enable them \nto adjust, modify, or change their current production \nsystems and practices in an environmentally friendly \nway. This process is community-based adaptation.\n \nClimate smart villages (CSV) are platforms that nurture \nadaptation efforts and build local adaptation \ncapacities.

If we start \nNOW, we can do a lot to reduce the impacts  \nof climate change, build resilience in our \nfood systems, ensure food safety, reduce \nrisks and vulnerabilities of farming \ncommunities, and protect agriculture and \nsmallholder farmers.\nJanuary 2020\nRene Vidallo, Ruvicyn Bayot, Magnolia Rosimo, Emilita Monville-Oro, Julian Gonsalves, Alicia Ilaga, \nLeocadio Sebastian, U-Nichols Manalo, Perla Baltazar\n2 INFO NOTE\nCSVs as platforms for climate-resilient agriculture technologies \nand practices\nCSA/CRA refers to environment friendly and \nsustainable agricultural practices that takes climate \nchange and variability into consideration. Scaling-out \nCSA/CRA involves building adaptive models that \nprovide practical guidance and serve as focal points \nfor communities, organizations, and governments in \nthe local level. CSA/CRA considerations should be \nincluded in local government plans. Projects must \ndemonstrate impact and uptake at scale if local \ngovernments are to take notice. The new interest and \ninvestments are our best opportunity to deliver on our \npromises to end hunger, reduce poverty, and achieve \nthe sustainable development goals.\n \nThe key objectives of CSA/CRA include:\n \u2022 Increase agriculture productivity and income in a \nsustainable, environmentally sound manner;\n \u2022 Build the capacity of households and food systems \nto adapt to climate change;\n \u2022 Ensure food safety and security while protecting \nlives and livelihoods; and\n \u2022 Promote low emission development (reduced \ngreen house gas emission and enhanced carbon \ncapture).\nTo ensure lasting results, it is not enough to limit our \nwork that address climate change impact on \nagriculture. We also need to address poverty and \nreduce climate vulnerabilities through the use of \nmultiple benefit approaches (e.g. diversified farms, \nalternative livelihoods, and micro enterprises).\nresearch is undertaken to learn how to adapt to climate \nchange while reducing green house gas emission from \nagriculture. CSVs promote low emission development \noptions and serve as focal point for developing such \nsolutions.

Vulnerability assessments help to better \nunderstand location and context-specific climate \nchange impacts, which enables stakeholders to \nproperly identify options for addressing it.\nCBA is a process of resilience building that is grounded \non location and context-specific vulnerabilities. The \ngoal of CBA is to build resilience in a bottom up \nmanner. This is why community-based participatory \naction research is essential for deriving effective \nsolutions. Finding solutions that work locally involve a \nprocess of participatory technology development \n(action research and learning). Farming and fishing \ncommunities identify, plan, design, field test, and learn \nabout the effectiveness and scalability of a portfolio \nof options for addressing specific risks and \nvulnerabilities.\nBuilding resilient smallholder farms and communities \nentails understanding the complexities that contribute \nto vulnerabilities and risks; and developing multiple \nscales and levels of strategies that all contribute to \naddressing the multi-dimensional challenges of food, \nnutrition and livelihood insecurities.\n \nCSVs: focal points for adaptive research at local level\nThe objectives of any country\u2019s National Adaptation \nPlan are to reduce the impacts of climate change by \nbuilding adaptive capacities and to facilitate the \nintegration of climate change adaptation in a coherent \nmanner into relevant policies and programmes and \nactivities (UNFCC, 2012). Climate change can lead to a \nloss of assets, result in reduced income flows, and \naffect livelihoods and food security. There is a need \nfor no regrets climate adaptation work (promoting \nclimate resilience in agriculture in order to build \ncapacities to cope with climate impacts even if the \nworst fears do not materialize). There are risks in \npromoting measures that deliver on short term gains, \nbut which compromise the coping capacities of \ncommunities (in the long run). \nThis can be referred to as mal-adaptation. National \nAdaptation Plans reduce vulnerability to climate \nchange, help build capacities, and promote resilience. \nAt local levels, CSVs (or other local adaptation \nplatforms) can help serve as crucible for testing and \ndeveloping solutions relevant to National Adaptation \nPlans. They facilitate climate change adaptation into \nlocal programs and plans. Climate change adaptation \nprocess and approaches are developed in these \ncommunity-based platforms.\nIndividual action is not enough to cope with climate \nchange. CSVs provide venues where different \nstakeholders collectively participate in the program/\nproject planning and implementation. Here, they can \ngenerate practical adaptation and mitigation options \nto improve their food security, nutrition, and climate \nresilience. Concerted actions in the CSVs operate at \nthe community level and its surrounding landscape.\nCSVs are primarily focal points for deriving or/and \ntesting location-specific adaptation options in \nagriculture, livestock, aquaculture, and in allied natural \nresource management sectors (agroforestry, agro-\nbiodiversity, community forestry, etc). Multiple CSV \nsites represent different agroecologies, climate risks, \netc. This diversity in context is useful for comparison, \nextrapolation, climate analogue research, etc. CSVs \n4 INFO NOTE\nhelp develop solutions to anticipated future impacts \nof climate change. No regret options are developed in \nanticipation of climate change.\nThe CSV approach is a collaborative effort designed to \ntest and identify appropriate interventions, \ninnovations, and policies which are not only technically \nappropriate but also gender- and socially-sensitive. In \nCSVs, rural communities partner with local \ngovernments, national programs, and international \nresearch and development organizations to develop \nvillages as models for local research and development. \nThey provide platforms for multi-stakeholder \nparticipation and collaborative work in targeted, \nclearly delineated geographic areas (\u201cterritories\u201d or \n\u201csmall landscapes\u201d).\n \nCSVs are \u201clighthouses\u201d where communities strengthen \nexisting farming systems and enrich them with CSA \npractices and technologies. Climate resilience thinking \nis already noted in communities as demonstrated by \nfarmers The approach rides and builds on mcurrent \nsystems, enhancing diversification, nutrient cycling, \nfood safety, and market linkages.\nCSVs feature incremental development and adaptation \napproaches\nCSVs consider not only the farms but the \nlandscapes as well\n \nCSA/CRA is usually best undertaken across \nlandscapes because ecosystems are interconnected. \nBy conserving and improving forest and water \nresources, nutrient flows to farms on lower slopes are \nlikewise enhanced. Landscapes are useful organizing \nframeworks for operationalizing climate-smart/\nresilient agriculture on the ground. Landscape \napproaches help us better understand the multi-\nfunctionality of agriculture and links to forests, water, \nand other natural resources. Climate, Environment, \nand Ecosystem elements interact with farms and \nlocal communities in a small landscape or micro-\nwatershed setting. These natural resource boundaries \nare important because of the ecosystem influences \non climate adaptation and resilience building \nobjectives of a CSVs.\nCollective action on a wider scale is usually necessary \nfor successful local adaptation programs (e.g., no \nburning of rice straw campaign, watershed \nrehabilitation, etc.). The interface between forestry \nand agriculture is blurred in such approaches requiring \nmultidisciplinary and convergence approaches. \nGroups processes are involved. Learning methods \nrecognize that farmers and local communities have \nlimited time for a series of structured courses. Instead, \nexperiential learning and sharing is featured. With a \ndeepening engagement, more sophisticated methods \nof learning might be considered.\nCSVs at local levels (villages and municipalities) are \nideal locations for harmonising and converging \nagricultural and natural resource management and \ngovernance inputs. Using participatory land use \nplanning approaches, communities can be assisted to \ndevelop local adaptation plans to address climate- \nrelated risk.\nCSVs are unique in that they provide space for the \ntesting of shortlisted options (derived from on-station \nresearch, local indigenous and technical knowledge, \netc.). This eventually leads to the prioritization of best \noptions for particular geographic areas. CSVs also help \ngenerate methodological innovations.\nThough CSVs are focal points for action research (or \nlighthouses for learning and sharing), they should not \nremain as islands of innovations. Wider adoption of \ninnovations needs to be ensured. They should \u201cnot \n[be] a showcase but a pattern\u201c. The integrity of the \nCSV as a unit for action research should not be \ncompromised. Otherwise, its emphasis on generating \nlocal evidence is lost. It is important for the CSV \nproponent to clarify the role and purpose of doing \nCSVs and specify their intended scope and scale of \napplication. The question of scale must be understood \nin the context of what is driving the need for a CSV.\n \n5INFO NOTE\nConclusion\nLocal adaptation platforms help empower sub-national and local government players, civil society organizations, \nand public-private partnerships in demonstrating the validity of agro-ecology-specifi c solutions to current and \nfuture climate change impacts. Such adaptation platforms are invariably diverse in their portfolio addressing \nmultiple needs and purposes. Development-oriented CSVs feature scaling, social inclusiveness, and sustainability.\nCSVs serve as centers for discovery, adaptation, learning, and sharing. They serve as basis for documentation and \nfi eld level advocacy. Adaptation research, which is a basic element of a CSV, helps build and nurture local \ncapacities at diff erent levels. Local communities of practice are encouraged to continue to innovate, experiment, \nand adapt (incrementally or step by step). Communities that have had a successful community-level adaptation \nmanagement experience are likely to adapt better to future changes. In a CSV, we ultimately need to ask ourselves \nwhose needs are being addressed. Achieving outcomes such as reduced poverty, enhanced resilience, improved \nlivelihoods, and better nutrition should be the primary considerations. After all, CSVs are not about doing business \nas usual! CSVs feature ways of achieving both scale and sustainability in a socially inclusive manner.\nReference:\nUNFCCC. (2012).

IntroductionAfter years of observing government failures to make decisions aimed at mitigating the adverseeffects of human-forced climate change, leaders of the world religions and advocacy groups focused onthe 21st Conference of the Parties (COP 21) to the United Nations Framework Convention Frameworkon Climate Change held near Paris, France in December 2015. Prominent among the leaders wereRabbi Arthur Waskow, Pope Francis, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, and a group of Islamicimams, leaders of non-government organizations, and scholars. Prior to and parallel with COP 21,these leaders and organizations associated with their religions expressed their faith-based motivationsfor urging and implementing informed decisions. They subsequently reminded nations of their moralobligation to ratify the Paris Agreement and sign their commitments on 22 April 2016, Earth Day.This article explores the religious rationales of these leaders when urging adherents of theirfaiths and decision-makers at all levels of governance to act on the perils that scientists have beenidentifying in the present and predicting for the future with various levels of certainty. Clearly, thesereligious leaders value scientific findings from which to draw conclusions and advocate action locallyto internationally. Scientists who are aware of the religious motivation of these leaders and will find inthem allies who share a mutual goal\u2014a flourishing Earth.Explored in the following sections are the religious leaders\u2019 faith-based rationales for advocatingaction on climate change. I begin with Rabbi Arthur Waskow and proceed to examine documents issuedby Pope Francis, Patriarch Bartholomew, and the Islamic clerics, organizational leaders, and scholarswho crafted and signed the Islamic Declaration on Global Climate Change. Following my examinationof each leader\u2019s statements, I identify and discuss a major group that shares the religious leader\u2019sGeosciences 2016, 6, 31; doi:10.3390/geosciences6030031 www.mdpi.com/journal/geosciencesGeosciences 2016, 6, 31 2 of 19faith and point to the activities in which the members engage that are most pertinent to addressingclimate change. The discussion concludes with encouragement to Earth scientists to recognize thatthese leaders and organizations value scientific findings and essentially function as allies in the goal tomitigate the adverse effects of human-forced climate change.2. Rabbi Arthur Waskow, Jewish Renewal Movement, and Climate ChangeA prominent researcher, prolific writer, stimulating lecturer, and dynamic organizer of The ShalomCenter, Rabbi Arthur Waskow, Ph.D. has dedicated over forty years to reviving and applying Jewishthought and traditions to ecological concerns across the major denominations of Judaism\u2014Orthodox,Conservative, Reformed, and Reconstructionist [1]. Particularly impressive is his development of\u201cEco-Judaism\u201d in theology, liturgy, daily practice, and activism. Spurred by his religious faith, he haspracticed non-violent civil disobedience at the White House and the U.S. Congress to highlight theperils of human-forced climate change, and he has collaborated with leaders and followers of otherreligious faiths in addressing climate change and related ecological issues. Popularly referred to as\u201cthe Green Rabbi\u201d, he was named a \u201cWisdom Keeper\u201d by the United Nations in 1996 [2].As Rabbi Waskow\u2019s exemplary efforts prior to, during, and after COP 21 indicate, Judaism isreplete with textual and liturgical sources upon which to draw for confronting human causes ofclimate change and for acting to mitigate their adverse effects. He finds in the Hebrew Bible beliefsabout God, human responsibility to God, Earth, and the universe, and he applies them to ecologicalconcerns informed by contemporary scientific findings. Key to these beliefs is the Jewish commitmentto honor their covenantal relationship with God, with one-another, and with Earth. To underscorethe significance of this covenantal web of relatedness, he weaves it into Jewish celebrations to focuson particular problems and to initiate action. For example, during Tu B\u2019Shevat, the Jewish festival ofthe rebirthing of trees in midwinter, Rabbi Waskow led an effort to defend ancient redwoods againstdestruction. Another was orienting B\u2019nei Mitzvah, a rite of passage and joyful Jewish celebration whenchildren become young men and women, as a time for underscoring their intergenerational covenant toprevent global climate disaster. Others include special Earth foci for Passover/Palm Sunday, Tisha B\u2019Av,Sukkot, and Hanukkah, the Interfaith Freedom Seder for Earth, \u201ceco-kosher\u201d practices for consumingfood and other gifts as an affirmation of their sacred relationship with Earth, and the Green Menorahorganizing project and award to congregations for environmental activism [3].Jewish faith-based sources are drawn upon throughout A Rabbinic Letter on the Climate Crisis:To the Jewish People, to all Communities of Spirit, and to the World [4] that Rabbi Waskow initiatedwith six leading rabbis who represent the aforementioned Jewish denominations. Anticipating PopeFrancis\u2019s imminent release of a major document on ecological concerns, other rabbis were alerted to theopportunity to sign the letter beginning 1 May 2015 [5]. By the time the pope\u2019s encyclical was releasedto the public on 18 June 2015 [6], 408 rabbis from the United States and Canada, The Netherlands, Brazil,The United Kingdom, and Israel had signed the letter. Additional signatories included cantors, rabbinicstudents, and spiritual directors who asked to join the rabbis in signing the document, bringing thetotal to 472 [7].What motivated them to express their concerns about climate change and commit to acting onthem? In A Rabbinic Letter on the Climate Crisis, the rabbis explain their deep concern that damagingGod\u2019s creation violates their covenantal relationship with God the Creator. Throughout the HebrewBible, the inspired writers underscored the earth as belonging to God and the responsibility ofthe faithful to care for God\u2019s creation as specified in the Genesis 2 story of creation and impliedin the Genesis 1 story. The ancient Israelites solidified their relationship with God in a series ofcovenants\u2013agreements with God that lovingly united them with God forever. In their letter, the rabbisemphasize their \u201cgreat respect\u201d for scientific facts about human activities that are emitting greenhousegases into the atmosphere and causing \u201cunprecedented floods, droughts, ice-melts, snowstorms, heatwaves, typhoons, sea-level rises, and the expansion of disease-bearing insects from \u2018tropical\u2019 zonesGeosciences 2016, 6, 31 3 of 19into what used to be \u2018temperate\u2019 regions\u201d are alarming, and scientific projections of the future that\u201ceven worse will happen if we continue with carbon-burning business as usual\u201d.For the rabbis, the present reality and projected threats to Earth are alarming. They view theuniverse as God\u2019s creation, the place for experiencing the unfolding mystery of God\u2019s presence inthe world, \u201cthe presence of the divine hand in every earthly creature\u201d, and \u201cthe Breath of Life thatinterweaves\u201d all creatures. They lament the desecration of the \u201cwonder and this beauty\u201d of God\u2019screation. They are \u201cespecially moved\u201d by scientific findings that resonate with texts of the HebrewBible about healing the relationships of Earth and \u201chuman earthlings, adamah and adam\u201d. The biblicaltexts to which they refer are Leviticus 25\u201326 and Deuteronomy 15 that call for one year of every sevento be a Sabbatical Year, a year of rest for the land, for workers, and for the release of debtors from theirdebts. Leviticus 26 requires allowing the land to rest and warns that it will \u201crest\u201d nevertheless \u201cthroughdrought and famine and exile that turn an entire people into refugees\u201d. According to the rabbis:This ancient warning heard by one indigenous people in one slender land has now becomea crisis of our planet as a whole and of the entire human species. Human behavior thatoverworks the Earth\u2014especially the overburning of fossil fuels\u2014crests in a systemicplanetary response that endangers human communities and many other life-forms as well.Seeking guidance in their wisdom traditions to prevent disasters from occurring and to heal theirrelationship with Earth, they underscore the presence of God who dwells within as well as beyond theuniverse, the \u201cinterwovenness\u201d of all life, and God\u2019s partaking in this interweaving.By overburning carbon dioxide and methane into our planet\u2019s air, we have disturbed thesacred balance in which we breathe in what the trees breathe out, and the trees breathe inwhat we breathe out. The upshot: global scorching, climate crisis.They recognize that the crisis is worsened by \u201cthe spread of extreme extraction of fossil fuels\u201d thatcauses global warming and directly damages specific regions. Particular problems to which they pointinclude: Hydraulic fracturing for oil that poisons water supplies; coal burning that causes asthmain neighborhoods of people who are often the poorest and \u201cthe Blackest\u201d; coal mining that destroysmountains in West Virginia; extracting and pipe-lining tar sands that threaten Native Americancommunities and endanger farmers and cowboys; and drilling for oil deep into the Gulf of Mexico andoff Prince William Sound that has killed workers and marine life and caused financial disasters forpeople and whole communities. The rabbis anticipate additional death and destruction if drilling foroil in the Arctic and Atlantic oceans is approved.The climate crisis signals to the rabbis the need to heal their relationship with Earth and to seekjustice for the poor who are \u201cthe first and the worst to suffer from the typhoons, floods, droughts, anddiseases\u201d caused by global warming. They call for \u201ca new sense of eco-social justice\u201d for addressingthe climate crisis, because \u201cjustice and earthiness cannot be disentangled\u201d. Furthermore, Earth hasbeen overworked and must be allowed to \u201crest\u201d, the rabbis insist. Letting Earth rest is required by theircovenantal relationship with God and their responsibility to God. Letting Earth rest is also essentialout of a sense of justice for \u201cour children and their children\u201d.Turning to how this crisis should be mitigated, they identify specific actions to take in theirhomes, congregations, denominations, and federations. Among these actions are purchasing electricitygenerated by renewable energy sources, offering grants and loans to solarize buildings, investing inBlack, Hispanic, and other poor communities, moving endowment funds from \u201ccarbon to life-givingenterprises\u201d, advocating a halt to fossil fuel tax subsidies by governments, a swift deployment ofrenewable energy technologies, and a system of carbon fees and public dividends that reward movingbeyond the carbon economy. The rabbis hope that \u201ccommunities of moral commitment, religiouscovenant, and spiritual search\u201d will act on the climate crisis as they did during the Civil Rightsmovement. To encourage Jewish communities to act, the rabbis called them to gather during Sukkot on4 October 2015 to explore their responsibilities \u201ctoward the Earth and all humankind\u201d.Geosciences 2016, 6, 31 4 of 19Efforts to address climate change continue through The Shalom Center that Rabbi Waskowfounded in 1983 and continues to energize today. Described as \u201cA prophetic voice in Jewish,multireligious, and American life\u201d, The Shalom Center is based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvaniawhere staff network with other Jewish organizations and with interfaith groups on effective ways ofconfronting the climate crisis [8]. Among the Jewish organizations that network with The ShalomCenter are the Coalition on Environment and Jewish Life, the Green Zionist Alliance, and the JewishEnergy Covenant Campaign. These three organizations collaborated in developing the \u201cGreen EnergyGuide\u201d for using energy efficiently and appropriately in all areas of Jewish life, promoting the use ofrenewable energy sources, encouraging decreased reliance on fossil fuels while cautioning againstnuclear-fueled electricity production, and advocating a clean energy future for Israel [9]. The ShalomCenter also interacts with the Jewish Council for Public Affairs which continues to urge elected officialsin the United States to contribute to the United Nations Green Climate Fund [10]. The shared religiousfaith of the dedicated members of these organizations fuels their creative networking efforts. Theirtraditional celebrations around the Jewish calendar provide opportunities for remembering why theyare engaged in confronting the climate crisis and aiming for an efficient and renewable energy future.3. Pope Francis, Roman Catholicism, and Climate ChangeLaudato Si\u2019, On Care for Our Common Home [6] was the encyclical that the authors and signers ofA Rabbinic Letter on the Climate Crisis anticipated. Signed on 24 May 2015 by Pope Francis, the primaryleader of approximately 1.2 billion people who identify with the Roman Catholic Church. Laudato Si\u2019addresses air pollution, climate change, clean water availability, and the loss of biological diversityas problems that have profound ramifications for the poor, the vulnerable, and future generations.Though I focus on his teachings pertaining to climate change, the other problems are affected by theclimate crisis and it affects them.Pope Francis had lamented the current and projected effects of climate change from the beginningof his pontificate in March 2013 [11]. However, his issuing this encyclical signified an advancementin Catholic social teachings on the human-Earth relationship. Encyclicals have been issued by popessince 1891 to provide a Catholic, Christian faith perspective on problematic social issues that Catholicsare required to consider and discern a response. Among the major teachings are respecting thedignity of the human person, seeking the common good, and demonstrating preference for poor andvulnerable people [12]. Though prior popes had mentioned ecological degradation as a moral concernin their encyclicals and two had issued statements alerting the faithful to their moral responsibility foraddressing them [13,14], Laudato Si\u2019 was the first encyclical dedicated to ecological problems and theirresolution through all levels of governance.In the first chapter, Pope Francis overviews scientific evidence for an imperiled planet, our\u201ccommon home\u201d. He focuses directly on climate change in four sections (23 through 26) of the246 sections that comprise Laudato Si\u2019. He begins by declaring: \u201cThe climate is a common good,belonging to all and meant for all\u201d (\u00a723). Well-informed by scientific findings, he proceeds to describethe climate crisis as reported by scientists who are engaged in climate research:At the global level, it is a complex system linked to many of the essential conditions forhuman life. A very solid scientific consensus indicates that we are presently witnessinga disturbing warming of the climatic system. In recent decades this warming has beenaccompanied by a constant rise in the sea level and, it would appear, by an increase ofextreme weather events, even if a scientifically determinable cause cannot be assigned toeach particular phenomenon (\u00a723).He recognizes natural factors that are causing changes in the climate, including \u201cvolcanic activity,variations in the earth\u2019s orbit and axis, the solar cycle.\u201d However, he concludes from scientific studiesthat \u201cmost global warming in recent decades is due to the great concentration of greenhouse gasesreleased mainly as a result of human activity\u201d. Aggravating this problem, he insists, is \u201ca model ofGeosciences 2016, 6, 31 5 of 19development based on the intensive use of fossil fuels, which is at the heart of the worldwide energysystem\u201d (\u00a723). Cutting forests for agricultural purposes further aggravates global warming as scientistshave concluded.The rise in Earth\u2019s temperature has adversely affected the availability of drinking water,agricultural production, biological diversity, the acidity of the oceans, and the marine food chain.Based on these scientific findings, he concludes:If present trends continue, this century may well witness extraordinary climate change andan unprecedented destruction of ecosystems, with serious consequences for all of us. Arise in the sea level, for example, can create extremely serious situations, if we considerthat a quarter of the world\u2019s population lives on the coast or nearby, and that the majorityof our megacities are situated in coastal areas (\u00a724).For Pope Francis, climate change persists as \u201cone of the principal challenges facing humanity inour day\u201d, and it has grave environmental, social, economic, political implications (\u00a724). He is especiallyconcerned about the most vulnerable areas and people who live there:Its worst impact will probably be felt by developing countries in coming decades. Many ofthe poor live in areas particularly affected by phenomena related to warming, and theirmeans of subsistence are largely dependent on natural reserves and ecosystemic servicessuch as agriculture, fishing and forestry. They have no other financial activities or resourceswhich can enable them to adapt to climate change or to face natural disasters, and theiraccess to social services and protection is very limited (\u00a725).Among the most vulnerable are migrants who, forced to leave their homes due to changesin the climate, are not recognized as refugees by international conventions, do not have any legalprotection, and suffer great uncertainty about the future of their families. Indifference to their sufferingis widespread, he cautions. He attributes this indifference to the loss of a \u201csense of responsibility\u201d forothers\u2014a sense of responsibility that stimulated the development of civil society (\u00a725).Fearing that these and other adverse effects of climate change will worsen under the currentmodels of production and consumption, the pope urges all nations to develop policies that willdrastically reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases and expeditiously substitute renewable energysources and energy efficiency for fossil fuels. He notes that some nations have progressed toward arenewable and more efficient energy future, but they constitute only a minority (\u00a726). He also alerts alleconomically developed nations of their responsibility to assist poor and developing nations towardthe goal of a renewable and efficient energy future. From his religious faith perspective, all constitute\u201cone single family\u201d. There are \u201cno frontiers or barriers, political or social\u201d behind which any nation canhide. Nor is there any room for a \u201cglobalization of indifference\u201d toward the poor and vulnerable (\u00a752).Pope Francis recognizes that there are \u201cdifferent approaches and lines of thought\u201d that haveemerged regarding climate change and urges dialogue to develop \u201ccomprehensive solutions\u201d (\u00a760).Admitting that the Catholic Church \u201chas no reason to offer a definitive opinion\u201d (\u00a761), he points to thedire scientific facts that require informed action:[W]e need only take a frank look at the facts to see that our common home is falling intoserious disrepair. Hope would have us recognize that there is always a way out, that wecan always redirect our steps, that we can always do something to solve our problems. Still,we can see signs that things are now reaching a breaking point, due to the rapid pace ofchange and degradation; these are evident in large-scale natural disasters as well as socialand even financial crises, for the world\u2019s problems cannot be analyzed or explained inisolation. There are regions now at high risk and, aside from all doomsday predictions, thepresent world system is certainly unsustainable from a number of points of view (\u00a761).Geosciences 2016, 6, 31 6 of 19Many perspectives must be brought into the conversation to reach a comprehensive solution aboutclimate change, and the pope offers a religious perspective as an example of one way of \u201cinterpretingand transforming reality\u201d (\u00a763):If we are truly concerned to develop an ecology capable of remedying the damage we havedone, no branch of the sciences and no form of wisdom can be left out, and that includesreligion and the language particular to it. The Catholic Church is open to dialogue withphilosophical thought; this has enabled her to produce various syntheses between faithand reason (\u00a763).Expressing respect for other traditions and welcoming \u201cdialogue with everyone\u201d (\u00a764), heproceeds to show how the Catholic faith motivates Christians \u201cto care for nature and for the mostvulnerable of their brothers and sisters\u201d (\u00a764).Pope Francis draws from biblical and theological sources to highlights the goodness of God\u2019screation and God\u2019s valuing all creatures (\u00a765), God\u2019s having created out of love (\u00a765), God\u2019s lovefor each creature which unites all \u201cin fond affection\u201d (\u00a792), and God\u2019s self-revelation through thevisible universe\u2013the \u201cbook of nature\u201d which \u201cspeaks\u201d of God\u2019s love (\u00a784). The pope also highlightsthe dignity of the human person and the harmonious relationship that each is intended to have withhis/her neighbor, Earth and God (\u00a7\u00a766\u201367) and human responsibility to care for God\u2019s creation (\u00a768),to cooperate with God in the ongoing work of creation (\u00a780), to praise God for all creatures and\u201cto worship\u201d God \u201cin union with them\u201d (\u00a787), to experience God\u2019s presence through the creation(\u00a788), and to experience \u201ca sense of deep communion with the rest of nature (\u00a791), a \u201cuniversalcommunion\u201d, and a \u201csense of fraternity [that] excludes nothing and no one\u201d (\u00a792). He culminates thechapter with reflections on Jesus\u2019 recognition of God\u2019s \u201cpaternal relationship\u201d with all creatures (\u00a796),attention to their beauty (\u00a797), living in harmony with them (\u00a798), and \u201cdirecting them toward theirfullness\u201d (\u00a7100).As a theologian who has researched the Catholic theological tradition in depth and foundpromising foundations for ecological ethics, I know that Pope Francis has appropriated many ofthe best [15]. He provides a rationale for Christians to value all creatures intrinsically, to appreciatetheir beauty, to feel deeply intertwined with them in the web of existence, and to cooperate with themfor their mutual flourishing. He proceeds in subsequent parts of Laudato Si\u2019 to identify componentsthat must be integrated in order to arrive at a comprehensive solution to the environmental crisis. Thiscrisis is complex, he insists realistically, because there are intertwined ecological and social dimensionsthat must be considered.Among the components he identifies sequentially that have particular relevance for addressingclimate change are the \u201cintrinsic dignity of the world\u201d (\u00a7115), the intrinsic value of ecosystems\u201cindependent of their usefulness\u201d to humans (\u00a7140), rethinking \u201cthe goals, effects, and overall contextand ethical limits\u201d of human activity (\u00a7132), the complexity of ecosystems and their networks (\u00a7134),humans as \u201cpart of nature, included in it, and thus in constant interaction with it\u201d (\u00a7139), considerationfor the poor and vulnerable who are most adversely affected by climate change that their activities didnot force and \u201cspecial care for indigenous communities and their cultural traditions\u201d (\u00a7146), seekingthe common good of all (\u00a7\u00a7156\u2013158), the perils to future generations if greenhouse gas emissionsare not reduced (\u00a7169), the injustice of requiring poor and developing countries to reduce emissionscomparable to more industrialized countries that have caused the climate crisis (\u00a7170), the need fordecision-makers to courageously counter short-term mindsets with long-term responsibility (\u00a7181),transparency in decision-making and striving for consensus (\u00a7183), and redefining the notion ofprogress to include quality of life (\u00a7194). Underlying these components are attitudes that must changeand actions that must be taken in all areas of human functioning.Thus, addressing human-forced climate change and the other environmental issues requiresno less than an \u201cecological conversion\u201d, Pope Francis insists. The conversion he envisions is fromself-centered consumerism, wastefulness, ecological degradation and destruction, thinking of ourselvesGeosciences 2016, 6, 31 7 of 19apart from and dominating other creatures, allowing the economic\u2013technological paradigm to driveour decision-making, and failing to care about and for the poor and vulnerable whose suffering isexacerbated by the many manifestations of ecological degradation to recognizing our destructiveindividual and collective actions that are harming vulnerable people, other creatures and Earth,realizing that we are interconnected with them, seeking reconciliation with them, and joining all in \u201casplendid universal communion\u201d of loving awareness in our thoughts, attitudes, and actions (\u00a7220).Pope Francis offers Christians some suggestions for an ecological spirituality that is grounded intheir faith and may motivate their \u201cmore passionate concern for the protection of our world\u201d (\u00a7216).Pointing to his namesake, the 12th century Saint Francis of Assisi, who had a \u201chealthy relationship withcreation\u201d, the pope urged Christians to recognize \u201cerrors, sins, faults and failures\u201d, to seek a \u201cheartfeltrepentance and desire to change\u201d (\u00a7218). Because problems \u201cmust be addressed by communitynetworks and not simply by the sum of individual good deeds\u201d, the \u201cecological conversion needed tobring about lasting change is also a community conversion\u201d (\u00a7219). Thus, the ecological conversionthat he envisions is both interior and exterior. It is a conversion that begins within the person andis demonstrated outwardly through action in solidarity with others. For Pope Francis, an ecologicalconversion manifests the \u201csublime fraternity with all creation which Saint Francis of Assisi so radiantlyembodied\u201d (\u00a7221).Pope Francis\u2019s call to action has energized over 900,000 Catholics and 300 Catholic organizationsthroughout the world that network as the Global Catholic Climate Movement out of a \u201cshared senseof responsibility to care for God\u2019s beautiful, life-giving creation\u201d [16]. United by their religious faithand inspired by Pope Francis, his predecessors, and fellow bishops, the Movement describes itselfas guided by the virtue of prudence (\u201cright reason applied to action\u201d) and accepting findings bythe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that greenhouse gas emissions are contributing to\u201charmful changes to the planetary systems\u201d which endanger God\u2019s creation and all people\u2014especiallythe poor [17]. After having appealed to all nations to sign the Parish Agreement, the Movement isleading an effort to reach all national and local governments in the world with this basic message:Climate change affects everyone, but especially the poor and most vulnerable peopleamong us. Inspired by Pope Francis and the Laudato Si' encyclical, we call on you todrastically cut carbon emissions to keep the global temperature rise below the dangerous1.5 \u02ddC threshold, and to aid the world\u2019s poorest in coping with climate change impacts [18].One of the organizational members of the Global Catholic Climate Movement that is mostprominent in the United States is the Catholic Climate Covenant [19] which partners with the U.S.Conference of Catholic Bishops, Catholic Relief Services, religious orders, and other major Catholicorganizations [20]. Among the many achievements of the Covenant are initiating the St. Francis Pledgethrough which individuals and institutions commit to mitigate the climate crisis [21], collaboratingwith the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops to stimulate scholarly thinking about the climate crisisand disseminating educational materials to parishes throughout the United States aimed at informingtheir approximately 70 million Catholics [22], and commissioning twenty-five Catholic ClimateAmbassadors to teach about human-forced climate change and advocate its resolution [23].Months prior to the issuance of Laudato Si\u2019, Covenant staff gathered representatives of twentyCatholic organizations in the Washington DC area to plan a coordinated response to the media, thecirculation of synopses of the encyclical, initiation of encyclical study guides for parish use, andactions aimed at advocating national action on climate change. Staff representing various levelsof Catholic community life were involved in this planning\u2014departments at the U.S. Conference ofCatholic Bishops, dioceses, catechetical offices, institutions of higher learning, and religious orders(e.g., Franciscans and Jesuits). The week prior to and months after the encyclical was issued, Covenantstaff worked with other Catholic organizations to call attention to Pope Francis\u2019s teachings in theencyclical and his speeches during his visit to the United States in September 2015 and the Vatican\u2019sefforts during the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention onClimate Change held near Paris in December 2015. The Covenant also participated in efforts to urgeGeosciences 2016, 6, 31 8 of 19the U.S. Congress to contribute to the Green Climate Fund, act on legislation to curb the use of fossilfuels, promote energy efficiency, and move toward a renewable energy future. Covenant staff andpartners continue to educate on climate change and advocate action at all levels of Catholic life [24].Many efforts are underway within dioceses of the United States to study and reflect on Laudato Si\u2019and to apply the teachings of the encyclical to parish life. One example is an action plan within theArchdiocese of Atlanta for implementing Laudato Si\u2019 that was prepared by professors at the Universityof Georgia at the request of Atlanta\u2019s Archbishop Wilton D. Gregory. The plan provides a varietyof options for energy conservation and efficiency, transportation, water consumption, sustainablelandscaping, recycling, assisting vulnerable populations, and political action that parishes and familiescan consider initiating [25]. Among the guides for studying the encyclical and applying it individuallyand in parish life is Laudato Si\u2019 Study & Action Guide for Individuals & Small Groups prepared by theColumban Center for Advocacy and Outreach based in Washington DC [26]. The extent to which theseefforts will reach the 70 million Catholics in the United States will be determined in large part by thebishops of dioceses and the priests of parishes within those dioceses due to the diffusive nature ofauthority and responsibility in the Catholic Church [27].4. Patriarch Bartholomew, Eastern Orthodox Christianity, and Climate ChangeIn Laudato Si\u2019, Pope Francis lauded the efforts of Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew ofConstantinople [28] who has been raising awareness of biological diversity loss, the degradationand destruction of ecological systems, and threats to the life-sustaining capacity of Earth from thebeginning of his patriarchate in 1991 to the present. Several expeditions of religious leaders, scientists,environmentalists, journalists, and policy makers that he has led to imperiled rivers and seas (e.g.,the Danube, Amazon, and Mississippi rivers and the Mediterranean, Black, Baltic, and Adriatic seas)have attracted world-wide attention [29] (pp. 10\u201315), but his prominence escalated, especially amongthe media and environmental organizations, when he categorized ecologically destructive actionsas sinful:For human beings to cause species to become extinct and to destroy the biological diversityof God\u2019s creation; for human beings to degrade the integrity of the earth by causingchanges in its climate, by stripping the earth of its natural forests, or destroying itswetlands; for human beings to injure other human beings with disease; for human beings tocontaminate the earth\u2019s waters, its land, its air, and its life, with poisonous substances\u2013theseare sins [30] (p. 99).The first religious leader to proclaim the sinfulness of ecologically destructive acts, PatriarchBartholomew urged prayer and repentance \u201cfor the forgiveness of sins committed both willingly andunwillingly. And it is certainly God\u2019s forgiveness, which we must ask, for causing harm to His owncreation\u201d (p. 99).The \u201cGreen Patriarch\u201d concluded to the sinfulness of environmental degradation in 1997approximately seven weeks prior to the opening of the 3rd Conference of the Parties to the UNFramework Convention on Climate Change in Kyoto, Japan. After explaining the religious basis forhow people who believe in God should act\u2014a basis shared by other symposium participants\u2014andreferring to the upcoming conference in Kyoto, he exclaimed:It is with that understanding that we call on the world\u2019s leaders to take action to halt thedestructive changes to the global climate that are being caused by human activity. And wecall on all of you here today to join us in this cause. This can be our important contributionto the great debate about climate change. We must be spokespeople for an ecological ethicthat reminds the world that it is not ours to use for our own convenience. It is God\u2019s gift oflove to us and we must return his love by protecting it and all that is in it (p.100).That the world is God\u2019s \u201cgift of love\u201d is key to understanding the traditional OrthodoxChristian theology and spirituality that ground Patriarch Bartholomew\u2019s commitment to environmentalGeosciences 2016, 6, 31 9 of 19protection. From the Orthodox perspective, the true nature of God is love, God created the world outof love, and the world is like an icon\u2014a symbol of God the Creator\u2014through which the faithful areinvited to contemplate God [29] (pp. 20\u201321). The world is where the \u201cdivine and human meet in theslightest detail contained in the seamless garment of God\u2019s creation, in the last speck of dust\u201d [31].The relationship of humans to the world as a gift does not mean that it is a possession, thepatriarch teaches. As God\u2019s gift, there are \u201ccertain boundaries established by the giver\u201d, and withinthese boundaries are two conditions: One is \u201cto protect the gift\u201d that is the world so it is preservedfrom harm. The second condition is to show \u201cself-restraint\u201d (enkrateia) when consuming its goods [32](p. 107). Understanding the world as a symbol through which God is contemplated and as a gift fromGod to protect and use with restraint are teachings that permeate Patriarch Bartholomew\u2019s homilies,addresses, and statements.Protecting God\u2019s gift of the creation is a spiritual responsibility, he insists [29] (p. 4). He followshis predecessor, Ecumenical Patriarch Dimitrios, who had established the first day of September as aday for all Orthodox Christians to offer prayers for protection and preservation of God\u2019s creation (p. 6).In 2015, Pope Francis joined this Eastern Orthodox celebration by declaring 1 September the WorldDay of Prayer for all Catholic Christians [33].Bringing Orthodox, Catholic, and other Christian leaders together to raise ecological awarenesshas been a hallmark of the Bartholomew\u2019s patriarchate. To facilitate understanding environmentalproblems, he began early in his ecclesial position to seek scientific information about ecologicaldegradation, the loss of biological diversity, and threats to the biosphere of Earth. He established theReligion and Scientific Committee in 1994 to \u201cshare the responsibility for our pollution of the earthand the obligation to find tangible ways of healing the natural environment\u201d [29] (p. 9). His reflectionsand teachings on the climate crisis well demonstrate his reliance on scientific findings to address thisvexing problem.In his address at the opening of the World Exposition in Aichi, Japan, in September 2005, thepatriarch expressed his alarm over the adverse effects of climate change and environmental pollutionon \u201ceveryone\u201d [34] p. 221). The information from the scientific community is \u201cclearly unsettling\u201d fromhis perspective. He continued with one example:Dramatic increases of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere\u2013largely due to fossil fuelburning\u2014are causing global warming and in turn leading to melting ice caps, rising sealevels, and spread of disease, drought, and famine. The European heat wave of 2003 couldbe unusually cool by 2060, while the 150,000 people that the World Health Organizationconservatively estimates are already dying annually because of climate change will be buta fraction of the actual number\u201d (p. 211).A response to this \u201cscientific testimony\u201d by religious communities \u201chas been generally reluctantand gravely inadequate\u201d, he admitted. \u201cUnless we take radical and immediate measures to reduceemissions stemming from unsustainable...excesses in the demands of our lifestyle, the impact will beboth alarming and imminent\u201d (p. 211).The ethical ramifications of climate change go beyond environmental preservation, he insistedduring his address in Japan:Religious leaders throughout the world recognize that climate change is much more thanan issue of environmental preservation. Insofar as it is human-induced, it is a profoundlymoral and spiritual problem. To persist in the current path of ecological destruction is notonly folly. It is no less than suicidal, jeopardizing the diversity of the very earth that weinhabit, enjoy, and share. Indeed, we have repeatedly described it as a sin against both theCreator and creation (pp. 211\u2013212).When pointing to \u201ca handful of affluent nations\u201d that account for \u201ctwo-thirds of global DGP andhalf of all global carbon dioxide emissions\u201d, he held affluent nations accountable for the effects of theiremissions and, at least implicitly, placed their decisions makers among the sinful (p. 212).Geosciences 2016, 6, 31 10 of 19In a joint statement with the late Pope John Paul II in 2002, Patriarch Bartholomew identifiedclimate change as \u201ca matter of social and economic justice\u201d [35]:For those who will most directly and severely be affected by climate change will be thepoorer and more vulnerable nations(what Christian Scriptures refer to as our \u201cneighbor\u201d) aswell as the younger and future generations (the world of our children, and of our children\u2019schildren) (pp. 338\u2013339).The patriarch and the pope recognize the \u201cclose link between the economy of the poor and thewarming of our planet\u201d and the intimate connection between \u201cconservation and compassion\u201d:Conservation and compassion are intimately connected. The web of life is a sacredgift of God\u2013ever so precious and ever so delicate. We must serve our neighbor andpreserve our world with both humility and generosity, in a pespective of frugality andsolidarity alike (p. 339).The two religious leaders also agreed on their need for action within their respectivedenominations. They recognized that they \u201cmust undoubtedly put their own houses inorder\u201d, and \u201ctheir adherents must embrace the urgency of the issue\u201d:This process has already begun, although it must be intensified. Religions realize theprimacy of the need for a deep change with people\u2019s hearts. They are also emphasizingthe connection between spiritual commitment and moral ecological practice. Faithcommunities are well placed to take a long-term view of the world as God\u2019s creation (p. 339).Building on their shared Christian faith, they acknowledged the need to act in solidarity withvulnerable people who are most adversely affected by changes in the global climate:[W]e have been taught that we are judged on the choices we make. Our virtue can neverbe assessed in isolation from others but is always measured in solidarity with the mostvulnerable. Breaking the vicious circle of economic stagnation and ecological degradationis a choice with which we are uniquely endowed at this crucial moment in the history ofour planet\u201d (p. 339).Clearly, these two religious leaders committed to working with one another to change thinkingand acting on climate change.In several statements during his tenure, Patriarch Bartholomew underscored the need for actingimmediately. One example is a message sent to representatives attending COP 19, the decision-makingbody of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, who were meeting in Warsaw, Poland in2013. On the heels of the devastating hurricane that swept the Philippines, he expressed his hope for\u201cprompt practical results\u201d to address the growing escalation of climate change [31]. Relating scientific,political, and religious perspectives, he warned about the consequences of continuing to fail to takeaction on climate change:There will come a point, and it may be very soon, when it is simply too late. Our scientiststalk of \u2018tipping points\u2019 and \u2018abrupt climate change.\u2019 Our political leaders talk of thechallenges that lie ahead. The Bible speaks of God\u2019s grace in giving us many, many chances.But it makes it clear the time will come for all of us when we have to face consequences ofour wrongdoing [36] (p. 349).Before it is too late, an \u201cact of repentance\u201d is required, the Patriarch continued, also \u201ca change inour established ways\u201d, a \u201ctransformation\u201d. To achieve this transformation requires \u201cnothing less thana radical reversal of our perspectives and practices\u201d [37] (p. 200).What are the \u201cradical\u201d reversals the Patriarch is urging? He urges replacing consumption withsacrifice, greed with generosity, wastefulness with a spirit of sharing, and an asceticism that \u201centailsGeosciences 2016, 6, 31 11 of 19learning to give, and not simply to give up\u201d. This transformation constitutes \u201ca way of loving, ofmoving gradually away from what I want to what God\u2019s world needs\u201d [38] (p. 203). Christians arealso called by God \u201cto accept the world as a sacrament of communion, as a way of sharing with Godand our neighbours on a global scale\u201d, and to live with the conviction that \u201cthe divine and the humanmeet in the slightest detail in the seamless garment of God\u2019s creation, in the last speck of dust of ourplanet\u201d [31].Clearly, Patriarch Bartholomew and Pope Francis share a similar approach to the transformationthat is needed to mitigate the climate crisis. The pope\u2019s appreciation for the Patriarch\u2019s thinking isobvious in Laudato Si\u2019, and the Patriarch\u2019s support for Laudato Si\u2019 was visibly demonstrated whensending his distinguished representative, Metropolitan John (Zizioulas) of Pergamon, to the Vaticanwhen the encyclical was issued publicly on 18 June 2015 [39]. This united front of Eastern Orthodoxyand Roman Catholicism on climate change may have some influence on the approximately 260 millionadherents of Eastern Orthodoxy and 1.2 billion Roman Catholics in the world.5. Islamic Clerics, Leaders, and Scholars on Climate ChangeIssued prior to COP 21, the Islamic Declaration on Global Climate Change [40] resulted from theInternational Climate Change Symposium held in Istanbul in August 2015 at which senior internationaldevelopment policy makers, leaders of faith groups, academics, and other Islamic experts sought\u201cbroad unity and ownership from the Islamic community\u201d for acting on the climate crisis [41]. A groupof \u201ctop academics\u201d had drafted the declaration and circulated it widely prior to the symposium wherethe draft was discussed and finalized [40].The symposium participants considered 2015 \u201ca watershed year for the climate movement\u201d inlight of the fact that government representatives would be converging in Paris where they are expectedto forge \u201ca new, international climate agreement that is robust, ambitious and commensurate with thescientific imperatives outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u201d. Convinced that\u201ca bigger, broader and stronger citizens\u2019 movement\u201d was essential to influence the nations\u2019 delegatesto forge an agreement that will mitigate the climate crisis, the symposium participants committed toconveying the Islamic faith perspective in a way that might inspire the COP nations toward a positiveoutcome of their deliberations.The Islamic faith-based rationale for confronting the climate crisis appears succinctly in thepreamble of the declaration:God\u2014Whom we know as Allah\u2014has created the universe in all its diversity, richness andvitality: the stars, the sun and moon, the earth and all its communities of living beings.All these reflect and manifest the boundless glory and mercy of their Creator. All createdbeings by nature serve and glorify their Maker, all bow to their Lord\u2019s will. We humanbeings are created to serve the Lord of all beings, to work the greatest good we can for allthe species, individuals, and generations of God\u2019s creatures.Following this statement of faith, the signatories reflected on scientific findings about the gradualfluctuations in the Earth\u2019s climate:Our planet has existed for billions of years and climate change in itself is not new. Theearth\u2019s climate has gone through phases wet and dry, cold and warm, in response tomany natural factors. Most of these changes have been gradual, so that the forms andcommunities of life have adjusted accordingly. There have been catastrophic climatechanges that brought about mass extinctions, but over time, life adjusted even to theseimpacts, flowering anew in the emergence of balanced ecosystems such as those we treasuretoday. Climate change in the past was also instrumental in laying down immense stores offossil fuels from which we derive benefits today.\u201d\u201cIronically\u201d, they continued, \u201cour unwise and short-sighted use of these resources is now resultingin the destruction of the very conditions that have made our life on earth possible\u201d. Humans haveGeosciences 2016, 6, 31 12 of 19become \u201ca force dominating nature\u201d that has ushered Earth into a new age that is currently describedin geological terms as the \u201cAnthropocene, or \u2018Age of Humans\u2019\u201d.This new age is highly problematic for Muslims who are committed to Islam, the signatoriesconclude. Humans are supposed to be caretakers of Earth, they are intended by God to \u201csavor\u201d the\u201cgifts\u201d of Earth, and they are accountable to God for their actions. However:Excessive pollution from fossil fuels threatens to destroy the gifts bestowed on us by God,whom we know as Allah\u2014gifts such as a functioning climate, healthy air to breathe, regularseasons, and living oceans. But our attitude to these gifts has been short-sighted, and wehave abused them. What will future generations say of us, who leave them a degradedplanet as our legacy? How will we face our Lord and Creator?The signatories point to manifestations of the \u201ccorruption...that humans have caused\u201d due to their\u201crelentless pursuit of economic growth and consumption\u201d. Global climate change is their \u201cpresentconcern\u201d, but also looming are the contamination and \u201cbefoulment of the atmosphere, land, inlandwater systems, and seas\u201d, the erosion of soil, \u201cdeforestation and desertification\u201d, and damage to humanhealth, including a host of modern-day diseases\u201d.Citing the past ten years of climate assessments by the United Nations Environment Programmeand the latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the signatories list reasonsfor their concerns about the over-use of fossil fuels that are forcing changes on the global climate:Ecosystems and human cultures that are currently at risk; extreme weather in the form of heatwaves, heavy precipitation, and coastal flooding; the poor and disadvantaged communities in allcountries that are most adversely affected; predictions of effects on biodiversity; adverse effects onecosystems and the overall global economy; and predictions of abrupt and irreversible changes in thecore physical systems of Earth. From these warnings, they conclude to the need for an \u201curgent andradical reappraisal\u201d of how humans are using fossil fuels, and they criticize the \u201cpresent deadlock\u201din international climate change negotiations that has occurred in the COPs to the U.N. FrameworkConvention on Climate Change.Furthermore, they express their alarm over the \u201crising per capita consumption combined withthe rising human population\u201d and \u201cthe multi-national scramble now taking place for more fossil fueldeposits under the dissolving ice caps in the arctic regions\u201d, the human consumption of \u201cmuch of thenon-renewable resources which have taken the earth 250 million years to produce\u2013all in the name ofeconomic development and human progress\u201d, the \u201ccombined impacts of rising per capita consumptioncombined with the rising human population\u201d, and the \u201cmulti-national scramble now taking placefor more fossil fuel deposits under the dissolving ice caps in the arctic regions\u201d. Alarmed by thisobsession with fossil fuels, the signatories exclaim, \u201cWe are accelerating our own destruction throughthese processes\u201d.Looking for benchmarks that might mitigate the climate crisis, they point to Earth scientists\u2019conclusion that a rise of two degrees centigrade in global temperature, which had been identified as the\u201ctipping point\u201d for climate disaster, is \u201cvery unlikely to be avoided\u201d if present activities continue. Theypoint to other leading scientists who consider 1.5 degrees centigrade to be a more likely \u201ctipping point\u201dwhich, when reached, would expose \u201ccountless other creatures to drought, hunger and flooding\u201d.They lament that the \u201cbrunt of this will continue to be borne by the poor\u201d. From their faith perspective,all countries, \u201cespecially the more developed nations,\u201d must \u201cincrease their efforts and adopt thepro-active approach needed to halt and hopefully eventually reverse the damage being wrought\u201d.To strive to reduce this predicted damage, the signatories call for action by delegates at theforthcoming COP 21, by wealthy nations and oil-producing people of all nations and their leaders, bycorporations, finance, and the business sector, by all groups, and by all Muslims. They begin by citingpertinent passages from the Qur\u2019an that motivate their call to all to take action on the climate crisis.Among the motivating principles of faith that the signatories identify are their beliefs in \u201cGod isthe Lord and Sustainer of all beings, \u201cthe One Creator\u201d, \u201cthe Maker, the Giver of Form\u201d, who \u201chasGeosciences 2016, 6, 31 13 of 19perfected every thing He has created\u201d, who \u201cencompasses all of His creation\u201d, who \u201ccreated the Earthin perfect equilibrium\u201d, and who values all creatures. The signatories move to their faith-based viewof the human role within God\u2019s creation and explain that God, out of \u201cimmense mercy\u201d has givenhumans \u201cfertile land, fresh air, clean water and all the good things on Earth that makes our liveshere viable and delightful\u201d. Though humans constitute \u201ca miniscule part of the divine order\u201d, weare \u201cexceptionally powerful beings\u201d who are responsible to God for establishing \u201cgood\u201d and averting\u201cevil\u201d and who are accountability to God for their actions. The \u201ccreation of the heavens and the earth\u201dare \u201cfar greater\u201d than humankind, most humans \u201cdo not know it\u201d. Thus, they have corrupted theearth. They need to change their destructive ways and follow the example of Prophet Muhammed who\u201c[d]eclared and protected the rights of all living beings\u201d, \u201cprohibited killing living beings for sport,guided his companions to conserve water even in washing for prayer, forbade the felling of trees in thedesert,\u201d established \u201cprotected areas (himas) for the conservation and sustainable use of rangelands,plant cover and wildlife\u201d, lived \u201ca frugal life, free of excess, waste, and ostentation\u201d, renewed and\u201crecycled his meagre possessions by repairing or giving them away\u201d, ate \u201csimple, healthy food, whichonly occasionally included meat\u201d, took \u201cdelight in the created world\u201d, and was \u201ca mercy to all beings\u201d.Evoking the Prophet\u2019s teachings and way of life has high significance for Muslims.From this faith perspective and recognition of transgressions against their faith, the signatoriesof the Islamic Declaration call upon the delegates to COP 21 of the U.N. Framework Convention onClimate Change and the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol to be held in Paris in December2015 \u201cto bring their discussions to an equitable and binding conclusion, bearing in mind\u201d the \u201cscientificconsensus on climate change, which is to stabilize greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere ata level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate systems\u201d and to set\u201cclear targets and monitoring systems\u201d, remembering the \u201cdire consequences to planet earth if we donot do so\u201d. The signatories express the \u201cenormous responsibility\u201d of the delegates at COP 21 on behalfof \u201cthe rest of humanity, including leading the rest of us to a new way of relating to God\u2019s Earth\u201d.Exhorting the other categories of people at various levels of governance to responsible action, thetasks the signatories identify appear formidable, and their moral obligations heavy. To the wealthynations and oil producing states, the signatories ask them to lead the way in \u201cphasing out theirgreenhouse gas emissions as early as possible and no later than the middle of the century\u201d; to provide\u201cgenerous financial and technical support to the less well-off to achieve a phase-out of greenhousegases as early as possible\u201d; to recognize \u201cthe moral obligation to reduce consumption so that the poormay benefit from what is left of the earth\u2019s non-renewable resources\u201d; to stay within \u201cthe \u20182 degree\u2019limit, or, preferably, within the \u20181.5 degree\u2019 limit, bearing in mind that two-thirds of the earth\u2019s provenfossil fuel reserves remain in the ground\u201d; to re-focus \u201ctheir concerns from unethical profit from theenvironment, to that of preserving it and elevating the condition of the world\u2019s poor\u201d; and, to invest inthe creation of \u201ca green economy\u201d.The signatories call \u201cpeople of all nations and their leaders to \u201cphase out greenhouse gas emissionsas soon as possible in order to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere\u201d; to commit\u201cto 100% renewable energy and/or a zero emissions strategy as early as possible, to mitigate theenvironmental impact of their activities\u201d; to invest in \u201cdecentralized renewable energy, which is thebest way to reduce poverty and achieve sustainable development\u201d; to pursue growth wisely and inmoderation, \u201cplacing a priority on increasing the resilience of all, and especially the most vulnerable,to the climate change impacts already underway and expected to continue for many years to come\u201d;to initiate \u201ca fresh model of wellbeing, based on an alternative to the current financial model whichdepletes resources, degrades the environment, and deepens inequality\u201d; and to prioritize \u201cadaptationefforts with appropriate support to the vulnerable countries with the least capacity to adapt. And tovulnerable groups, including indigenous peoples, women and children\u201d.Corporations, finance, and the business sector are called to shoulder \u201cthe consequences of theirprofit-making activities, and take a visibly more active role in reducing their carbon footprint andother forms of impact upon the natural environment\u201d; to commit themselves \u201cto 100% renewableGeosciences 2016, 6, 31 14 of 19energy and/or a zero emissions strategy as early as possible and shift investments into renewableenergy\u201d; to change \u201cfrom the current business model which is based on an unsustainable escalatingeconomy, and to adopt a circular economy that is wholly sustainable\u201d; to heed \u201cto social and ecologicalresponsibilities, particularly to the extent that they extract and utilize scarce resources\u201d; and to assist in\u201cthe divestment from the fossil fuel driven economy and the scaling up of renewable energy and otherecological alternatives\u201d.All groups are called to \u201cjoin us in collaboration, co-operation and friendly competition in thisendeavour\u201d. The signatories \u201cwelcome the significant contributions\u201d made by other religious faiths soall can be \u201cwinners in this race\u201d. They continue with hope: \u201cIf we each offer the best of our respectivetraditions, we may yet see a way through our difficulties\u201d.The signatories\u2019 final call is to \u201call Muslims wherever they may be\u201d and list \u201cheads ofstate\u201d, \u201cpolitical leaders\u201d, \u201cpeople in the business community\u201d, \u201cdelegates to the UN FrameworkConvention on Climate Change\u201d, \u201creligious leaders and scholars\u201d, \u201cmosque congregations\u201d, \u201cIslamicendowments\u201d, \u201ceducators and educational institutions\u201d, \u201ccommunity leaders\u201d, \u201ccivil society activists\u201d,\u201cnon-governmental organisations\u201d, and \u201ccommunications and media\u201d. Obviously, they are striving tobe inclusive of Muslims in all occupations. Siting a phrase from the Qur\u2019an, the signatories recalled ameaningful warning: \u201cDo not strut arrogantly on the earth. You will never split the earth apart norwill you ever rival the mountains\u2019 stature\u2019 (Qur\u2019an 17: 37)\u201d. The Islamic Declaration on Global ClimateChange closes with a teaching by the Prophet Mohammad underscoring his valuation of Earth and eachMuslim\u2019s responsibility and accountability to God for functioning appropriately: \u201cThe world is sweetand verdant, and verily Allah has made you stewards in it, and He sees how you acquit yourselves(Had\u0131\u00afth related by Muslim from Abu Sa\u2018\u0131\u00afd Al-Khudr\u0131\u00af)\u201d.This call to all Muslims could have immense ramifications for mitigating the climate crisis if theimams in mosques are committed to reminding the current two billion and rapidly increasing numberof Muslims of their moral responsibilities as taught in the Qur\u2019an and by their revered prophet [42,43].Imams and representatives of institutions of higher learning are among the signatories of the IslamicDeclaration and could be instrumental in assuring that these responsibilities are included in imamtraining. Other signatories include the Climate Action Network International based in Lebanon whichendeavors to influence Arab climate policy and raise the priority of the issue among the public andgovernments [44], the Green Mosque Initiative which encourages energy efficiency in mosques [45],the Indonesian Council of Ulema, and the Saudi Wildlife Authority. Though not a signatory of theIslamic Declaration per se, the organization known as Green Muslims is engaged in community actionand education [46]. One chapter in the United States is Wisconsin Green Muslims (formerly the IslamicEnvironmental Group of Wisconsin) that has been drawing deeply upon Islam for ten years wheneducating, acting, demonstrating, and advocating the efficient use of energy, decrease in fossil fuelreliance, and a renewable energy future [47].6. Discussion and ConclusionsJudaism represented by Rabbi Arthur Waskow, Christianity by Pope Francis of the Roman CatholicChurch and Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew of Eastern Orthodoxy, and Islam by the signatories ofthe Islamic Declaration on Global Climate Change share a basic faith in God as the Creator of the worldto whom they believe they are responsible for how they function in relation to one another and toGod\u2019s creation. Among these responsibilities are to care for and use God\u2019s creation with restraint,demonstrate concern for the poor, vulnerable, and future generations, and account to God for theiractions. While these are basic faith perspectives common to the Abrahamic religions, each religionhas unique ways of expressing its faith in worship, word, and deed. These faith-based expressionsconstitute attempts to convey why and how to live meaningfully in relation to others persons, theworld of diverse entities God made possible, and God.The subjects of this article also share a reliance on climate and other Earth sciences that studythe constituents of the world to make informed decisions about actions to take individually, byGeosciences 2016, 6, 31 15 of 19their religious communities, and in the public square. For these efforts, they need the best possibleconclusions that Earth scientists can draw from their research\u2014predictions of adverse effects froma warming planet, ranges of certainty pertaining to these predictions in the future, and methods formitigating the effects of human-forced climate change. These religious leaders and representativeorganizations also rely upon the social sciences for knowing the pros and cons of adaptation strategiesand how to implement the most effective and acceptable from their faith-based moral perspectives.In addition to the four aforementioned religious leaders and organizations, others have relied uponscientific conclusions about climate change when advocating action at various levels of governance.Anglican, Baptist, Churches of Christ, Evangelical Lutheran, Methodist, Presbyterian, Quaker, UnitedChurch of Christ, Unitarian Universalist, and the churches of Scotland and Sweden are among otherChristian denominations that have issued statements on climate change and/or advocating action atCOP 21 [48,49]. Statements have also been issued by Baha\u2019i, Buddhist, Daoist, Shinto, and other worldreligions [48].Furthermore, many of these religious communities collaborated in issuing interfaith statements.One is the Statement of Faith and Spiritual Leaders on the upcoming United Nations Climate Change Conference,COP21 that was signed by 154 religious leaders from different faith groups throughout the worldand hand delivered to Christiana Figueres, the Executive Secretary of the United Nations FrameworkConvention on Climate Change, on 20 October 2015 in Bonn when representatives of the nationswere drafting the text to be considered at COP 21 [50]. In this statement, the religious leaders urgedgovernments to cut emissions of greenhouse gases and investment in fossil-fueled energy. Another isthe Interfaith Declaration on Climate Change that had been endorsed by leaders of the world religions andaffiliated organizations who stipulated that their \u201creligious convictions and cosmological narrativestell us that this earth and the whole universe are gifts that we have received from the spring of life,from God. It is our obligation to respect, protect and sustain these gifts by all means\u201d [51].Did these religious-based efforts contribute to the positive outcome of COP 21? Were therepresentatives of nations that flocked to U.N. headquarters in New York City on 22 April 2016 to signthe Paris Agreement influenced by religious leaders and advocacy efforts by religious communities?A recent analysis of surveys conducted in the United States suggests that a charismatic religiousleader can be highly influential for decision-making on climate change. When comparing surveysconducted in Spring 2015 before Pope Francis issued Laudato Si\u2019 and Fall 2015 after the encyclicalbecame public followed by his visit to the United States, researchers at the University of Michiganand Muhlenberg College concluded that the pope and his call to action contributed to a rise in theacceptance of the vexing climate change phenomenon across religions, that 15% of the people surveyedwere more convinced climate change is occurring and should be addressed than they were in theearlier survey, that 60% support the pope\u2019s call to action on climate change but only 49% believetheir religious leaders should discuss environmental issues within the context of their faith, and thatpeople are more likely to connect their attitudes about climate change to their moral convictions, nottheir religious faith [52]. Apparently, a charismatic leader who articulates and demonstrates a moralpurpose that transcends self-interests can be influential.However, followers are essential for action on climate change at all levels of governance fromindividuals in their homes, work, and recreational activities to increasingly expansive opportunitiesfor decision-making that culminate at the international level. The representative organizations ofthe Abrahamic religious discussed above appear motivated by their leaders, equipped by their faith,informed by climate science, and engaged in addressing human-forced climate change in all facets ofhuman life. Though this article is limited to four communities selected from the Abrahamic religionsthat have issued key statements on climate change, other denominations, religions, and affiliatedgroups deserve attention [53,54].Perhaps countries throughout the world will be influenced by religious leaders and their followersto fulfill commitments they made when signing the Paris Agreement in a ceremonial setting that wasbroadcast by satellite throughout the world. Perhaps national, regional, and local governments will beGeosciences 2016, 6, 31 16 of 19influenced to facilitate energy efficiency and renewable energy in all sectors of society. Perhaps sizablenumbers of the 14 million Jews, 1.2 billion Roman Catholics, 260 million Eastern Orthodox, and 2billion Muslims in the world will respond positively and effectively to their leaders\u2019 calls to action andurgings by their respective faith-motivated organizations. Perhaps the leaders of other religions andorganizations who are addressing the climate crisis and related problems will persuade and facilitatethe response of millions of people who share their faith.Theologians and scientists have roles to play as distinct contributors to religious motivation andaction on climate change. Both research within the scope of their disciplines where they use theirrespective data and methods, realize their limitations, and recognize that each can open to the otherfor a more comprehensive understanding of issues at their boundaries [55]. While scientists continueto study the world from an empirical perspective, theologians focus on the meaning of the Earthcommunity, the human place within it, and how humans should function accordingly.As a systematic theologian and ethicist whose primary data base is the Catholic theologicaltradition that I relate constructively and meaningfully to the natural sciences and technology, I amaware of efforts by hundreds of scholars of the world religions to reflect theologically and ethically onecological concerns [56] and many who have been particularly attentive to the climate crisis [57]. Anescalation of these efforts is warranted as scientific findings point to the reality of adverse effects thatare occurring today, causing hardships especially for poor and vulnerable people, and threatening alife-impoverished Earth in the future. While remaining alert to scientific findings, scholars of the worldreligions must dig deeply into the traditions on which they focus and make promising insights knownto leaders who can teach, preach, act, and pray with members of their communities. Earth scientistswill find these religious scholars, leaders, and affiliated groups allies in the quest for a flourishingEarth\u2014our common home.Conflicts of Interest: The author declares no conflict of interest.References1.

Reviews of major accidents consistently identify the attributes of organizational management that contribute either directly or indirectly to incidents. At the individual level of safety, meta-analyses indicate that the organizational context shapes the motivation to work safely and the type of safe or unsafe behaviors that are enacted. In this chapter we present the construct of safety climate as a critically important aspect of the organizational context that influences myriad safety outcomes. Safety climate is widely defined as the \u201cshared perceptions with regard to safety policies, procedures and practices\u201d in an organization (Zohar, 2011, p. 143).  Shared perceptions about the value and meaning of safety have been shown to influence safety across a range of industries that deal with individual and environmental hazards. Substantial research has shown that safety climate improves safety outcomes in healthcare, manufacturing, mining, transport, and energy production. We explore the implications of shared perceptions of safety definition and develop and expanded view of the nature and impact of safety climate in organizations. We define safety climate in terms of a perceptual, collective and multidimensional phenomena in organizations to exercise a subjective-normative influence on individual and group behaviors through sense-making processes. Ultimately, this process influences organizational outcomes of safety as well as other aspects of organizational functioning such as productivity.  The review is divided into four main sections. The first section reviews the nature of safety climate as an entity in organisations and we outline how shared perceptions across multiple dimensions of the organisation constitute safety climate. We also review safety climate as an entity at different levels of analysis including team, organisation, industry, and 3  national levels. Second, we review how safety climate influences individual processes in terms of cognitive sense making, motivation, and behaviour. Third, we review the impact of these processes on organisation level outcomes of safety and productivity. Finally, we integrate these different areas into a dynamic system to explore how safety climate might develop and change over time. Throughout these four sections we review existing research and theory and identify practical implications for the management of safety at both an organisational and an individual level. Figure 1 outlines the content of the first three parts of the review.   Figure 1 Review structure: safety climate, individual processes, and organizational outcomes  2 Nature of safety climate  In this section we review the key features of safety climate and explore implications of the construct for managing safety in organizations. The next section reviews the features of safety climate that constitute it as a distinct organizational entity and conceptual topic in the field of OB and I/O Psychology.  4  2.1 Collective perceptions Zohar (1980, p. 101) defined safety climate as \u201cthe molar and unified set of cognitions [held by workers] regarding the safety aspects of their organization\u201d. This influential definition positioned safety climate as a specific form of organizational climate based on individuals\u2019 evaluation of their experiences of safety in the work environment. Another perspective describes safety climate is an \u201cexperientially based description of what people see and report happening in the real organizational situation\u201d (Ostroff, Kinicki, & Tamkins, 2003, p. 566). The range of perceptions that might constitute safety climate is wide (Christian, Bradley, Wallace, Burke, & Spears, 2009),  In addition,  it is important to differentiate safety climate perceptions other types of safety related constructs such as risk appraisal and attitudes toward safety (Huang, Ho, Smith, Chen, & Mith, 2006).  First, safety climate is based on shared perceptions of the context. This highlights that  climate is a collective property of groups but derived from perceptions of single individuals and differs from other individual constructs such as personal attitudes toward safety.  Safety climate perceptions are characterized by being intrinsically descriptive and cognitive in their nature with reference to observable features of organizational safety as they are experienced by employees in their daily interactions (Guldenmund, 2000; Zohar & Luria, 2005). In contrast, safety attitudes such as fatalism, personal responsibility for safety, and scepticism  can be characterized as intrinsically evaluative and affective in their nature (Mearns, Flin, Gordon, & Fleming, 1998).   Griffin and Neal (2000) identified three general domains of safety management in the organizations: general policies, formal procedure systems, and work practices relating to safety promotion in the workplace. Through experience of these aspects of the organization 5  during daily interactions, employees develop a unified perception of the priority of safety in the overall workplace (Zohar, 2008).  2.1.1 Differentiating safety climate from general climate and psychological climate Safety climate can be differentiated from the construct of general organizational climate because of the focus on the safety domain. In the broader literature of applied psychology and organizational psychology, general organizational climate refers to the shared perceptions among employees concerning the procedures, practices and kinds of behaviors that get rewarded and supported with regard to a specific strategic focus (Schneider, 1990). When the strategic focus involves performance of high-risk operations, the resultant shared perceptions define safety climate (Zohar, 1980; 2010). From this perspective, safety climate is a specific form of organizational climate, which describes individual perceptions of the value of safety in the work environment (Neal, Griffin, & Hart, 2000) The shared nature of safety climate differentiates from the notion of psychological climate (Neal & Griffin, 2004). Whereas psychological climate refers to individual perceptions of the work environment (James & James 1989), safety climate emerges only when then these perceptions are shared by individuals within a work group or organisation. More specifically, safety climate refers to the shared perceptions among members of an organization with regard to safety policies, procedures, and practices (Griffin & Neal, 2000). In other words, safety climate can be viewed as a shared and overall perception about the underlying values, beliefs, and principles that operate in relation to safety within their organization. These perceptions serve as a collective frame of reference for employees that provides cues about expected behaviour and outcome contingencies related to safety (Guldenmund, 2010; Neale & Griffin, 2006; Schneider, 1997; Zohar, 2010).  6  2.1.2 Differentiating safety climate from safety culture Safety climate is based on perceptions shared by individual in the work context. In contrast, safety culture refers to the underlying assumptions and values that guide behaviour in organizations. A key difference, therefore, is the greater accessibility of safety climate perceptions to conscious evaluation compared to the more implicit processes of safety culture. In this way, safety climate might be regarded as the surface features of the safety culture discerned from the workforce's attitudes and perceptions at a given point in time (Flin, Mearns, O'Connor & Bryden, 2000). Safety climate measures provide a snapshot of the state of safety providing an indicator of the underlying safety culture of a work group, plant or organisation. Despite these conceptual differences, much research and practice conflates the meaning of the two constructs. For example, numerous studies of safety culture use survey instruments that are more accurately defined as measures of safety climate. There are some advantages to developing a fine-grained distinction between climate and culture in specific domains (Day, Griffin, & Louw, 2014). However, both constructs emphasize the way safety is valued in the organization and explore the processes through which the meaning attached to safety influences safety outcomes in the organization. Therefore, our review focuses on safety climate as defined above. We emphasize that much of the research in safety culture overlaps with safety culture research and shares substantially similar goals.  2.2  Multifaceted features of safety climate A major conceptual challenge for safety climate research has been convergence in the definition of its constituent elements (Christian, Bradley, Wallace, Burke, & Spears, 2009; Clarke, 2006; 2010; Neal & Griffin, 2004; Zohar, 2010). This diversity of dimensions reflects the second aspect of our definitions which describes safety climate as multifaceted because it is multidimensional and applies across multiple levels of analysis. In this section we review 7  the scope of this diversity in two ways. First, we review the various dimensions of safety climate that have been proposed. We then review the application of safety across multiple levels of analysis. 2.2.1 The multidimensional nature of safety climate Since (Zohar, 1980) was published 35 years ago, both theory and research have advanced, but a comprehensive theory and a unanimously preferred measurement approach to safety climate are still lacking (Guldenmund, 2000; Wu, Liu, & Lu, 2007; Zohar, 2010).  Much of the subsequent scientific research on safety climate has focused on assessing empirical models rather than developing theoretical frameworks. Empirical issues include assessing the dimensionality of safety climate including the factorial structure of measurement scales and their predictive validity with regard to a variety of safety outcomes (Clarke, 2006). Previous literature reviews have identified more than fifty different variables or conceptual themes that have been included in safety climate questionnaires (Flin et al., 2000; Guldenmund, 2000).  An meta-analysis by Clarke (2006) examining twenty-two empirical studies showed at least three trends in safety climate research reflecting the conceptual confusion between perceptual and attitudinal approaches to safety research (Guldenmund, 2000), resulting in a variety of mixed models that conflated perceptions and attitudes. In addition, various studies also included constructs such as dispositions, beliefs, risk-perceptions, work stressors as elements of safety climate. As a consequence of this lack of conceptual clarity, it was difficult to ascertain a clear link between safety climate and safety outcomes. Aggregation across psychological constructs and overlap between safety and non-safety variables meant that key relationships were diluted (Wallance, Popp, & Mandore, 2006). Clarke\u2019s meta-analysis (2006) showed that more clearly defined perceptual approaches safety climate tended to report stronger predictive power for outcomes such as occupational accidents. 8  Despite the diversity of dimensions described in literature, the various definitions and measures show some commonality that suggest core conceptual themes (Flin et al., 2000, Guldenmund, 2000). Key themes that have been identified include the perceptions of managerial commitment for safety, safety systems and procedures, and training and competence systems related to working safely.  Adopting a perceptual approach to the study of organizational climate, Neal, Griffin and Hart (2000) discussed and empirically tested a multidimensional model of  safety climate focusing on a limited set of organizational dimensions when conceptualizing and measuring organizational safety climate across different industrial sectors (Neal, Griffin, & Hart, 2000). These include management values (i.e., the extent to which management places a high priority on safety), safety communication (i.e., the extent to which there is an open exchange of information regarding safety), safety training (i.e., the extent to which training is accessible, relevant, and comprehensive), and safety systems (i.e., the extent to which safety procedures are perceived to be effective in preventing accidents). 2.2.1.1 Relative priority The following scientific debate on safety climate\u2019s attributes has driven researchers to further specify this construct in relation to the broader and more complex organizational environment in term of relative priority. In this second perspective, safety climate reflects the shared perceptions that have employees of the relative importance granted to safety issues in their organization (Zohar, 2000). These perceptions serve as a frame of reference and provide psychological guidance for choosing adaptive and appropriate workplace behaviors (Neal & Griffin, 2004). However, at any development stage of the life of a company, this shared perception of safety values and priorities in the workplace might be affected by both internal characteristics of the organizations (i.e. department policies; supervision; team-working 9  processes) (Zohar & Luria, 2005; 2010), and by exogenous features related to the external environment (i.e. industrial regulations; national cultures) (Mearns & Yule, 2009).  Overall, these reflections have lead scholars and researchers to a more complex and detailed analysis of safety climate in term of multilevel construct and phenomenon of contemporaneous organizations (Zohar, 2014; 2010).    2.2.2 The multilevel nature of safety climate Safety climate is a collective construct that has been applied to a variety of aggregate structures. This section reviews different levels of analysis at which safety climate might operate. The level of conceptualization and analysis of safety climate is a continuing debate among climate researchers as climate can be investigated at different levels of the organization (Kozlowski & Klein, 2000; Rousseau, 1985). Psychological safety climate reflects individual perceptions of safety policies, procedures, and practices in the workplace (Christian et al., 2009). These non-aggregated perceptions of the work environment (Clarke, 2010) differ from safety climate at the group or organizational level, which represent collective perceptions of workplace safety. Although safety climate has traditionally been conceptualized and operationalized at the organizational level (e.g. Zohar, 1980), there is growing evidence for the informative and predictive nature of safety climate at various levels of aggregation.  Safety climate has most commonly been viewed as an organizational level construct. A number of studies explore safety climate as a team or group-level construct. However, even when safety climate is studied empirically at the group level, the theorizing around the nature of climate is often oriented toward the organizational level.  Below we explore implications of safety climate at the national and industry level of analysis. These two levels are considered less frequently in the literature but raise increasingly important issues for organizations operating in hazardous environments. We 10  consider the issue of national culture at some length because this is an important are for future development. 2.2.2.1 Industry level As noted by Zohar (2014), there have been two primary approaches to the measurement of safety climate. A first approach has favoured the development of universal or general measures of organizational safety climate for use regardless of the specific organizational context (e.g., Neal et al., 2000; Griffin & Neal, 2000). A second approach has been to develop industry - and sometimes organization-specific measures of safety climate adapted to the unique features of the industrial context (Dedobbeleer & Beland, 1991; Singer, Meterko, Baker, Gaba, Falwell, & Rosen, 2007). While the former approach necessitates the development and validation of climate measures in each new context, the latter offers the possibility of accruing knowledge regarding the antecedents and consequences of safety climate across multiple contexts, languages, and cultures (Mearns, Whitaker, & Flin, 2001). In order to do so, however, there must first be ample evidence that the meaning and measurement of safety climate is equivalent across these disparate contexts (Zohar, 2014).  Concepts, methods, and tools to better manage risk and safety are sorely needed. This point appears to be absolutely salient for future research avenues on safety climate, in response to the continuing array of catastrophes in high-risk industries, such as oil and gas, nuclear power generation, aviation, railways, medicine (Grote, 2007). Over the years various industries have led the way to improved safety management, with other industries following them, but often also reinventing practices that were well established elsewhere or adopting practices that did not fit their new context (Mearns & Yule, 2009).  In the light of these reflections, it appears relevant that further research will discuss both effective ways to foster our knowledge of generalizability of safety climate models with a cross-industry approach on opportunities and limits of generalizing concepts and methods 11  in the investigation of safety climate phenomena. Aspects such as the coexistence of different professional sub-cultures in risk management, department interactions, investigation systems, socio-technically based risk assessment, and organizational and regulatory structures are all aspects whose effects may vary in a significant way across different industries (Grote, 2007). Therefore, further research on safety climate needs to address how the interplay between industry-specific features, managerial orientations and operational safety systems by organizations might univocally interact to eventually determine the way in which safety climate develops over time (Zohar, 2014). 2.2.2.2 National culture Cultural differences in perceptions of risk as well as broad social and economic conditions provide a basis for exploring national differences in safety culture. Considering the features of the contemporary economy, the management of organizational safety in international and culturally diverse organizations is a concern for many high-risk industries (Reader, Noort, Shorrock, & Kirwan, 2015). Although there is evidence that safety climate may generalize across organisations (e.g., Mearns et al., 2001), and industries (e.g., Hahn & Murphy, 2008), there has been limited attention given to generalization across national cultures (Zohar, 2014). Most published studies have been conducted western countries and especially in Anglo English-speaking countries such the US, UK, Australia, and Canada (Barbaranelli, Petitta, & Probst, 2015). Notable exceptions such the study by Bahari and Clarke (2013) also highlight the limited information about safety climate in different national context. Therefore, comparative studies are certainly needed to understand how well established the meanings of safety climate might transfer to different national and cultural contexts (Zohar, 2014).  However, beyond the question of internal validity in different national and cultural contexts (Hsu, Lee, Wu, & Takano, 2008), there is a more urgent need to understand how 12  well the assumptions and measures safety climate apply across global organisations. This is particularly true if we consider that - at a broader level - recent reviews of the link between national cultures and organizational safety suggest that there are few consistent predictors of risk taking behaviour and safety performance across cultures (Mearns & Yule, 2009). As argued by Reader and collaborators (2015), there are at least three distinct macro-factors that highlight a need for researchers and practitioners to further investigate and understand safety climate from a more global vision First, the number and reach multi-national corporations in the current economy means that many large organisations have operations that span multiple countries and continents, including both highly industrialized and developing countries (Mearns & Yule, 2009). The need to understand personal and process safety from a global perspective is therefore increasingly important. For example, cross-national differences might be especially salient for organisations who appoint managers from western backgrounds to positions in non-western environments. Implications for well-established safety climate dimensions like safety managerial commitment and safety leadership (Flin et al., 2000; Griffin & Talati, 2014) across varied multinational contexts are not well understood. In addition, Mearns and Yule (2009) suggested that relationships between perceived management commitment to safety and compliance versus risk taking behaviours might vary across cultures. Future research undertaken should investigate whether differences in cultural values between the workforce and management has an impact on how safety management and supervision behaviours are construed and their influence employee safety performance in high-hazard domains.  Second, national cultures can vary greatly in their support for legislation and regulation systems that preserve, maintain and improve safety in work and organizational setting. Existing research indicates that variations in national safety regulation practices have an impact safety outcomes (Mearns & Yule, 2009). Differences in regulation can be reflected 13  in job stability, access to safety training, and the nature of safety procedures (Vincent, 2011). For example, globalized industries and organizations operate across different regulatory environments, and must manage different standards for managing and learning from risk (Colakoglu, Lepak, & Hong, 2006). A single organization can be required to work to different safety standards depending on the location of operations, which potentially creates confusion and uncertainty around practices such as safety inspections (Harzing, 2006). Third, safety-critical work is often performed by multicultural and co-located teams (Manzey & Marold, 2009). Although this diversity can be positive by bringing together different perspectives on safety (Reader et al., 2015), it also presents a challenge for safety management (Kouabenan, 2009). Different cultural values, beliefs and social representations (Cavazza & Serpe, 2009) about the way individuals contribute to safety may also strongly affect the influence of safety climate on more discretional forms of safety behaviors. For example, structured forms of workforce participation and involvement in safety management systems might be more easily accepted and used within a low power distance culture (low hierarchy and equal power distribution), but be perceived as less appropriate in a high power distance culture (strong hierarchy and unequal power distribution) (Hofstede, 1983). Moreover, some national cultural traits (e.g., for challenging authority) might influence safety-related beliefs of team members (e.g., on the acceptability of highlighting a supervisor\u2019s mistake; giving and receiving feedback and support for safety), and generally coordination on safety activities may not be optimal (e.g., expectations and behaviors for speaking up and/or supporting other\u2019s safety) (Reader et al., 2015).  Overall, a stronger focus on the cross-cultural implications of safety climate will help to understand how key elements such as managerial safety commitment might vary across national contexts. It will also provide insights into the way national systems such as 14  legislations frameworks and cultural systems such as values might moderate the link between safety climate and outcomes.  3 Individual processes We next consider the individual processes through which safety climate influences safety outcomes. Our definition indicates that safety climate exerts a subjective-normative influence on individual and group behaviour through sense-making and motivational mechanisms (Zohar, 2010). In other words, employees perceive and interpret the organization context and act according to their interpretations (Campbell, Dunnette, Lawler, & Weick, 1970; Carr, Schmidt, Ford, & DeShon, 2003). We first situate safety climate in relation to sensemaking then review various theoretical perspective applied to safety motivation. We conclude with a review of the many forms of motivated safety behaviors that contribute to overall safety. 3.1 Sensemaking Sensemaking processes help to explains how safety climate is formed over time as a collective phenomenon that goes beyond the mere individual perception of organizational values and priorities (Gonzalez-Roma, Peiro, & Tordera, 2002; Zohar, 2010).  In general, organizational sense-making, refers to ongoing interpretative processes in which individuals who are facing complex and ambiguous work situations engage in social interactions to better understand their environment and reduce uncertainty related to organizational goals, norms, and priorities (Louis, 1980; Weick, 1995). Through repeated social interactions, individuals infer organizational priorities and the corresponding behaviours to be rewarded or sanctioned. Sense-making is a primary means through which organizational events and social information are transformed into a collective experience organizational or team climates (Ostroff et al., 2003). 15  Through sense-making mechanisms, safety climate provides a shared interpretation framework which affects motivations and behaviors by individuals (Beus, Jarrett, Bergman, Mindy, & Payne, 2012). This process is important for safety were interactions are embedded in a complex net of competing organizational goals (speed/productivity vs. safety), time frames, (short vs. long-term goals), and contradictory messages (enacted vs declared policies) (Zohar, 2002; 2003).  For instance, strong tendencies for short-term maximization of productive instances (melioration bias) results in on-going dilemma for managers and supervisors, which might lead employees to cope with a multitude of actual policies and practices, often inconsistent with the declared ones (Zohar, 2008). From this perspective, managers and supervisor\u2019s daily actions and informal interactions provide the most reliable information concerning utilities and priorities at the workplace (Luria, Zohar, & Erev, 2008) which will constitute the basic elements of safety climate through the construction of a shared framework to use as reference to assure safety instances balancing different goals (Griffin & Talati, 2014). For example, Luria and Rafaeli (2008) showed that colleagues from the same team unit may work as analogous sense-making referent in forming group consensus (Zohar & Luria, 2005), complementing supervisors\u2019 functions in  creating a common perception of safety climate in a collective process of making sense of the environment, across different situation and circumstances. 3.2 Motivation Internal psychological states are typically proposed as precursors to effort and behavior (Griffin & Neal, 2000).  Understanding what motivates employees to work safely is a crucial for tackling unsafe behavior and increasing employees\u2019 participation in safety activities at work (Conchie, 2013). Safety motivation reflects \u201can individual\u2019s willingness to exert effort to enact safety behaviors and the valence associated with those behaviors\u201d (Neal & Griffin, 2006, p. 947). As a psychological process that directs, energizes and sustains 16  action (Latham & Pinder, 2005; Scott et al., 2014), safety motivation has been conceptualized to determine safe behavior in the workplace across a different range of industrial and organizational contexts (e.g., Clarke; 2010; Griffin & Neal, 2000; Neal & Griffin, 2004).  Griffin and Neal (2000) proposed that safety motivation is proximal determinant of employee safety behaviors and  that distal factors such as safety climate have an indirect effect on safety behaviors by influencing employees\u2019 safety motivation. Subsequent research has consistently supported these conceptual assumptions (Christian et al., 2009; Clarke, 2010; 2006; Neal & Griffin, 2006). However, a variety of theoretical perspectives underpin the concept of motivation in safety research (Scott, Fleming, & Kelloway, 2014). Below we review the theoretical foundations and empirical bases for different approaches to motivation as an outcome of safety climate and a determinant of safety behavior.  3.2.1 Safety motivation and normative influence by safety climate   The subjective meaning of safety is commonly identified to underlie safety motivation (Conchie, 2013; Curcuruto, Guglielmi, & Mariani, 2013; Scott et al., 2014).  As noted by Zohar (2010), maintaining high levels of safety motivation presents a paradox to practitioners and researchers alike because, contrary to the assumption that self-preservation overrides other motives (Maslow, 1970), careless behavior prevails during many routine jobs. There is a consensus among scholars that safety climate affects worker motivation through normative influence mechanisms (Tesluk & Quigley, 2004; Zohar, 2010). As a shared perception of factual managerial priorities in the organization (Griffin & Neal, 2000), safety climate informs the workforce about the normative value of safety in relation to other aspects of the organization (Cavazza & Serpe, 2009). A positive and consistent organizational safety climate reinforces expectancy-value perceptions of safe (Parker, Bindl & Strauss, 2010; Vroom, 1964). Individuals enact safety behaviors which are perceived to be rewarded and valued in the organization (Zohar, 2010). 17  3.2.2 Safety motivation and self-determination perspectives  In recent years, an expanded view of safety motivation has been developed through the principles of self-determination theory (SDT) (Scott et al., 2014). This theory builds on the distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic types of motivation at work (Deci & Ryan, 2002). According to SDT, extrinsic motivation explains work behavior in terms of its expected instrumental value for obtaining tangible rewards or avoiding undesired outcomes (Gagn\u0117 & Deci, 2005). In contrast, intrinsic motivation involves engaging in a work behavior because it is personally rewarding; performing an activity for its own sake rather than the desire for some external reward. In safety climate research, it can be argued that because the target of climate perceptions concerns rewarded role behavior, it follows that the main safety climate-behavior relationship should be explained in terms of motivation for safety externally directed (Zohar, Huang, Lee, & Robertson, 2015). However, the distinction between the two types of motivations adds further complexity to this argument. Many safety events (e.g., near-misses or accidents) are low-likelihood with delayed and unsure negative outcomes. Individuals might choose an unsafe behavior such as working faster if the subjective expected utility of unsafe behavior exceeds that of safe behavior, resulting in greater extrinsic motivation for engaging in safety shortcuts or workarounds (Zohar & Erev, 2007). Safety climate, as a contextual variable indicative of the extent to which employees expect safety behavior to result in short-term and more probable positive outcomes (e.g. supervisory recognition and/or approval), constitutes, therefore, a key antecedent for extrinsic safety motivation. Under high safety climate, the level of such motivation can be expected to exceed that associated with safety\u2019s competing demands, surpassing the effects of socio-cognitive behavioral bias accountable for the underweight of the benefits associable with safe conducts in the workplace (i.e. recency bias; melioration bias) (Zohar & Erev, 2007). 18  On the other hand, SDT suggests the increasing internalization of externally-regulated behavior. Therefore it might be argued that safety climate endangers identification - or integration-based extrinsic motivation (Zohar et al., 2015; Ryan & Deci, 2000). A further consideration is that many safety behaviors involve rule compliance, offering limited potential for autonomy or interest (Parker, Axtell, & Turner, 2001). We discuss the motivational implications of different forms of safety behavior in more detail below. 3.2.3 Safety motivation and psychological empowerment Safety climate might also motivate safety behavior through feelings of empowerment, psychological ownership, personal engagement and passion for meeting challenging work goals (Curcuruto & Griffin, in press; Parker, Turner, & Griffin, 2003; Zohar, 2008). For example, highly engaged employees experience a sense of personal significance and pride (Schaufeli, Bakker, & Salanova, 2006). A recent literature review concluded that because engaged employees find their work psychologically meaningful and self-relevant (Spreitzer, 1995; 1996), they feel as though work objectives or processes have become part of, or are an extension of, themselves (Pierce, Kostova, & Dirks, 2003). Consequently, they are more intrinsically motivated to protect their work from harm as an expression of the intrinsic tendency for self-protective behavior (Greenglass, 2002). In other words, when work becomes a psychologically meaningful activity, turning into an extension of one\u2019s self, safety behavior becomes an intrinsically motivated investment in self-protective behavior when performing high-risk jobs (Zohar, Huang, Lee, & Robertson, 2014).  Given this line of argument, it follows that work environments whose contextual attributes have been shown to promote employee engagement in conjunction with exposure to routine physical risks can offer an opportunity to stimulate intrinsic motivation on safety behavior. Literature reviews of job design (Parker, 2014) have identified a number of work-related attributes promoting such engagement (Macey & Schneider, 2008; Simpson, 2009). 19  These attributes include task autonomy, challenge and variety (Gagne & Deci, 2005), task meaningfulness (Kahn, 1990), job control (Parker, William, & Turner, 2006) and employee empowerment (Carless, 2004).  3.2.4 Safety motivation and social-exchange theories  Another complementary approach linking safety climate to safety motivation involves social-exchange theory and social reciprocation principles (Mearns & Reader, 2008). Social exchange theory (Blau, 1960) proposes that when individuals (or other social agents like organizations) provide valued services, others typically respond with a certain level of obligation in response to and exchange for these services. The social exchange perspective (Eisenberger, Fasolo, P., & Davis-LaMastro, 1990) suggests the perception of employer support and investment generates an implied obligation in employees that results in positive reciprocity favoring the organization (Dejoy, 2005). Thus, when organizations provide services which are perceived as discretionary, this could inspire reciprocating behavior in the form of employee compliance with organizational policies, rules and expectations. A strong positive safety climate, in which employees perceive that safety is prioritized and that managers are committed to their safety is likely to increase employees\u2019 feelings of commitment and satisfaction with the organization, and so influence their behavior \u2013 an effect that has been described as a \u2018positive spillover\u2019 (Morrow & Crum, 1998, p. 130). Similarly, Hofmann and Morgeson (1999) argued that individuals who perceive that their organizations are supportive of their health and safety, may feel obligated to reciprocate these attentions with higher involvement in safety behaviors (Parker et al., 2001). Therefore, perceptions of managerial commitment and organizational investment in programs promoting health and safety of the workforce might be reciprocated by employees through an active personal commitment toward compliance with organizational safety rules and procedures and 20  participation in discretional programs supporting safety in the organization (Clarke, 2010; Mearn, Hope, Ford, & Tetrick, 2010).  Similarly, other authors have extended this focus of social-exchange mechanism including the influence of organizational support for safety by supervisors, co-worker and management and their impacts on individual engagement toward safety in terms of social reciprocity (Tucker, Chmiel, Turner, Hershcovis, & Stride, 2008). In other words, various social agents such as managers, supervisors, and colleagues, become the expression of the general support and care by the organization for the quality and well-being of the work experience (Brondino, De Silva & Pasini, 2012). For example, studies have highlighted how supportive and participative managerial styles in organizations and workgroups are linked to a greater safety commitment by employees (Curcuruto et al., 2013; DeJoy, Lindsay, Vandenbergh, & Wilson, 2010; Tucker at al., 2008). 3.3 Safety behaviors We next review the link between safety climate and specific safety behaviors such as compliance and proactivity. Injury and near miss outcomes will be reviewed here at the individual level.Employee safety behaviors play an important role in maintaining a safe work environment and have been previously shown to be associated with workplace injuries (Clarke, 2006; Christian et al., 2009; Neal & Griffin, 2006).  Safety behaviors by individuals are frequently conceptualized as criteria of the overall safety performance by organizations, as they provide researchers with a measurable outcome, which is more proximally related to psychological factors than accidents or injuries (Christian et al., 2009). Moreover, safety performance behaviors tend to be predicted with greater accuracy than more distal outcomes, which often have a low base rate and skewed distributions (cf. Zohar, 2000; 2002). Similar to job performance in general, safety performance behaviors can be scaled by the frequency with which employees engage in the 21  behaviors and are distinguishable in terms of their antecedents and covariation with safety outcomes (Burke, Sarpy, Tesluk, & Smith-Crowe, 2002). Moreover, a recent meta-analysis by Clarke (2013) containing 32 adult-aged working samples revealed that higher levels of safety behavior is associated with fewer occupational injuries (average rs with occupational injuries =\u2212.21, both with N = 229 reliability-corrected meta-analytic correlations). 3.3.1 The distinction between compliance and participation Several conceptual models of safety behavior have been advanced. A first model of safety performance outlined by Burke, Sarpy, Tesluck and Smith-Crowe (2002) - defined as \u201cactions or behaviors that individuals exhibit in almost all jobs to promote the health and safety of workers, clients, the public, and the environment\u201d (p. 432) - includes four factors: (a) using personal protective equipment, (b) engaging in work practice to reduce risk, (c) communication of hazards and accidents, and (d) exercising employee rights and responsibilities. However, since the beginning of 2000\u2019s,  a more refined conceptual distinction  emerged in safety climate literature,  between safety \u201ccompliance\u201d and safety \u201cparticipation,\u201d with the former referring to \u201cgenerally mandated\u201d safety behaviors and the latter referring to safety behaviors that are \u201cfrequently voluntary\u201d (Neal et al., 2000, p. 101). This distinction is similar to that between task and contextual performance in the job performance literature (e.g., Borman & Motowidlo, 1993). From this perspective, safety compliance behaviors are the core of safety activities that are required by the formal work procedures in order to maintain a minimum level of safety (Griffin & Neal, 2000; Neal & Griffin, 2002). Examples of safety compliance behaviors include following safety rules and procedures, and complying with occupational safety regulations. Alternatively, safety participation describes behaviors that might not directly contribute to an individual\u2019s personal safety but that do help to develop an environment that supports safety (Neal & Griffin, 2006, p. 947). These behaviors include activities such as participating in voluntary safety activities, 22  helping coworkers with safety-related issues, and attending safety meetings (Neal & Griffin, 2002). 3.3.2 The distinction between affiliation and proactivity In safety literature, the concept of safety participation is also frequently used interchangeably with the notion of organizational safety citizenship (Conchie, 2013; Zohar et al., 2015) which includes a broad range of extra-role behaviors, including affiliative oriented citizenship, like helping and stewardship behaviors (Curcuruto, Mariani, Conchie, & Violante, in press), civic virtue acts (i.e. keeping informed about safety issues) (Hofmann, Morgeson, & Gerras, 2003), active caring for safety (i.e. housekeeping; risk reporting; whistleblowing actions) (Geller, Roberts, & Gilmore, 1996), and change-oriented citizenship (or safety proactivity), like safety initiative (i.e. initiating safety-related changes) (Hofmann et al., 2003; Simard & Marchand, 1995) and safety voice (i.e. raising safety related concerns; providing suggestions for improvement) (Curcuruto, Guglielmi, & Mariani, 2014, in press; Tucker et al., 2008).  4 Organizational outcomes In addition to the numerous studies devoted to the measurement of safety climate and identifying its components, a significant amount of research has focused on the nomological consequences of safety climate, with a strong focus on safety performance and safety outcomes.  In the next subsections, we will briefly review the most relevant studies that link safety climate to individual and aggregate outcomes. We will start to overview individual processes; then we will examine aggregate organizational outcomes.  4.1.1 Predictive validity issues  Recent meta-analytical studies show that safety climate offers robust prediction of objective and subjective safety criteria across industries and countries (Nahrgang, Morgeson, & Hofmann, 2011; Christian et al., 2009). The meta-analysis, based on a sample of 202 23  published studies that passed the authors\u2019 inclusion criteria, encompassing 236 independent samples (N=127,266), attests also that time has come to re-focus our attention on theoretical and conceptual issues, having demonstrated the predictive validity of safety climate as a leading safety indicator 4.1.2 The relationship between safety climate, behaviors and outcomes  Research consistently concludes that employees who report higher perceptions of safety climate also report higher engaging in more safety compliance and participation behaviors, which in turn are associated with a reduction of negative safety outcomes, like injuries and accidents (Christian et al., 2009; Neal & Griffin, 2006; Neal et al., 2000; Sinclair, Martin, & Sears, 2010; Vinodkumar & Bhasi, 2010; Zohar, 2002).   As general tendency, meta-analyses show that safety climate is more strongly associated with discretional safety behaviors like safety participation rather than compliance, even if traditionally, most of research on safety climate outcomes has been focused individual safety compliance (Christian et al., 2009; Wallace & Chen, 2006). In line with this focus, considerable empiric evidence has showed that greater individual safety compliance is associated with fewer adverse events, accidents and injuries (Zohar, 2002; Nahrgang et al., 2011).  These findings show that safety compliance is clearly essential for accident and injury prevention. Nevertheless, more recently scholars have identified broader safety behaviors beyond compliance that are increasingly important to prevent accident s and injuries in an organizational context. For instance, different clusters of safety citizenship behaviors can influence safety outcomes in a complementary way (Curcuruto et al., in press): whereas affiliative safety citizenship was found associated with minor incident events like property damages and micro-injuries (Zohar, 2002), challenging (or proactive) safety citizenship were found positively related with near-miss reporting and negatively with LTI (lost time injuries 24  entailing days of absence from work) (Kongsvik, Fenstad, & Wendelborg, 2012). The authors conclude that further research should address in which condition distinct forms of safety participation or citizenship may play a complementary role to safety compliance in improving the overall safety performance by organizations, and eventually, reducing the occurrence of negative outcomes for both people and companies.  4.1.3 Safety indicators As mentioned in the previous section on safety behaviors, safety climate research has been hampered by the lack of objective criterion data (Christian et al., 2009; Neal & Griffin, 2006; Zohar, 2000). Given the difficulties of obtaining objective data, past studies have often used either self-reports of behavioral safety (DeJoy, 2005; Thompson, Hilton, & Witt, 1998), self-report of accident occurrences (Hofmann & Stetzer, 1996), experts' ratings of safety level (Zohar, 1980), or retrospective accident data (Brown & Holmes, 1986).  To address these difficulties, many studies have recognized the concept of micro-accidents as a well-established outcome criterion of safety climate (Turner, Tucker & Kelloway, 2015; Zohar, 2000; 2002). Micro-accidents refer to on-the-job behavior-dependent minor injuries requiring medical attention. However, contrary to ordinary accidents, they do not incur any lost work days. A separate term is used to denote the marked differences in terms of underlying distributions of the two injury categories. Microaccidents have three methodological advantages as a criterion of behavioral safety (Zohar, 2000): (a) They occur much more frequently than lost-workday accidents, resulting in a homogeneous distribution as a function of time, as opposed to the highly skewed distribution characteristic of accident data in a single organization; (b) they provide an objective measure of behavioral safety unaffected by sources of bias associated with self-report or other forms of rating; and (c) they are strongly associated with lost-days accidents. 25  Near-miss is another kind of indicator used in safety climate research which is based on the analysis of potential incidents (Kongsvik et al., 2012). In the most used taxonomy systems, a near miss is considered to be an unplanned event that did not result in injury, illness, or damage \u2013 but had the potential to do so (Curcuruto et al., in press). Only a fortunate break in the chain of events prevented an injury, fatality or damage; in other words, a miss that was nonetheless very near. However, near-miss reporting is usually considered a cue for proactive management of safety in organizations, rather than a reactive lagging indicator of safety performance, like property damages and micro-injuries (Reason, 1997; 2008). Achieving a high number of near misses is the goal as long as that number is within the organization's ability to respond and investigate. Thus, many opportunities to prevent the accidents that the organization has not yet had are lost. Recognizing and reporting near miss incidents can make a major difference to the safety of workers within organizations (Kongsvik et al., 2012), and provides immense opportunity for employees\u2019 safety participation (Griffin & Neal, 2000),  Accident reporting is another relevant phenomenon associate to safety climate.  However, empiric studies showed the relationship between safety climate and critical events for organizational safety might be so linear. Research indicates that these may be substantial underestimates of the true prevalence of accidents and injuries (Probst, Brubaker, & Barsotti, 2008). A recent multilevel study conducted with a public transit employees indicated that variables such as safety\u2013production conflict and high-productivity climate are negatively related to accident-reporting attitudes (Jiang & Probst, 2015). As expected, among employees in workgroups exhibiting a positive safety climate, this negative effect was attenuated.  Researchers found also significant cross-level interactions. Using hierarchical linear modeling and survey data collected from 1,238 employees in 33 organizations, Probst (2015) 26  recently investigated the effects by employee-level supervisor safety enforcement behaviors and organizational-level safety climate on employee accident underreporting. Once again, findings showed that negative effects of supervisor enforcement on underreporting were attenuated in organizations with a positive safety climate (Probst, 2015). These findings seem to suggest prudence in addressing the causal link between safety climate and safety outcomes, without considering the interaction of safety climate with other types of contextual variables related both to risk and safety management and other typologies of organizational climate.  From a practical perspective, these findings may benefit human resources and safety professionals by pinpointing methods for increasing the accuracy of accident reporting through interventions aimed to improve safety climate at team and organizational levels , reducing actual safety incidents, and reducing the costs to individuals and organizations that result from underreporting. 4.1.4 Organizational performance Ongoing changes in economic, social, and environmental conditions also require change, adaptation and innovation in hazardous industries which have theoretical implication for existing safety climate models (Griffin, Cordery, & Soo, 2015). Rapid changes in technology and global markets, together with increasing social and environmental risks, create new levels of uncertainty and complexity. In addition, advances in safety over recent decades seem to be reaching a plateau. The rate of fatalities at work has declined but remains too high, and major accidents continue to have enormous impact on people, business, and the environment (Probst, 2015). Although safety has improved over recent decades, catastrophic accidents continue to occur and the number of workplace fatalities remains unacceptably high (SWA, 2014). Improvements in safety statistics appear to be slowing, with declines in some indicators (DNRM, 2014). Without a new integrating approach, it will be more difficult to achieve more positive outcomes from safety investments. Currently, we know surprisingly 27  little about the long-term benefit of safe work systems for industry, the community, and the economy. Although cost-benefit analyses demonstrate that safer systems provide long-term savings (e.g., lower insurance premiums), there is almost no systematic information or evaluation of the way safer systems generate productivity and innovation. In short, safety climate and safe organizational systems are valued for their \u201cpreventive\u201d role more than their \u201cgenerative\u201d contribution to change and growth (Griffin et al., 2015). A preventive focus in safety climate research is clearly important. Substantial advances have been achieved to reduce the negative consequences of poor safety. However, the benefits of preventive methods seem to be approaching a limit. In the face of pervasive change, organisations must respond adaptively and embed novel and proactive safety solutions in ongoing operations.  An increasing attention on this kind of adaptive changes has been identified in approaches such as resilience engineering (Hollnagel, Paris, Woods, & Wreathall, 2012) and high reliability organisations (HROs) (Weick & Suitcliffe, 2007). These paradigms focus their attention on how successful organizations maintain reliability while adapting to unexpected change and unplanned events (e.g., Roberts, 1990).  Usually, distinct types of change are reflected in the response to major disaster compared to the continuous improvement of HROs described above. First, disasters and other major events generate efforts for fundamental and far-reaching change to achieve optimal levels of safety and reliability. By their nature, these changes are typically reactive. In contrast, changes to highly reliable systems involve more proactive and forward looking changes that tend to be more incremental in nature (Griffin et al., 2015). The susceptibility of reliable operations to external disruption have generated efforts to create more adaptive capabilities through which organizations continually adapt to changing conditions in the external context. Both types of change have been the motivation for substantial improvements in safety operations for hazardous industries.  28  The idea of existing dynamics of safety proactivity and innovation is not new in safety climate literature (Zohar & Luria, 2005), considering organizational functions of safety related to continuous improvement and learning (Curcuruto & Griffin, in press).  However, there is currently no conceptual framework for describing qualitatively different drivers and kinds of change in safety systems (Zohar, 2008). Without an adequate framework, important aspects of innovation and changes safety related might not be effectively integrated with existing safety climate models. Moreover, it has been recently argued that the process of proactively changing core safety systems is not well articulated in current approaches to safety management (Griffin, Hodkiewicz, Dunster, Kanse, Parkes, Finnerty, Cordery, & Unsworth, 2014).  In this perspective, a possible avenue for future research aimed to cover the gap between safety climate and innovation dynamics by organizations might be offered by the concept of \u201cdynamic safety capability\u201d to explain the nature of this capability and the nature of organizational change that is involved. This concept has been defined as an organization\u2019s capacity to generate, reconfigure and adapt operational routines to sustain high levels of safety performance in environments characterized by change and uncertainty (Griffin et al., 2015). Although safety capability and climate constructs have different theoretical heritages, they still present similarities to identify ways capability and climate function to enable the development. Both the paradigms are linked to a managerial orientations by organizations which are strong determinants of both safety and innovation in organizations (Grote, 2007; H\u00fclsheger, Anderson, & Salgado, 2009; Nahrgang et al., 2011). In this perspective dynamic capability paradigms might help to extend the application of safety culture because it focuses on the capacity to create change in the future. However, the practical imperative to improve organizational safety can lead to a focus on cultural an managerial deficiencies in an organization. Research in the area of safety climate often focuses on methodological issues 29  such as dimensionality, agreement, and aggregation. The focus on assessment can also lead to emphasis on improving a poor safety climate (Health and Safety Executive, 2005) rather than preparing positive climate for future change. Conversely, there is growing evidence that a deep safety capability ensures that organisations can adapt, innovate, and perform at the highest level. Consequently, future research on safety capability might help to improve our knowledge about how safety climate might work as generative driver for innovation and productivity. Both safety and innovation are important sources of productivity improvement and the ability to adapt to change is a defining feature of modern organisations, particularly high risk environments industries 5 Future directions Our review explored definitions, determinants, and processes of safety climate as well as consequences for people, teams and organizations.  We conclude with an overarching framework that summarizes key features of the review and point to future directions for research and practice. We consider future directions within each of the topic areas plus broader implications based on the changing nature of work, environmental concerns, and economic development. 5.1   New challenges from the transformation of organisations  The first section of our review aimed to summarize the existing approaches in the definition of safety climate nature and contents, integrating complementary approaches over the past 35 years of research. A broad consensus defines safety climate as a perceptual, collective, multidimensional and multilevel organizational phenomenon. Studies have also investigated how team and organization levels of analyses interact (Zohar & Luria, 2010; 2005), and how this cross-level interaction might generate emergent phenomena (Probst, 2015) affecting the final safety outcomes for organizations and teams. 30  The changing nature of work and organizations over the last two decades raises questions about the generalizability of current theoretical assumptions about safety climate.  The modern economy is characterized by multinational corporations, organizations with weaker external boundaries, more complex jobs, cross-national locations, and more heterogeneous workforce demographics and cultures. These changes in the external and internal environment of organizations generate implications that have yet to be investigated in relation to safety climate. Meta-analyses show that safety climate has a stronger effect on discretional safety participation than compliance, and those managers and supervisors are consistent sources of safety climate across different types of industries and organizations. However, working conditions characterized by higher levels of interdependence and constrictions in agency and autonomy might modify the impact of safety climate in unpredictable ways. For example, complex multi-team structures, where individual respond to more than one supervisor on various projects might influence the way the organizational climate for safety is perceived.  Future research should address the impact of these changes to understand how safety climate dynamics may interact with new organization, team and work structures.  5.2  New insights from motivation theories Our review of safety climate and motivation focused on the shared interpretation of organizational values in daily work activities, group dynamics and social interactions phenomena (Zohar, 2010). We have also seen that a well-established corpus of empiric evidences has been cumulated in the last fifteen years about the role of individual motivation as privileged mediation construct through which safety climate affects individuals\u2019 safety behaviours, with a special focus on discretional safety participation (Griffin & Neal, 2000). However, new conceptual developments from general motivation research stream in organization make us consider new conceptual horizons and research lines for future studies 31  and hypotheses. For instance, traditional research on motivation in safety climate studies underlined the relevance of the subjective-value of safety for individuals, on the basis of shared perceptions and sense-making of organizational values and priorities. However, recent development for self-determination theory and psychological empowerment motivation paradigms have opened new research perspective on a more active and interactive influence by individuals on the organizational environment through the creation of broader role orientation by individuals in safety management (Zohar, 2008).  Future research could try to address research hypotheses on how complementary motivational mechanisms might produce distinctive and emergent effects on different kind of individual\u2019s behaviours and team safety performance, envisioning multiple paths of motivational influence from management and supervisor safety climates. To date, this kind of more composite research model appears still exceptions rather than part of systematic research streams. 5.3  New outcomes for organizations Our review of the link between safety climate and organizational outcomes suggests a range of future research challenges. We began this last main section with an overview of traditional measures of critical incidents which are broadly used as reactive criteria to assess organizational safety and reliability. We then reviewed areas that are under-investigated in relation to safety climate such as productivity, organizational change, and innovation.  We described the dynamics and processes of safety climate might interacts with other organizational capabilities to create positive outcomes organizational systems. Areas that might benefit from further links to safety climate include organizational sustainability, workforce well-being, and continuous improvement in reliability systems.      32  References Bahari, S., & Clarke, S.

Students and faculty members from the University of Nairobi, Kenya; Eduardo Mondlane Uni-versity in Maputo, Mozambique; and the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban, South Africa are working with civil society organizations in the three cities and with York University re-searchers to show how organizing in local communities can help the vulnerable to deal with cli-mate change.As people in marginalized communities begin to address collectively the impacts of climate change, this summons political attention and allows those with direct experience to influence government policy.

Introduction The grave challenges posed by global climate change require creative approaches and contri-butions from all levels of society in order to develop workable and effective adaptation solu-tions which address society\u2019s most important needs first. This paper reports on the methodol-ogy and initial results of an ongoing project which demonstrates the value and potential syn-ergies of university-community partnerships focusing on sustainable development problems. Partnerships between university researchers/teachers and local community groups exist in many places, but academics generally do not comment on or emphasize the political impor-tance of these relationships. For example, in his excellent recent survey of global democracy-building initiatives, MIT sociologist Xavier de Sousa Briggs mentions the importance of grass-roots organizations and their links with government, but does not comment on how universities can facilitate this connection, or indeed on the effects of his own academic research in articulat-ing and building awareness about grassroots knowledge and its policy impacts (de Souza Briggs 2008). Similarly, political ecologist Joan Martinez-Alier highlights the importance of poor people\u2019s environmentalism and what it can teach both government and academia, without mentioning the crucial assistance researchers provide when they name and legitimize the knowledge of the poor (Martinez-Alier 2002). In terms of climate change adaptation, commu-nity-based approaches have clear political implications, and require appropriate research and training reinforcements, which are the function of universities even if grassroots organizations 208 Patricia E. Perkins and Ana Louise Tavares Leary do not make this connection (Ensor and Berger 2009). As Vandana Shiva has said, \u201c[The] best environmental education is in the minds of those that have suffered environmental de-struction. It is from there that the place of learning needs to start\u201d (Shiva 2008). This paper\u2019s explicit focus is the potential of university-based research and training projects to reinforce community-based climate change adaptation and political responses to climate change at the grassroots level. Since universities and poor communities often share physical environments in close proximity, where climate change impacts are felt and available to be studied, university-community collaboration is a creative approach to addressing the chal-lenges of climate change that is both legitimate and promising. The methodology of this paper is to describe one ongoing attempt to build such links, and then to discuss challenges, poten-tial and lessons for the future. \u201cStrengthening the role of civil society in water sector governance towards climate change adaptation in African cities \u2013 Durban, Maputo, Nairobi\u201d is a three-year project based at York University in Toronto, Canada, which links academic researchers and civil society organiza-tions in three African cities with York students and faculty (Climate Justice and Water Man-agement Project 2012). Its goal is to improve watershed governance for climate change adapta-tion and enhance resilience and adaptive capacity of vulnerable and marginalized groups, espe-cially women. This project, which started in 2010 and runs through the end of 2012, is supported by the Climate Change Adaptation in Africa (CCAA) program \u2013 a joint initiative of Canada\u2019s International Development Research Centre (IDRC) and the United Kingdom\u2019s Department for International Development (DFID). Like the earlier Sister Watersheds Project, also based at York University, this project\u2019s methodology includes collaboration between students, NGOs and academics as well as community-based research and environmental education. Project part-ners based in universities and several NGOs in Nairobi, Maputo and Durban are working to-gether to achieve the following objectives: \uf0b7\uf020 To characterize the institutional framework for urban water governance in the three cities, and explain how different actors within this framework cope with climate change and va-riability; \uf0b7\uf020 To identify and test viable alternatives for enhancing civil society\u2019s role towards adaptation to climate change and variability by vulnerable groups (e.g. by developing education, training and awareness programmes); and \uf0b7\uf020 To share widely the knowledge generated for potential adoption by other cities in Africa. The project is being implemented by the following community-based NGOs in Africa: Kili-manjaro Initiative (KI) and Kenya Debt Relief Network (KENDREN) in Nairobi; Women, Gender and Development (MuGeDe) and Justi\u00e7a Ambiental (JA) in Maputo; and Umphilo waManzi (Water for Life) and the South Durban Community Environmental Alliance (SDCEA) in Durban. The University of Nairobi (Nairobi), Eduardo Mondlane University (Maputo), and the Centre for Civil Society at the University of KwaZulu-Natal (Durban) pro-vide academic research coordination and student supervision for this project. The project focuses on low-income areas of each city, as these tend to be the most severely af-fected by periodic flooding and other climate change impacts. Residents of low-income areas often lack the ability to protect themselves against the impacts of extreme weather events (Adger et al. 2006; Toulmin 2009; Daley 2008). The capacity-building aspects of this project include training and research sponsorship for students and faculty in the partner universities; support for community-based research, workshops in low-income communities and secondary schools, cur-riculum and materials development, and skills development within the partner NGOs; training of environmental educators and organizers; contributions to the pool of experienced and qualified Climate Justice Partnership Linking Universities and Community Organizations 209 community workers in each country; strengthening of all the partner institutions\u2019 capabilities to carry out international projects; and contributions to the international literature and professional knowledge concerning water issues, environmental education techniques, and community orga-nizing for improved civil society involvement in governance. The networks being built extend from local and community-based linkages through regional and national-level policy group-ings to international academic and policy networks on civil society, watershed management, and governance. The political process of policy development and implementation depends on the interchange between civil society groups, researchers generating information on current realities, and gov-ernment. This project attempts to challenge the conventional notion that only educational insti-tutions \u201cproduce\u201d knowledge. Understanding community needs and what helps particular civ-il society groups to see and act to strengthen their role in democratic governance, for example, is something in which community organizations and NGOs have eminent expertise. This col-laborative approach, also known as participatory action research (PAR), is broadly defined as \u201cresearch by, with, and for people affected by a particular problem, which takes place in col-laboration with academic researchers. It seeks to democratize knowledge production and fos-ter opportunities for empowerment by those involved\u201d (Kindon et al. 2008). One objective of the project is to demonstrate how partnerships between academics and non-academics can be very stimulating and effective. This type of partnership encourages and allows the partner NGOs to reflect on and analyze their activities and to document \u201clearning\u201d more systematically than they are often able to do, by bringing student researchers into the NGOs as collaborators/interns. The partnership also encourages universities to be more prag-matic about teaching and research, and to \u201cfield-test\u201d approaches towards community organi-zation, equity, and capacity building. Students committed to the project\u2019s goals of supporting participatory engagement by local people in municipal water decision-making are given prac-tical opportunities to develop their skills, as a way of hastening each city\u2019s climate change preparedness. This project aims to contribute to the integration and meaningful participation of women in formal decision-making processes, as well as to build their adaptive capacity and increase their resilience and ability to cope with climate change. University-community linkages for improved climate change adaptation The single most important line of defense against climate change is education. Only with edu-cation can local communities, policymakers, finance and insurance institutions, and global agencies flexibly incorporate complex scientific, economic, and socio-political information about a rapidly-changing world into effective and efficient climate change strategies. This is why universities have a crucial role to play, and why processes that extend universities\u2019 ex-pertise and information-access to non-traditional communities outside of academia are vital parts of any equity-promoting climate change adaptation strategy. Training students in how to facilitate these extension activities by nurturing their community development, conflict resolu-tion, and environmental education skills is a major contribution which universities can and must make as the world heats up. Faculty members, too, need to progressively focus their research and publication efforts towards helping those first affected by climate change to develop adaptation strategies, and to guide policy development for equitable priority-setting. Civil society organiza-tions which are already working with marginalized communities on environmental issues can play an important bridging role. The ecological knowledge and awareness of local communities is an important resource for governments as they struggle to deal with the increasing numbers and severity of extreme weather events induced by global warming (Ensor and Berger 2009). 210 Patricia E. Perkins and Ana Louise Tavares Leary Climate change thus challenges universities to develop new ways of heightening their out-reach, relevance, and partnerships beyond academia. By creating and sharing new models of how to do this, universities can contribute to climate change adaptation and mitigation strate-gies which go far beyond a passive scientific understanding of how the Earth is changing. Between 2002 and 2008, York University, the University of S\u00e3o Paulo (USP) and the Ecoar Institute for Citizenship, an NGO in S\u00e3o Paulo, joined together to work on a project linking aca-demics and activists to strengthen the voice of marginalized people in water management \u2013 the Sister Watersheds project. Designed by renowned Brazilian environmental educators Dr. Mar-cos Sorrentino and Larissa Barbosa da Costa, this project tested out community environmental education in two watersheds containing University of S\u00e3o Paulo campuses those of the Piracica-ba and Pirajussara Rivers as well as the Black Creek watershed, where York University is lo-cated. The project aimed to increase the potential for marginalized community actors to partici-pate in local water governance. Masters of Environmental Studies students at York University whose theses analyzed aspects of the social-environmental situations of these communities were chosen to take part in Sister Watersheds student exchanges and spend 4-6 months in Brazil. Bra-zilian students also visited Toronto and researched similar issues there. One particularly produc-tive exchange group, composed of Brazilian graduate students in the fields of hydro-engineering, urban planning, ecological economics, and landscape architecture, contributed a detailed study of how the growth of the York University campus has contributed to increased flooding probabilities in the Black Creek watershed over time. The studies by the USP and York exchange students proved valuable for communities in both countries, and helped their faculty advisors to deepen their understanding of the relation between watershed governance, civil society engagement, and climate change leading to a number of new publications and research contributions. Similarly, the CCAA project in Africa reinforces the importance of the interdependence of traditional and local scientific knowledge combined with academic work in communities. This in turn encourages NGOs and community organizations to develop their transformative power. This type of work has proved many times to have great political weight. It can also facilitate the spread of important ideas regarding ways to confront not only climate change but also barriers to social and environmental justice (Desai 2002). Such barriers, of course, exist in both the Global North and the Global South. Student exchanges and research partnerships can highlight creative methods of addressing these barriers which are appropriate in both Southern and Northern contexts. For example, partly inspired by Brazilian examples of green community development and environmental organizing, students and faculty have contributed to activist projects aimed at environmental education and green job creation in the marginalized community near York University in northwest Toronto. One of these, the Green Change project in the low-income Toronto neighborhood of Jane-Finch, is administered through the Jane-Finch Community and Family Centre, a non-profit social services and community development agency. The goal of the project is to engage community residents in discussion about the environment and social justice issues in an accessible way. The project uses a social justice and anti-oppression ap-proach where community members have ownership over the direction and development of the project. A training program for Green Change Agents was developed, which included work-shops, tours and visits in the community. The award-winning training program introduced resi-dents to five key areas: energy conservation, waste management and recycling, green active living, social justice and the green economy (Phillips 2010). York University students have been involved in the project as volunteers, interns, and community-based environmental educators. Three York Graduate Assistants have worked this Climate Justice Partnership Linking Universities and Community Organizations 211 year on developing new curriculum modules for the next phase of Green Change agents\u2019 training. In addition, these students have helped with fundraising, report-writing, and local outreach and environmental education for those living in the social-housing building where a new Centre for Green Change is being built. Faculty members have also been involved; an Environmental Studies professor sits on the Green Change Project\u2019s advisory board, and other faculty members have participated in gala fundraising events. The CCAA project includes the same kinds of student internships locally, followed by in-ternational exchange trips which allow students to share their knowledge of climate change challenges and ways of addressing them. Graduate students based in Nairobi have produced an extensive study of the city\u2019s physical and institutional infrastructure for water manage-ment, worked with the NGO The Kilimanjaro Initiative to develop soccer fields (and resist pressures for expanding low-income housing in flood-prone areas) in the floodplain of the Nairobi River below Nairobi Dam in the Kibera slum, and helped the NGO KENDREN (the Kenya Debt Relief Network) to develop the rationale for considering climate debt relief as a parallel to financial debt relief as a climate justice strategy. In Maputo, students are working with urban farmers producing food on the university campus, as well as residents of several increasingly flood-prone low-income neighbourhoods who are seeking ways to mitigate cli-mate change risks. They are also contributing to curriculum development on climate change for local high schools, working with the NGO Justi\u00e7a Ambiental. In Durban, students are work-ing with civil society organizations \u2013 Umphilo waManzi (Water is Life) and the South Durban Community Environmental Alliance \u2013 on a range of activist education and green development projects. By providing skilled interns and volunteers for community organizations\u2019 projects, and training university students in how to do community-level work, the project is building local and regional capacity to address climate change. Research and policy implications of academic-activist partnerships For both academics and non-governmental or civil society organizations, such partnerships can bring a range of important benefits. These include the following: Environmental education Skills needed in community-based organizations and local communities related to evolving green jobs, and for effective public involvement in watershed and other environmental policy processes, can be developed and shared in marginalized communities via organized processes of continuing education (Pinderhughes 2006). These can include environmental education pro-grams for youth and seniors, adults, and in-service training for working professionals such as public health agents/nurses, teachers, and government officials. Local community organizations and NGOs are ideally situated to develop and fine-tune such educational programs, which can lead to increased employment opportunities and/or pay upgrades for local residents. University students can develop marketable and lifelong skills in community development and workshop facilitation, fundraising, conflict resolution and dispute mediation, management, video production, and many other areas by working with community-based organizations through internships and field experiences. Their writing and research skills can be very helpful to organizations which are stretched and generally unable to document and share their accom-plishments and creative solutions to environmental and political problems. 212 Patricia E. Perkins and Ana Louise Tavares Leary Creative organizing/workshop techniques/strategies and international sharing of ideas Ideas, designs, and financing proposals can be shared internationally through green/ climate change channels. For example, civil society networking surrounding the United Nations Frame-work Convention on Climate Change annual COP meetings involves a wide range of communi-ty-based environmental NGOs that have participated in the civil society forums accompanying the governmental negotiations. Academic conferences can bring together university-based re-searchers and local environmental activists for useful discussions on innovative policy and gras-sroots solutions to the pressing ecological situations people face on the ground. A conference entitled \u201cHow will disenfranchised people adapt to climate change?\u201d at York University in April 2009, organized by the university\u2019s Institute for Research and Innovation in Sustainability, focused on local struggles and the importance of traditional ecological knowledge for addressing climate change in Arctic Canada, Brazil, South Africa and India (IRIS 2012). Likewise, Majora Carter\u2019s advocacy work highlights the common strategies marginalized areas can use in sparking green community development throughout the Global North and South (Carter 2010). Role of municipal government and public education Cities worldwide have begun to develop climate change adaptation plans and to take stock of their new needs \u2013 physical, social, economic (Lucon and Goldemberg 2010). When communi-ty groups organize to share their expertise and knowledge of challenges, as well as ideas on how to meet them, they may be able to build beneficial partnerships with local governments. Public officials everywhere need training in all aspects of climate change preparedness, and environmental education for the general public is also crucial in a warming world. Here too, networking, university support, and global communication help groups to learn from \u201cbest practices\u201d and creative ideas in use elsewhere. University partnerships can facilitate and add \u201cweight\u201d to local organizations\u2019 interventions with government officials. Mobilizing finance University-based researchers often have access to grants, information and research funding sources which go far beyond what community-based organizations can muster, and which place emphasis on practical applications of the research and teaching involved. For this reason, aca-demic partners can be strong advocates and partners of community-based organizations in their environmental education and political outreach efforts. Academic partners can sit on community advisory boards; edit grant proposals; analyze, publish and disseminate innovative community initiatives; and contribute to local fund-raising efforts in a range of other ways as well. International networking and information-sharing How can partnerships between academics and community groups contribute to research prior-ities, relevance, and success, and to global and local information-sharing which benefits all participants? Because of the power imbalances which are familiar to anyone who has at-tempted to undertake community-based research, it is important for partners to be very clear about the contributions, goals and benefits of all groups and individuals involved. Participation in research projects can give community organizations and NGOs unprece-dented access to international meetings, networking opportunities, and fundraising possibili-ties. Partners can develop joint research presentations and panels for international confe-rences, and jointly explore publication opportunities. Where universities have the means for Climate Justice Partnership Linking Universities and Community Organizations 213 online networking, Skype conferences, library facilities, and meeting rooms, they can share these and provide access to NGO partners which can be an important benefit for them. The increased dissemination and publicity of community-based activism which flows from aca-demic attention can have important policy benefits. Student-initiated and produced videos, maps, social networking, website content, reports, grant applications, and other products can greatly contribute to NGOs\u2019 work. The benefits also flow both ways, and can strongly influence and benefit university part-ners as well. For example, York University has begun a tradition of inviting a series of \u201ccommu-nity scholars\u201d to give seminars, advise students, and contribute in a practical and experiential way to classroom teaching over the course of a term or academic year. At an international level, the Dame Nita Barrow Distinguished Visitorship speaker series at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education of the University of Toronto brings international women activists from the Global South to lecture and meet with students each year. And of course, access to community-based experts on relevant and pressing research issues is a key benefit for aca-demics of partnerships extending beyond the university. Research projects tend to lead to opportunities for further research, exploration, and expan-sion of research partnerships. In this way, they both advance the careers, teaching relevance, and professional development of the faculty members and students involved, and they also contribute to global synergies and advance understanding of complex global problems such as climate change. Conclusion The social change which is fundamental to \u201csustainable development\u201d anywhere \u2013 in the South or the North \u2013 depends on a synergistic mix of information, public education, leadership, institutional flexibility, and political organizing (as well as serendipity). Research, when it is locally motivated and relevant and reinforces grassroots ecological, social, and political knowledge, is a fundamental pillar of interactive development, generating the current infor-mation which underlies public education and organizing around issues of importance for so-cial change (Faber and McCarthy 2001). The Climate Change Adaptation in Africa (CCAA) climate justice project in African cities is aimed at generating innovative ways of strengthening the ability of civil society to participate in watershed decision-making, within the institutional structures set out by national water laws and other statutes. Graduate students from partner universities visit each other\u2019s campuses for short research trips and faculty members collaborate and direct the research, while the integral collaboration of community-based NGOs is essential. The NGOs have long experience with environmental education and organizing in low-income communities, and with presenting in-formation in multimedia ways which are just as accessible to busy politicians and bureaucrats as to barely-literate community residents. The researchers and activists working with the CCAA project are fortunate to share a climate of change-oriented exploration and communi-cation: What water-related issues are the most important to local communities? What are the best, most creative and interesting ways to help get the public involved in and knowledgeable about water issues? When the law creates space at the decision-making table for \u201ccivil socie-ty\u201d, how can that democratic opening be used effectively and how can multiple publics and views be included? These questions are relevant in Canada just as in Mozambique, South Africa and Kenya, and in both urban and rural areas. There are many examples of synergies between research and development-oriented activism. Master\u2019s papers and other research reports, researched and written with project support, include studies of international synergies to address climate change: participatory community organiz-214 Patricia E. Perkins and Ana Louise Tavares Leary ing, women and water management, gender justice and climate justice, innovations in participa-tory water governance in times of climate change, politics of climate justice, eco-social com-moning of water, conflicts over water management, climate change and water governance, and detailed histories of local green community development and climate justice initiatives. Without the theoretical insights drawn from academic fields such as action learning and re-search, participatory planning, the dynamics of institutional change and political organizing, the CCAA project\u2019s work would be impoverished. Likewise, the project\u2019s grounding in com-pelling current political and social issues, and its links to communities affected by these issues, are also crucial to its success. Earlier writers on traditional knowledge and climate change have commented on the desira-bility of integrating scientific and community knowledge for better understanding of appropriate climate change adaptation processes (e.g. Reid et al. 2009; Berkes and Jolly 2001). This paper broadens that idea to demonstrate that universities and their local communities can fruitfully engage on many levels to build strong sustainable development and climate change adaptation partnerships with great potential. Given the pressing challenges posed by climate change, and the expertise and needs at the community level, university researchers and teachers must build the skills and train students to expand these promising forms of outreach and collaboration.

    "abstract": "Uncertainty surrounds the public understanding of climate change and provides fertile ground for conspiracy theories. Typically, such conspiracy theories assert that climate scientists and politicians are distorting or hijacking the science to suit their own purposes. Climate change conspiracy theories resemble other conspiracy theories in some respects, but in others they appear to be quite different. For example, climate change conspiracy theories appear to be motivated by the desire to deny or minimize an unwelcome and threatening conclusion. They also appear to be more contentious than other types of conspiracy theories. Perhaps to an unparalleled extent, people on both sides of the issue champion climate change conspiracy theories. Finally, more than other conspiracy theories, those concerning climate change appear to be more politically loaded, dividing opinion across the left-right continuum.

Sutton  Abstract Uncertainty surrounds the public understanding of climate change, and provides fertile ground for conspiracy theories. Typically, such conspiracy theories assert that climate scientists and politicians are distorting or hijacking the science to suit their own purposes. Climate change conspiracy theories resemble other conspiracy theories in some respects, but in other respects they appear to be quite different. For example, climate change conspiracy theories appear to be motivated by the desire to deny or minimize an unwelcome and threatening conclusion. They also appear to be more contentious than other types of conspiracy theories. Perhaps to an unparalleled extent, people on both sides of the issue champion climate change conspiracy theories. Finally, more than other conspiracy theories, those concerning climate change appear to be more politically loaded, dividing opinion across the left-right continuum. Some empirical evidence suggests that climate change conspiracy theories may be harmful, steering people away from environmentally friendly initiatives. They therefore present a significant challenge for governments and environmental organizations that are attempting to convince people to take action against global warming.  2  Keywords climate change, conspiracy theories, motivated reasoning, scientific consensus   In 2006 hurricane expert Bill Gray, an emeritus professor of atmospheric science at Colorado State University, called global warming \u201cone of the greatest hoaxes ever perpetrated on the American people\u201d (Achenbach, 2006) and said that after a period of warming, the Earth would begin to cool again in three to eight years. Eight years on, the Earth is still warming (NASA, 2014) but, if anything, the voices alleging conspiracy have become louder.  When prominent experts such as Gray speak, people listen. As an expert on meteorology, he is a trusted source of information about the world\u2019s climate. Other well-known climate skeptics include US Senator James Inhofe, who wrote The Greatest Hoax: How the Global Warming Conspiracy Threatens Your Future (2012) and again chairs the Senate\u2019s Environment and Public Works Committee; former Northern Irish environmental minister Sammy Wilson; former US vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin; and former president of the Czech Republic V\u00e1clav Klaus (Monbiot, 2009).  When people are unsure of the facts and lack the necessary knowledge and skills to interpret data themselves, they understandably turn to trusted experts to guide their opinions and behaviors. However, when people listen to climate skeptics, they enter a 3  minefield of mistrust, suspicion, and doubt. By no means do all skeptics advance conspiracy theories to discredit mainstream science and environmental policy. Nonetheless, theories abound that assert climate scientists are faking their data to obtain more research funding. Or, global warming is an attempt to promote nuclear power. Or, it is a scam cooked up by people who own shares in renewable energy companies. Or, it is a myth spread by environmentalists in the pursuit of a one-world socialist government. These are all conspiracy theories that have the power to influence what people think and do.  Climate change conspiracy theories resemble other conspiracy theories in some respects, but in other respects they may be uniquely harmful, steering public opinion and policy away from efforts to reduce, and adapt to, the impacts of global warming. Although conspiracy theories are more common, and more studied, than ever before, psychologists have paid relatively little attention to the unique properties of climate change conspiracy theories. This article attempts to identify what such theories have in common with, and what might set them apart from, other conspiracy theories.  Out of the ordinary Generally, when something big happens, such as the death of a president or a terrorist attack on a major city, people want answers. But for many people the answers given by officialdom are not enough. Instead they turn to allegations of collusion, intrigue, and cover-ups. Popularly known as conspiracy theories, these allege that such events are the 4  secret actions of powerful and malevolent groups\u2014rather than accidents, natural occurrences, or the overt actions of officially identified perpetrators (McCauley and Jacques, 1979). Conspiracy theories are a prevalent feature of contemporary culture, assisted by the ease and speed of digital communication (Coady, 2006). They capture public awareness, drawing attention away from conclusions supported by scientific evidence and logic and toward explanations that involve complex schemes and plots.  Conspiracy theories range from outlandish (for example, that Barack Obama and other world leaders are reptiles in human guise) to unproven (that the US government was at least complicit, and at worst responsible, for the 9/11 attacks) to true (the Watergate affair and the Tuskegee syphilis scandal). Other well-known conspiracy theories include the notion that Lee Harvey Oswald worked with the CIA to assassinate President John F. Kennedy; that elements within the British establishment killed Diana, Princess of Wales; and that NASA faked the Apollo moon landings. In general, people find it difficult to believe that such significant events can be explained by mundane or ordinary details (Leman and Cinnirella, 2007).  Climate change is perhaps a supreme example of this \u201cproportionality bias.\u201d It is a global-scale event with enormous significance, and is portrayed by scientists and governments as a consequence of small, everyday factors such as the transport we use. It is perhaps no surprise, then, that there are many conspiracy theories about climate change. Such theories typically postulate that global warming is not happening and 5  instead that scientific findings are being exaggerated or fabricated by people who have something to gain. Because they all have this thread in common, they are often referred to collectively as the Great Global Warming Conspiracy. However, the motives and perpetrators identified by the various theories are not always the same. Among the most popular theories:  Scientists are making it up for political reasons. According to this theory, scientists are fabricating or tweaking their data to gain political power and to support politicians\u2019 strivings for power. For example, Bill Gray has argued that global warming gives scientists and politicians a cause that will allow them to \u201corganize, propagandize, force conformity and exercise political influence\u201d (Achenbach, 2006). In short, this theory argues that the case for global warming is a political stunt.  Scientists are making it up to get research funding. An alternative theory, but one that still blames the scientists, is that data are fabricated or distorted because climate scientists generally struggle to secure research funding. Alarming data increase the likelihood that future research will be supported, so climate scientists are motivated to lie about their data to increase their chances of success. This theory implies that a cohesive cabal of climate scientists have managed to con governments worldwide and even dupe the United Nations into endorsing their lies.  6  Global warming is a green scam. Another conspiracy theory argues that because many people have invested in renewable energy companies, they stand to lose a lot of money if global warming is shown to be a myth. According to this theory, environmental groups therefore bribe climate scientists to doctor their data so that they are able to secure their financial investment in green energy.  Global warming is an attempt to promote nuclear power. Although its life cycle is not entirely carbon-free, nuclear power production emits relatively small amounts of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, and therefore does not contribute significantly to global warming. One of the many claims made in the 2007 British documentary \u201cThe Great Global Warming Swindle\u201d is that the threat of global warming is an attempt to promote nuclear power. Ultimately, companies in the nuclear sector stand to profit if nations become more dependent on nuclear power. Indeed, any scheme that puts a price on carbon emissions is likely to benefit nuclear power.  Similarities and differences In the examples above, the alleged conspirators are driven by either political power or money. This is much the same for many other conspiracy theories. For example, some argue that the 9/11 attacks were all about oil, that Princess Diana was murdered because she posed a threat to British political stability, and that President Kennedy was assassinated because he was unpopular with powerful people and groups such as the CIA and the Mafia. Someone always had something to gain\u2014financial or political (or 7  both)\u2014from these events. Similarly, all climate change conspiracy theories surmise that global warming is a scam manufactured by those who have something to gain from it (although the perpetrators vary from theory to theory).  But this may be where the similarities between climate change conspiracy theories and other popular conspiracy theories end. So far, social scientists have not conducted systematic research to examine exactly how belief in conspiracy theories about climate change is similar to, or different from, other conspiracy beliefs. While researchers await a new wave of studies focused on climate change conspiracy beliefs, comparing climate change conspiracy theories with other popular conspiracy theories reveals some crucial differences.  Motivated reasoning One key difference is that people have multiple, deep-seated reasons to believe in climate change conspiracy theories. Most people prefer to believe that they are part of an enduring and moral social group that can be confident and strong in the face of conflict and threat (Tajfel and Turner, 1979; Wohl et al., 2010). They also prefer to perceive themselves as moral individuals. Indeed, self-enhancement\u2014the motivation to feel good about oneself and maintain self-esteem\u2014is seen as universal (Sedikides et al., 2003). Although sometimes unrealistic, people are also motivated to believe that they are headed toward a bright future and that they should be optimistic about their prospects (Weinstein, 1980). It is obviously more pleasant to hold these beliefs than not 8  to hold them. More than that, these beliefs appear to be fundamental to people\u2019s ability to function effectively (Taylor & Brown, 1988).  Climate change presents a powerful threat to these fundamental and cherished beliefs about the morality of individuals (Bandura, 2007) and the legitimacy of societies (Feygina et al., 2010). The key psychological appeal of climate change conspiracy theories, then, may be that they discredit the apparently overwhelming evidence that humans are contributing to the destruction of their own environment. Denial of climate change is likely to do a lot more for people\u2019s general sense of equanimity than, say, believing that Princess Diana was murdered. Climate change conspiracy theories may therefore be a politically significant type of \u201cmotivated reasoning\u201d (Kunda, 1990)\u2014in which information that challenges valued beliefs is discounted, while information that supports them is accepted uncritically. Of course, it is possible for people to doubt the evidence for anthropogenic climate change without subscribing to conspiracy theories (for example, a person may believe that the planet is warming due to natural cycles), but the two are clearly correlated (Lewandowsky et al., 2013; Lieserowitz, 2006).  A related feature of climate change conspiracy theories is that they appear to be politically loaded, dividing opinion according to people\u2019s position on the spectrum between right and left. With the right wing emphasizing the production of wealth rather than its redistribution, and opposing governmental regulation and interference, it is not surprising that right-wing political identification is associated with disbelief in climate 9  change. This type of disbelief is unlike the rejection of mainstream science surrounding other controversial topics such as vaccination and genetically modified foods. However, as cognitive psychologist Stephan Lewandowsky and his colleagues have shown (2013), people who have a conspiracist view of the world and who subscribe to a range of conspiracy theories are more likely to reject the mainstream scientific consensus on all three topics.  Motivated reasoning may help explain why the mounting scientific evidence of climate change only seems to have yielded more and more conspiracy theorizing and controversy. Researchers have shown that exposure to scientific evidence about climate change can polarize opinion, rather than informing it in the rational way that one might expect (Kahan et al., 2012). When climate scientists are seen as part of a left-wing elite arguing for social change, their findings may be sharply rejected. It may seem perfectly reasonable for climate scientists to point to the impact of climate change on the world\u2019s least powerful people, for example. However, such arguments appeal more to liberals than conservatives (Markowitz and Shariff, 2012). Couching arguments in terms of conservative moral values, such as a concern for purity (for example, of the environment), could potentially help defuse the perception that liberal scientists are distorting or falsifying their results for political purposes.  Double-edged conspiracy 10  Another important and possibly unique feature of conspiracy theories about climate change is that there are powerful theories on both sides of the debate. With regard to topics such as 9/11, President Kennedy, and the Apollo moon landings, there is a single mainstream explanation opposed by one or more conspiracy theories. In the case of climate change, however, conspiracy theories that dispute the official account (that humans are inducing dangerous levels of climate change) are countered by others that affirm it. Indeed, some of these counter-conspiracy theories suggest that the official account has not been put firmly enough. A core proposition of many, including arguments put forward by organizations such as Greenpeace (Gibson, 2012), is that industrialists are orchestrating and funding a campaign to sow seeds of doubt and denial in public opinion (Fischer, 2013).  Other conspiracy theories refer less to byzantine scheming than to backroom political machinations. For example, National Geographic reported (Howard, 2014) that important information about greenhouse gas emissions in China was removed from the summary for policy makers prepared from the fifth Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment. The apparently intentional suppression of information that may be politically inconvenient raises concern about the international politicization of climate change\u2014specifically, that evidence of its seriousness and of its links to human behavior tends to be understated.  11  Counter-conspiracy theories may gain less airtime than those that underpin the denial of climate change. Nonetheless, they draw empirical support from extensive analyses of documented links between industrial interests, think tanks, and prominent climate skeptics (Dunlap and Jacques, 2013; Oreskes and Conway, 2010)\u2014and indeed from recent evidence that these links are becoming more byzantine and untraceable (Brulle, 2013). In short, they may be largely warranted, even unavoidable, responses to the tactics of an opposing lobby aiming to discredit mainstream science and policy.  No matter how plausible or warranted, the very existence of counter-conspiracies illustrates the corrosive and potentially recursive nature of conspiracy theorizing. In the climate change debate, conspiracy theories (for example, that scientists and governments are overstating risks for nefarious reasons) are themselves the subject of conspiracy theories (that industrialists are funding their dissemination). Both sides of the debate are therefore represented as insincere, and scientific data are represented as political tools rather than value-free observations of the world. This creates a climate of uncertainty and mutual distrust, which, especially when politicized, greatly undermines the possibility of rational debate and discourse about the appropriate policy response to scientific findings (Cohen, 2003). Perhaps most corrosive, the sum total of these effects is to create the impression that the climate change debate boils down to a choice between competing conspiracy theories.  12  In a world where people disbelieve science or are unsure about the meaning of scientific claims, the sources of conspiracy theories are extremely important. When people are unsure or lack confidence in data, they tend to rely on secondhand knowledge, typically presented by authoritative media sources. But when well-known and seemingly authoritative sources endorse conspiracy theories, as in the case of Bill Gray and others mentioned earlier, people are likely to take notice (Chaiken and Maheswaran, 1994). Known as \u201cknowledge by authority\u201d in philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce\u2019s taxonomy of epistemology, reliance on others for information cannot guarantee impartiality or accuracy (Hovland and Weiss, 1951). Further, if climate change conspiracy theories make people doubtful of scientific claims, people may be less likely to support action or take measures to reduce the problem.  Impacts of climate change conspiracy theories Although often parodied as inconsequential fantasies entertained by disenfranchised people on the fringes of society, conspiracy theories can influence what ordinary people intend to do in important domains. For example, social psychologist Daniel Jolley and one of the authors of this article asked people participating in a study to read a fictitious article about vaccines (Jolley and Douglas, 2014a). One set of participants read an article arguing that people within the vaccine industry are guilty of misrepresenting or hiding data about the efficacy and safety of vaccines, and that their actions are motivated by profit. These are typical conspiracy theories advocated by members of the anti-vaccine movement. The other study participants read a piece that refuted common 13  anti-vaccine conspiracy theories. The study reported that people in the first group, who were exposed to the anti-vaccine conspiracy theories, were more reluctant to have a fictional child vaccinated.  Using a similar experimental design, other research has shown that people who read materials arguing that governments are involved in elaborate plots and schemes, such as the alleged 9/11 conspiracy, indicated a reluctance to vote in general elections compared to those who read information that refutes such conspiracy theories (Jolley and Douglas, 2014b). Further, research has shown that people can be influenced by exposure to conspiracy theories without being aware that they have been persuaded (Douglas and Sutton, 2008).  Of particular importance here, some recent research has explored the impact of climate change conspiracy theories. Jolley and Douglas (2014b) asked people to read a paragraph about climate change. In one condition, the paragraph contained information supporting conspiracy theories (for example, that climate scientists are doctoring their data); in another condition, the paragraph refuted the conspiracy theories. Exposure to conspiracy theories reduced people\u2019s intentions to reduce their carbon footprint, relative to people who were given refuting information.  So, what can (or should) be done about climate change conspiracy theories? While scholars are waiting for more studies of climate change conspiracies specifically, they 14  have suggested general strategies for undermining conspiracy theories to ensure public safety (for example, see Sunstein and Vermeule, 2009). These strategies include banning conspiracy theories altogether, imposing financial disincentives (such as taxes) on people who disseminate such theories, and engaging in \u201ccognitive infiltration\u201d\u2014joining conspiracy groups and counter-arguing against their conspiracy claims. However, these suggestions are arguably undemocratic, unreasonable, and impractical. They may also backfire, and the likelihood of \u201cconversion\u201d using scientific evidence is limited because climate change denial increasingly reflects ideological positions (Bain et al., 2012).  Instead of reactive approaches like these, it may instead be possible to take a proactive stance by addressing the underlying conditions that allow conspiracy theories to prosper. As in the field of medicine, approaches to climate change conspiracy theories could be therapeutic (akin to treating or curing an existing illness) or preventive (like seeking to avoid or reduce the occurrence of an illness). Several factors that are associated with conspiracy belief are alterable. Factors such as uncertainty (van Prooijen and Jostmann, 2013), feelings of powerlessness (Abalakina-Paap et al., 1999), political cynicism (Swami, 2012), magical thinking (Barron et al., 2014), and errors in logical and probabilistic reasoning (Brotherton and French, 2014) are all associated with belief in conspiracy theories. Addressing these factors may decrease reliance on conspiracy explanations. For example, business professors Jennifer Whitson and Adam Galinsky (2008) showed that a lack of control increases belief in conspiracy theories. Therefore, 15  inducing instead a strong sense of control may reduce reliance on conspiracy theories. Future research will determine whether interventions are effective. They need not be tailored toward specific conspiracy theories, and they may have broader benefits such as improving openness and transparency in society, and critical and rational thinking in its citizens.  Exploring the impact of climate change conspiracy theories is timely and important. They cannot be dismissed as trivial or harmless. Governments and environmental professionals need to be aware that conspiracy theories may be detrimental to their efforts to encourage pro-environmental action. A future challenge for researchers will be to identify ways to responsibly deal with the consequences of climate change conspiracy theories.   Author biographies  Karen M.

Keywords: Safety climate; Safety culture; Safety climate factors; Perception; Attitude   1.0 Introduction  Many researchers and practitioners have explored various techniques, including some practices in other industries to reduce construction accidents and deaths. Although they may be well developed, it is still difficult to apply these practices in the construction industry. This means that the construction industry, as a sector, demands more specific safety practices. Improvements in working conditions and innovations in the equipment used in the industry are not enough to improve safety performance because organizational culture and human factors also play critical roles. In this regard, the influence of safety climate has attracted more and more attention in the development of safety practices. The safety climate is a term commonly used to describe the sum of employees\u2019 perceptions and attitudes regarding overall safety within their organization. Nowadays, people always considered accident statistics and regular workplace audits as the expression for effective safety management. But actually safety performances often ignore the people side of safety. Audits can also give an incomplete picture of the level of risk within an organization and what is supposed to be happening .Yet, very little work has been undertaken systematically to measure expectations and attitudes toward occupational health and safety at various levels of organizations. For that matter, this study has been conducted with aimed at determining whether identifying attitudinal problem areas within contractor organizations will be of any benefit as far as occupational health and safety is concerned.  1.1 Objectives  The aim of this project is to study the factors and assessment of safety climate in contractor organizations. To achieve the aim of this study, several objectives have been identified as follows: 1. To identify the safety climate factors and indicators 2. To measure safety attitudes and perceptions among contractors organizations 3. To determine strength and weakness of system interfaces among contractor organizations.  1.2 Scope  Firstly, the scope for the literature review of safety climate in contractor organization has considered the literature surrounding safety climate and safety culture. Effort also being done on seeking and browsing through the internet to seek extra information with exploring the following key topics, safety climate, safety culture, safety climate factors, perceptions and attitudes.  Specifically, this study only involves contractor construction firms that their employees had working experience with construction environment such as project managers, engineers and supervisory staff, safety personal (safety manager and safety officer) and others employees on that firm which involved directly in construction project around Johor Bahru district. This study was conducted by using one of the proposed methods which is an attitude survey by questionnaires form.    2.0 Literature Review  There are many definitions put forward by the researchers from their discussion according to their research findings. Some of them say that, safety climate is the surface features of the safety culture discerned from the workforce's attitudes and perceptions at a given point in time (Flin, et al., 2000).  For the purpose of this study safety climate is simply as an overall picture of the employees perceptions, attitudes and believes regarding to the safety and risk in their workplace.  Safety climate and culture are respectively considered subsets of organizational climate and culture (Coyle et al, 1995), and both have received considerable attention in safety literature. Actually it is important to clarify the dissimilarity between both of the concept because the aim of the study is to measure safety climate, not safety culture. According to Cooper (2000) there are three components of safety culture that should be in focus. These components of safety culture can be separated into: psychological, situational and behavioral aspects (Gadd and Collins, 2002).  There are several reason why the safety climate need to be  assessed.  Society is composed of people and their various cultures. It is because, there are a number of difficulties in trying to identify and change the culture of an organization. There is very hard in achieving cultural change because you have to change the fundamental beliefs and values that are shared by a group. These beliefs and values cannot just be created but this culture is developed over a period of time and depends on a number of external factors (i.e. religion, legislation, language and education). Moreover, as safety climate represents an employee\u2019s attitude to the original safety culture of an organization, an assessment of safety climate is seen as a valuable indication of safety culture.  Many researchers have investigated safety climate constructs (Zohar, 1980; Coyle et al., 1995; Williamson et al., 1997) since Zohar proposed the safety climate model in 1980. However, there is no agreement on the number of factors required in the safety climate measurements, or which factors are the most effective. There are several safety climate questionnaires that have been developed to determine the factors that contribute to the safety climate. Typically in the form of self-report questionnaires administered as large-scale surveys in different sectors, principally the energy industries, but also in manufacturing and construction (Flin et al., 2000).   The most commonly measured dimensions relate to management, safety systems, risk, followed by work pressure and competence (and rules/procedures may be worthy of more attention) Flin et al., (2000) although the areas are very wide. Previous attempts to replicate factor structures of safety climate scales have not been entirely fruitful (Coyle et al., 1995).Many questions remain to be investigated on beginning practices. If a basic factor set can be established, it must be shown to be reliable, valid, sufficiently broad and theoretically acceptable.  3.0 Study Methodology  The objectives of this study were achieved by using two methods. The first method was the literature review of safety climate in contractor organization. The review has considered the literature surrounding safety climate and safety culture and all the classification aspect and terms use are derived from the journals, websites, articles as well as research report.  Effort also being done on seeking and browsing through the internet to seek extra information by explores the key topics. The second method utilize questionnaires survey to asses employee attitudes an perceptions using several general attitudes dimensions, was adapted from Loughborough University Safety Climate Assessment Toolkit (LSCAT). The concepts relate to the employees' perceptions, beliefs and attitudes of people they could have been measured by either a qualitative or quantitative approach. For the purpose of this study a quantitative method was considered more appropriate which is an attitude survey by questionnaires form. Phase flow of the study methodology as shown in the Figure 1.  The full employee attitude survey questionnaire that we modified are divided into two sections consists of 49 statements;  - Section A - Consist of six (6) questions for basic personal information. - Section B - Consist of (43) attitudes statement which all requiring answers on a five point Likert-type scale (ranking from 1 = \u2018strongly disagree to 5 = ''Strongly agree').  - As well as a final question allows respondents to give any other comments they may have about health and safety in their workplace. Score item  =  \u03a3 ai Xi / \u03a3 Xi  Where  ai  = Constant expressing the weight given to i  Xi  = variables expression the frequency of the response for   i  = 1,2,3,4, and 5  Scores for Each Dimension  =  \u03a3 (Scores items)                   (Dimension Score)                          4.0 Results and Analysis  A total 80 sets of questionnaires were distributed to the targeted respondents around Johor Bahru district. The responses of this study were quiet encouraging with 60% of total rate responses. About 10 incomplete questionnaires with rate of 12.5 % had to be discarded due to an unacceptable amount of missing entries. As a result, 38 valid questionnaires were completed which represented a response rate of 47.5 % were final usable questionnaires subject to analysis.  4.1 Section A: Basic personal Information  These surveys have identified several numbers of basic personal information in order to help interpret the results. Figure 2 until 3 shows the personal information\u2019s of the target respondents. Figure 4 and 5 indicated that half of respondents were junior working in the less than five years old company and majority of them was diploma or degree holder as shown in Figure 6.

This study was conducted to determine the factors and indicators of safety climate within contractor organizations. There were many factors and indicators of safety climate that had been founded from the review of literature. However, there are no agreements on the number of factors required in the safety climate measurements, or which factors are the most effective. One reason for the disagreement because of factor being used by different populations in different industries or cultures. Another reason is that because factor selection is depending to the judgment of each study. From the review safety climate factors, the most frequently measured dimensions are related to management, safety systems, risk, followed by work pressure and competence and rules/procedures   2. The second objective of this study was to assess employees' perceptions, beliefs and attitudes of the contractor organizations regarding issues of safety and risk in the workplace. From the finding all the total average scores each of dimensions were in level of satisfactory with score from 6.48 to 8.04. It can be concluded that the contractor organizations have a good safety climate regarding issues of safety and risk in their workplace perhaps due to the contractor organizations having good safety management practices. Normally, the expectation from the finding was that if an organization had good safety management practices, there will be a better safety climate within the workforce  3. The third objective was to determine strength and weakness of system interfaces among contractor organizations by safety climate matrix. From the finding, all the safety climate dimensions scores gave the values above six (6) for the system interfaces of the contractor organizations. All the values have been categories as satisfactory values. Those contractor organizations have the positive safety climate toward safety in their workplace   6.0 REFERENCES  Cooper, M.

At the operational level buildings that are at \nphysical risk will need to be identified and preventative measures developed.  At the strategic \nlevel business practices will need to be modified to take account of changing life-style / \nwork-style patterns.  In all cases the facilities manager will need to be aware of the potential \nbenefits that could accrue from a changing climate and not just focus on the problems that \nmay arise.  Finally the facilities manager will need to consider to what extent their existing  \nasset management strategy can accommodate the demands of a changing climate and what \nchanges to strategic thinking may be required to manage the move from their current asset \nposition to one which better supports their business needs over the next 30 years.  The \nauthors suggest that such a change in strategy will require a fundamental shift in current \nthinking if it is to be achieved. \n \nThis paper presents the arguments for this change in thinking and presents the findings from a \ncomprehensive literature review that shows the need for facilities managers to actively \nengage in the development of mitigation and adaptation strategies for climate change as part \nof their broader asset management strategy. \nA CHANGING UK CLIMATE \n336 \n \n \nThe UK Climate Impact Programme (UKCIP) has produced a number of reports which \noutline the climatic and business issues facing the United Kingdom over the next 100 years.   \n \nWith regard to climate change, UKCIP have produced predictions for the UK climate based \non four scenarios (low, medium-low, medium-high and high) which reflect differing \napproaches to CO2 emissions (Hulme, 2002).  Over the next 50 years the UK can expect to \nsee: \n\u2022 A rise in annual average temperature of between 2oC and 3.5oC (this rise will be more \npronounced in the southeast of England than in the northwest of the UK); \n\u2022 A rise in the temperature of UK costal waters; \n\u2022 A rise in sea levels around the UK with increased flooding of low-lying flood plains; \n\u2022 A slight decrease in the annual average rainfall; \n\u2022 A significant decrease in snowfall; \n\u2022 A delayed onset of \u2018winter\u2019 and an earlier occurrence of \u2018spring\u2019 leading to an \nextended growing period. \n\u2022 A change in the seasonal distribution of rainfall with winters becoming wetter and \nsummers drier; \n\u2022 High summer temperatures will become more frequent with many more days reaching \nthe mid 30oCs; \n\u2022 Extreme winter rainfall will become more frequent with many more storms and \nassociated flooding. \n \nIn addition to these \u2018average\u2019 predictions the UKCIP model also provides detailed location \nspecific scenarios which individual organisations can use as the basis for predicting the \nclimate change effects on their particular business operations. \n \n \nIMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON BUSINESS FUNCTIONS \n \nAccording to \u2018Professor Anil Markandya (Metroeconomica, 2004) climate change will affect \nUK businesses in many ways including: \n\u2022 Increased heat stress  for workers; \n\u2022 Changes in patterns of demand for goods and services; \n\u2022 Increased flood risks; \n\u2022 Water supply constraints; \n\u2022 Impact on the insurance industry. \n \nIn order to prepare for these affects Professor Markandya has outlined a series of costing \nmethodologies based around climate change risk assessment and business decision making.  \nThese costing methodologies involve: \n\u2022 The identification of key impacts; \no Using impact matrices to provide an initial assessment of the major impacts \non the business and then refining the matrix to assess the lower order or \nsectoral impacts. \n\u2022 The identification of key cost elements \no Using a range of costing techniques (e.g. contingent valuation, avertive \nexpenditure etc) to predict impact on business function; \n\u2022 Assessing the potential for adaptation \n337 \n \no Using existing investment evaluation techniques modified to take account of \nincreased uncertainty and possible competitive gains and costing the benefits \nof adaptation to the business function; \n \nFinally Professor Markandya has identified the need for business to take a long-term, \nstrategic view that was both flexible and resilient enough to accommodate extreme conditions \nin its planning for the impacts of climate change.   \n \nIn a further report by UKCIP (Willows & Connell, 2003) the costing methodology outlined \nabove was incorporated into a wider business framework (Figure 1) that supports good \ndecision making in the face of climate risk.  In this framework a series of toolkits are outlined \nthat allow business decisions to be evaluated at each stage of the implementation cycle and \nprovide the basis of an implementation strategy for dealing with the impacts of climate \nchange. \n \n \n1.

In addition, studies of the \nconstruction process have identified the potential impact that changing seasonal patterns may \nhave on site logistics, ground working, and time delays all leading to reduced productivity \nand increased construction costs (Gavin, 1998).  However, what have been less well studied \nare the potential impacts that a changing climate may have on existing buildings.  The work \nthat has been done has identified potential structural problems associated with increased \nfrequency and severity of storms; increased ground movements as ground water conditions \nchange; material durability issues as ambient operating conditions change thus exposing \nsystems to climatic conditions that they weren\u2019t designed to deal with; and, specifically in \nlow lying areas, the problems of flooding and water penetration.   All of these issues will lead \nto increased repair and maintenance work and consequently increased pressure on \nmaintenance budgets.  Thus the challenge facing facilities managers is to develop both \nmitigation and adaptation strategies to manage the impacts of climate change. \n \nMitigation is defined as an anthropogenic intervention to reduce the sources of greenhouse \ngases or enhance their sinks (Metz, 2001).  Adaptation is defined as the capacity to which \nadjustments in practices, processes, or structures can moderate or offset the potential for \ndamage or take advantage of opportunities created by a given change in climate (McCarthy, \n2001).  \n \n \nMITIGATION STRATEGIES \n \nThe response to climate change within the built environment has to date mainly focussed on \nstrategy building, the production of government guides on risk assessment and decision-\nmaking process, and standards for energy efficiency in new buildings.  These initiatives \nprimarily address mitigation as they seek to prepare new buildings for climate change.  \nHowever, there is far less information available on mitigating strategies for the management \nof existing built assets.   \n \nJunnila, S. (2004) used a life of five Service Company\u2019s facilities management activity on \nclimate change, acidification, summer smog, eutrophication & heavy metals.  Junnila \nidentified that, whilst facility related activities accounted for only a small fraction of the \noperational costs of the organizations studied, they produced the majority of the \nenvironmental impacts.  As such Junnila concluded that facilities managers have an important \nrole to play in the development of mitigation strategies.  Similar arguments over the impact \nthat facilities managers decisions have on mitigation were presented by Troloar et al. (2001), \nwho suggested the need for strategies which sourced local materials and products in \npreference to those transported over long distances, have a high recycle content, and have a \nlong life expectancy and by Wyatt, D et al (2000), who identified carbon taxation as a key \ndriver for the development of mitigating FM strategies.  Wyatt argued that such strategies \nwould need to adopt a whole life cycle approach to built asset management that sought to \naddress more effective supply chain management, the use of design life engineering and \nservice life planning, life care & the performance life audits and the use of recovery \nmanagement to increase energy efficiency and reduce waste streams.  \n \n \n339 \n \nADAPTATION STRATEGIES \n \nHasegawa (2004) has also noted that the debate to date has focused mainly on mitigation \nissues, with less attention being given to the development of adaptation strategies.  In an \nattempt to redress the issue Hasegawa suggested the need for further research into the \ncomplex composite of various kinds of climate change impact and the development, by \ngovernment, of policy aimed specifically at the various stakeholder groups.  In arguing for \nincreased policy Hasegawa saw the need for clear evidence to support some level of \ngovernment intervention, a view that was also reported by Luc Salagnac, J (2004) who \nargued that more work is needed to understand the detailed implications of climate change, \nespecially at the local level and to provide sufficient evidence for policy-makers to make \ndecisions with confidence. Luc Salanac also recognised that economic instruments may not \nbe as important in adaptation policy as they are in mitigation policy.  Finally Hasegawa \nwarned against designing short-sighted policies either in terms of time scale and choice of \ninstruments. \n \nLiso et al (2001) emphasized the need to identify areas of vulnerability in construction \nindustry and to develop appropriate adaptation strategies as both the functionality of the \nexisting built environment and design of future impacts are likely to be altered by future \nclimate change impacts. Liso further argued that measures aimed at adjustment and \nalterations in rules and specifications within the building sector constitute only partial \nadaptation and that there is an immediate need for information and research, both with \nrespect to sensitivities in built environment and technical solutions to climate impacts on \nbuildings and a move towards holistic policies and strengthened institutional capacity if \neffective adaptation is to be implemented.  The argument for a holistic approach was further \nemphasised by Camillei et al (2001) who suggested that pre-cautionary measures taken \nbefore the full impact of potential problems were manifest could provide cost effective \nprotection from some of the likely impacts of climate change. Indeed Camillei went on to \nargue that, as adaptation at the design and build stage is generally much cheaper than during \nthe maintenance or refurbishment periods, adaptive measure should be integrated with \nmitigation measures.  \n \nWhilst it is clear from the above that Facilities Managers have an important role to play in the \ndevelopment of an organisations mitigation and adaptation strategies, what is less clear is \nhow exactly they can perform their role.  What form should an FM climate change mitigation \nand adaptation strategy take?  What should the balance be between hard FM issues (e.g. \nbuilding fabric) and soft FM issues (e.g. workplace ergonomics)?  Where is the evidence base \nto inform and support the development of mitigation or adaptation strategies?  What is the \nrisk of doing nothing over the next 20 years?  Do existing models allow the development of \nmitigation or adaptation strategies?  These are some of the questions that need to be \naddressed.  \n \nA NEW APPROACH TO BUILT ASSET MANAGEMENT \n \nThe traditional approach to built asset management involves taking stock of the condition of \nan organisation\u2019s built assets and then using some form of life cycle analysis combined with a \nstrategic asset management policy to plan asset maintenance, refurbishment, acquisition and \ndisposal.  Whilst this approach continues to be used by many organisations it does have some \nmajor weaknesses as far as long term strategic asset management is concerned.  These \nweaknesses stem from the theoretical basis on which the life cycle modelling is based.   \n340 \n \n \nIn essence life cycle modelling is an incremental process in which you start from a given \nposition along the time-performance line and project maintenance and refurbishment actions \nforward to return the built asset to a pre-defined level of performance (Figure 2).  However, \nrarely are future demands built in to the modelling process, and even when they are they tend \nto look no more than 3-5 years ahead.  As such the maintenance / refurbishment cycles are \ninvariably playing catch-up to the changing building demands.  This in turn results in \ncreeping obsolescence, which eventually renders the building a liability to the organisation.  \nWhat is needed if the model is to form the basis for the development of mitigation and/or \nadaptation strategies is a more effective assessment of the changing demands placed on a \nbuilding over a normal refurbishment cycle.   \n \nFor most buildings in the UK the refurbishment cycle is about 25 years.  If organisations \ncould project their building demands forward then, with a clearer view as to their long term \nneeds, it would be possible to develop a maintenance and refurbishment strategy by looking \nback from where they want to be, to where they are today.  In this scenario climate change \nissues could be introduced into the performance evaluation process with maintenance and \nrefurbishment actions planned because they are integral to achieving long term building \nperformance goals rather than in response to short term building problems.  Further, because \nthis approach would integrate maintenance and refurbishment planning into an overall asset \nmanagement strategy it should improve the confidence of building owners in the ability of \ntheir built assets to deliver against their business performance targets over the long term and \nultimately prove more cost effective.   \n \nThe logic outlined above, in which one is viewing maintenance expenditure as a means to add \nfuture value to a built asset rather than a recurrent expenditure liability, is an innovate \napproach to solving the problems of maintenance / refurbishment planning and represents a \nfundamental (step) change in current thinking. \n \nTime\nV\nal\nue\n/P\ner\nfo\nrm\nan\nce\nInception Handover\nMaintenance \n/ Repair\nRefurbishment Cycle\nChanging Demands\nObsolescence Gap\nRefurbishment\nModel of the Maintenance \u2013 Refurbishment life cycle\nCurrent Performance\n \nFigure 2: The building maintenance/refurbishment lifecycle  \n(Source: Adapted from Finch, 1997)  \n341 \n \n \n \nACHIEVING A STEP CHANGE IN THINKING \u2013 THE RESEARCH CHALLENGE \n \nIn moving from the theoretical model outlined above to one which informs the development \nof mitigation and adaptation strategies a number of key issues will need to be considered:   \n\u2022 How will climate change affect the value/performance of Buildings? \no Physical demands (heating, cooling, fabric performance, flooding etc) \no Operational demands (working environments, work patterns, occupation \npatterns etc) \no Business demands (business function, operating costs, customer expectations \netc) \n\u2022 What can be done at an individual building level to address changing demands? \no Physical adaptation of the building fabric  \no Investment in mitigating technology \n\u2022 Are all buildings capable of mitigation/adaptation? \no Disposal and acquisition of built assets \n\u2022 How can mitigation/adaptation activities be programmed into an asset management \nstrategy? \no How do you prioritise maintenance/refurbishment actions? \no What are the costs? \no What are the benefits? \n \nThese issues form the basis of ongoing research at the University of Greenwich.  The project \nis funded by the Royal Bank of Scotland \n \nSUMMARY \n \nThe UK\u2019s climate is changing.  Both buildings and working practices will need to change if \nthey are to meet the new demands placed upon them.  Facilities managers need to understand \nthe impacts that climate change may have on their organisations and develop mitigation and \nadaptation strategies as part of their long term facilities solutions.  However, what form \nshould FM climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies take? What should the balance \nbe between hard and soft FM issues?  Where is the evidence base to inform and support the \ndevelopment of mitigation or adaptation strategies?  Do existing approaches to maintenance \nmanagement allow the development of mitigation or adaptation strategies?  In addressing \nthese questions facilities mangers will need to move their thinking from a 3 to 5 year time \nspan to one which incorporates change over 25 to 30 years.  This will require a fundamental \nstep change thinking to view maintenance expenditure as a means to add future value to a \nbuilt asset rather than a recurrent expenditure liability. \n  \n \nREFERENCES \n \nCIBSE (2004) Understanding and adapting buildings for climate change.

To find out more about \nthe response of nonprofits to the recent economic climate, the \nCorporation for National and Community Service partnered with \nthe Johns Hopkins Nonprofit Listening Post Projecti on a national \nsurvey of nonprofits and AmeriCorps sponsor organizations. \n \nThe survey revealed that 80 percent of responding organizations \nexperienced some level of fiscal stress between September 2008 \nthrough March 2009, when the downturn intensified, and that for \nclose to 40 percent of them the stress was considered \u201csevere\u201d or \n\u201cvery severe.\u201d In response, nearly a quarter (23%) of nonprofits \nreported decreasing staff hours, a third reported eliminating staff \npositions, and 40 percent reported postponing the filling of new \npositions.

How did organizations experiencing fiscal \nstress and cutbacks or downsizing on personnel manage to \nmaintain or increase their client and patron service? \n \nAt least part of the explanation lies in the increased use \norganizations were able to make of volunteers. In particular: \n \n\u2022 One out of every three organizations reported increasing \ntheir reliance on volunteers to cope with the economic \ndownturn between September 2008 and March 2009. \nVolunteers and the Economic Downturn \n \n \n2\n\u2022 Whether because of the recession, or despite it, most (80% to 90%) responding \norganizations reported maintaining or increasing their use of volunteers, whether this \nwas measured by the sheer number of volunteers (88% of organizations reported \nmaintaining or increasing the scale), the number of volunteer hours (84% of \norganizations reported maintaining or increasing this number), the ability to recruit \nvolunteers (83% of organizations reported increasing or maintaining this capacity), or the \ncontributions that volunteers made (83% of organizations reported increases) (See \nFigure 1). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u2022 This reliance on volunteers is expected to increase further over the coming year.  About \nhalf (48%) of the organizations expect their reliance on volunteers to increase over the \nnext year, and only five percent expect it to decrease. This is so, moreover, despite the \nfact, or perhaps because of the fact, that 33 percent of respondents say they expect to \ncut staff in the coming year. \n \n\u2022 This increased reliance on volunteers seems to have yielded important dividends for \norganizations. Thus:   \no The 33 percent of all organizations that reported relying more heavily on \nvolunteers as a coping strategy during the September 2008-March 2009 period \nwere more likely than their counterparts in the overall sample to report \u201cvery \nsevere\u201d fiscal stress (40% vs. 26%);  \nFigure\u00a01:\u00a0Economic\u00a0Downturn\u00a0and\u00a0Nonprofit\u00a0Use\u00a0of\u00a0Volunteers\n11.0%\n9.3%\n8.9%\n5.3%\n6.4%\n33.0%\n65.6%\n53.3%\n48.5%\n50.5%\n44.6%\n15.4%\n29.6%\n34.2%\n36.9%\n39.2%\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1\nAbi l i ty\u00a0to\u00a0manage \u00a0volunteers\nAbi l i ty\u00a0to\u00a0recrui t\u00a0volunteers\nContributions \u00a0made \u00a0by\u00a0volunteers\n#\u00a0of\u00a0volunteers\nVolunteer\u00a0hours\nIncreased\u00a0rel iance \u00a0on\u00a0volunteers \u00a0as \u00a0a\ncoping\u00a0s tra tegy\nIncreased\nNo\u00a0Change\nDecreased\n%\u00a0of\u00a0organizations\nImpact\u00a0of\u00a0recession\u00a0on\u00a0\nvolunteer\u00a0use*\n*September2008\u2010March\u00a02009\u00a0vs.\u00a0September\u00a02007\u00a0\u2010\u00a0March\u00a02008\nVolunteers and the Economic Downturn \n \n \n3\no Yet these organizations were still nearly as likely as the overall sample of \norganizations to report that they were \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d successful in coping \nwith the economic crisis (58% vs. 66%); \no Similarly, these organizations were nearly as likely to report generally positive \nviews of their futures (69% vs. 75%). \n \n \nVolunteers Still Need Support \n \nWhile increased reliance on volunteers has proved to be a useful strategy for coping with the \neconomic crisis, it is hardly a panacea, particularly in the face of decreasing paid staff. As one \nrespondent put it: \u201cIf there is not someone managing these volunteers, it will be difficult to \nengage and rely on volunteer support.\u201d \n \nData from the Hopkins Listening Post survey already reveal an emerging challenge in this area.  \nThus:  \n \n\u2022 As Figure 1 above shows, while 37 and 39 percent of organizations reported increases \nin the number of volunteers, and the number of volunteer hours, respectively, only 15 \npercent reported an increase in their ability to manage volunteers.  On the other hand, \nover 10 percent reported a decline in this ability.  \n \n\u2022 Organizations that reported staffing issues, namely an inability to attract and retain staff, \nwere also more likely than the sample as a whole to report declines in their ability to \nmanage volunteers (27% vs. 11%, respectively); \n \n\u2022 Organizations that both increased reliance on volunteers and increased their ability to \nattract and retain staff were more likely to report being \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d successful \nfinancially as of March 2009 compared to those that increased reliance on volunteers but \nthat suffered declines in their ability to attract and retain staff (67% vs. 33%).  \n \nImplications for the future \nIt is clear that organizations are reaching out to volunteers for support.  Organizations that were \nhardest hit by the economic crisis seem to have been most likely to increase their reliance on \nvolunteers.  Thanks at least in part to the availability of volunteers, many of these organizations \nwere able to maintain or increase their client or patron services.  \n \nWhile volunteers are playing and will continue to play an instrumental role in helping the \nnonprofit sector survive the economic crisis without reducing its services, over the long run it will \nbe important to avoid thinking of volunteers as a substitute for paid staff. To the contrary, in \nnormal times it is precisely the presence of paid staff that makes volunteer assignments most \neffective. \n \nVolunteers and the Economic Downturn \n \n \n4\nThe Listening Post Project \nThe Listening Post Project is a collaborative undertaking of the Center for Civil Society Studies at the Johns Hopkins \nUniversity Institute for Policy Studies (http://www.ccss.jhu.edu/), the Alliance for Children and Families, the Alliance \nfor Nonprofit Management, the American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging, the American \nAssociation of Museums, Community Action Partnership, League of American Orchestras, Lutheran Services in \nAmerica, Michigan Nonprofit Association, the National Council of Nonprofits, and United Neighborhood Centers of \nAmerica.

INTRODUCTION\nWhether explicitly recognized or not, most decisions\nrelated to natural resource management rely on of\nsome sort of weather, climate, or hydrologic forecast.\nThe forecasts may be produced by teams of experts\nusing many kinds of data, sophisticated mathematical\nrepresentations of physical processes, and complex\nobjective techniques for combining results. Alterna-\ntively, an individual may rely on simple, subjective, ad\nhoc forecasting processes; they may simply have a\nfeeling, based on an implicit assumption that future\nconditions will be much like the past. In between these\nextremes exists a continuum of forecast methods, in-\ncluding simple statistical techniques based on limited\ndata and complex subjective heuristics. \nThe ubiquitous role of hydrometeorologic forecasts\nmade them an important component of the Climate\nAssessment for the Southwest (CLIMAS) project (Bales\n2002, in this issue), an integrated assessment of climate\nvulnerability. Good forecasts enable decision makers\nto effectively plan proactive responses to potential cli-\nmate events (Changnon & Vonnhame 1986, Changnon\net al. 1999), but use of poor forecasts can produce dire\nconsequences (Glantz 1982).

The survey addresses the types of\nforecasts that were issued, the organizations that provided them, and techniques used in their gen-\neration.

Fur-\nther, as highly interdisciplinary efforts, integrated\nassessments require a shared foundation of under-\nstanding across many social and physical science disci-\nplines (Liverman & Merideth 2002, in this issue). Not\nunexpectedly, many researchers joined CLIMAS hav-\ning only limited knowledge of hydrometeorologic fore-\ncasts. However, our discussions with members of the\nhydrometeorologic community consistently revealed\ndiscrepancies in their understanding of forecast avail-\nability, procedures, interpretation, and performance.\nThis paper surveys the weather, climate, and hydro-\nlogic forecasting situation existing in the US South-\nwest, with 3 main objectives: (1) To document the\ndiversity of forecasting entities, available products,\nand avenues of access that existed during a specific\nperiod, which can serve as a baseline for evaluating\nsubsequent advances in the production and delivery of\nforecasts. (2) To provide an efficient introduction, suit-\nable for a broad interdisciplinary audience, to forecasts\nand issues concerning their production, communica-\ntion, and evaluation. (3) To identify directions for\nrapidly advancing the state of hydrometeorologic fore-\ncasting in ways relevant to scientific researchers, oper-\national forecasters, potential users, and integrated\nassessments. \n2. METHODS\nThis survey synthesizes material from 3 types of\nsources: historic and current forecasts, forecasting per-\nsonnel, and the scientific literature. Descriptions of\nforecast characteristics were developed using qualita-\ntive analyses of multiple lines of evidence. Informa-\ntional inconsistencies were resolved, where possible,\nby relying on information accompanying the most\nrecent forecasts or by interviewing personnel involved\nwith the specific issue. Material was collected from\nApril 1998 through March 2000. \nActual forecasts and their ancillary information\nserved as primary source material. Although some\nforecasts were archived in printed form, many were\ntransient and available primarily, if not exclusively, on\nthe World Wide Web. Source material was identified\nthrough recommendations of agency personnel and\nforecast users and use of multiple Web search engines.\nWhile this study attempted comprehensive coverage of\nhydrometeorologic forecasts relevant to the South-\nwest, particular emphasis was given to products issued\nby the National Weather Service (NWS) due to their\nrole as the official federal forecasting agency. Hart-\nmann et al. (1999) documented details about the fore-\ncasts, including then-current Web addresses, although\nephemeral materials are not retrievable. In addition,\nexample forecast products are archived and available\nupon request.\nThis study also relied on extensive interaction with\nkey personnel from agencies involved in producing or\nissuing forecasts, providing data for making forecasts,\nor serving as a link for communicating forecasts. Indi-\nviduals were selected based on our understanding of\nthe forecasting milieu and recommendations by others,\nincluding the solicited personnel. Significant material\nwas obtained through a workshop (Institute for the\nStudy of Planet Earth, University of Arizona, Tucson,\n8\u20139 July 1998) that involved the NWS Weather Fore-\ncast Offices (WFOs) of Phoenix and Tucson, NWS Col-\norado Basin River Forecast Center (CBRFC), NWS\nOffice of Hydrology, Natural Resources Conservation\nService (NRCS), Bureau of Reclamation, Salt River Pro-\nject (SRP), Western Regional Climate Center (WRCC),\nand National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administra-\ntion (NOAA) Office of Global Programs, as well as aca-\ndemic institutions. The workshop relied on focused\ndiscussions to address predetermined topics (Whyte\n1977, Rubin & Rubin 1995). In addition, experts were\ninvited to describe various aspects of forecasting in a\nspecial session and panel discussion at the 1999 Spring\nMeeting of the American Geophysical Union (AGU\n1999). Extended discussions were also conducted with\nkey personnel from the NWS Climate Prediction Cen-\nter (CPC). Subsequent discussion and correspondence\nwere targeted at filling information gaps about fore-\ncast procedures, interpretation, and other issues. To\nprotect confidentiality (Dunn & Chadwick 1999), com-\nments are not attributed to specific participants; how-\never, discussion notes are archived.\nThis survey is conceptually organized into 3 broad\ncategories: weather, climate, and hydrologic forecasts.\nThe temporal boundary between weather and climate\nis indistinct and was sometimes a point of disagree-\nment within the forecast and research communities.\nThis survey uses the CPC (1995) definition, which con-\nsidered weather forecasts to cover periods shorter than\n1 mo and climate forecasts to cover periods 1 mo and\nlonger. Hydrologic forecasts cover both time scales due\nto the integrative character of hydrologic processes\n(e.g. snowmelt peak streamflow forecasts refer to\nshort-term conditions, but reflect the hydrologic re-\nsponse to melt of seasonal snowpack accumulation).\nQuantitative precipitation forecasts (QPFs) are in-\ncluded herein as hydrologic forecasts, because they\nwere produced specifically as inputs for flood forecasts\nand were typically considered hydrologic forecasts\nduring discussions with agency personnel. \n240\nHartmann et al.: Weather, climate, and hydrologic forecasting for the US Southwest\n3. WEATHER FORECASTS\n3.1. Forecast products and providers\nWeather forecasts examined during this survey en-\ncompassed a tremendous variety of types covering mul-\ntiple spatial and temporal scales and were available\nfrom myriad sources (Table 1). They typically tracked\nthe movement and evolution of specific air masses in\norder to predict meteorologic quantities (e.g. daily max-\nimum and minimum air temperatures) or the occur-\nrence of events (e.g. precipitation, tornadoes). \nThe NWS had 2 official delivery mechanisms for\ntheir forecasts during the survey period: the NOAA\nWeather Radio and Weather Wire Service. However,\nthey supported others, including the NOAA Family of\nServices, Weather by Telephone, the Emergency Man-\nagers Weather Information Network (EMWIN), and\nthe Web. NWS units maintained their own Web sites;\nthe look and feel of each site were vastly different,\nwith varying ease of product access.\nThe NWS reorganization, completed in 1999 (C.\nO\u2019Hara 1999: www.fcw.com/fcw/articles/1999/fcw_\n080299_894.asp), generally shifted responsibilities for\nproducing and issuing official weather forecasts to a\ngreater number of local WFOs; 11 WFOs provided cov-\nerage for the Southwest, including the Colorado River\nbasin. Routine general products from the WFOs con-\nsisted of brief text and tabular products presenting, at\nminimum, predictions of high and low temperatures,\nlikelihood of precipitation, and wind direction and\nspeed. They were usually issued twice daily, but\nupdated more frequently when rapidly changing con-\nditions warranted. Zone forecasts typically covered\nportions of counties (e.g. 40 zones in Arizona), while\nstate forecasts covered larger regions (e.g. 6 regions \nin Arizona). Area forecast discussions were unique\namong routine products. They used technical terms\nand cryptic abbreviations, but presented the rationale\nWFO forecasters used in making a specific forecast,\nincluding recent performance of numerical weather\nmodels, unique conditions underlying skepticism or\nconfidence in model results, conditions creating fore-\ncast difficulty and uncertainty, and prospects for\nimproved or deteriorating predictability. In 1998, the\nTucson, Arizona, WFO began to experimentally issue\nSoutheast Arizona Convective Outlooks each after-\nnoon during the summer monsoon season. They dif-\nfered from routine products by forecasting thunder-\nstorm areal coverage and location, expected direction\nof motion, and conditional probabilities of storm sever-\nity and precipitation totals.\nWhen faced with prospective extreme weather con-\nditions, WFOs could issue a variety of special purpose\nforecasts for locations (e.g. canyon areas known for\nhazardous driving during high winds) within their\ncounty warning areas, and they had the responsibility\nfor issuing official warnings for severe thunderstorms\nand tornadoes. However, the NWS Storm Prediction\nCenter had the responsibility for issuing official\nwatches for severe thunderstorms and tornadoes,\nwhich were then transmitted by affected WFOs\nthrough their usual mechanisms, creating the need for\nintensive communication and coordination among\nnational, regional, and local NWS units. Similar rela-\ntionships existed between WFOs and the NWS\nNational Hurricane Center regarding infrequent tropi-\ncal storms and hurricanes affecting the Southwest.\nThe CPC was responsible for the NWS threats\nassessment, which transitioned from \u2018experimental\u2019 to\n\u2018operational\u2019 status during the study period. The fore-\ncasts consisted of weekly graphical products, some-\ntimes supplemented with daily text updates, describ-\ning the potential for extreme hydrometeorologic\nconditions (e.g. extreme heat or heavy rains) based on\nNWS medium- (3 to 5 d), extended- (6 to 10 d), and\nlong- (monthly and seasonal) range forecasts, as well\nas hydrologic forecasts. \nForecasts from non-WFO NWS, NOAA, Department\nof Defense, and National Aeronautical and Space\nAdministration units and several universities were rou-\ntinely accessible to the public, although they were\ngenerated to provide guidance to the WFOs in creating\nlocal forecasts or to support internal operations, includ-\ning research activities. These products were highly\nvaried in content, complexity, and clarity of communi-\ncation, but typically simply provided output from indi-\nvidual numerical weather models. \nCommercial forecasts consisted of 2 types: free and\nfee- or subscription-based. Free forecasts were often\nassociated with providers deriving revenue from\nadvertising (e.g. The Weather Channel) or were\noffered as an inducement to cost-based forecasts (e.g.\nBaja Weather Service). Costs were typically associated\nwith unique types of forecasts for user-specified loca-\ntions. Some custom forecasts ultimately appeared in\nnewspapers and on television and radio. Some vendors\ntargeted specific markets by offering \u2018one-stop shop-\nping\u2019 for easy access to forecasts, along with other\nmarket-sector information (e.g. Weather Sites, Fox\nWeather). Often, free forecasts were simply copies of\nofficial NWS forecasts or products available from other\nproviders, although they sometimes included only por-\ntions of the original forecast and ignored essential\nancillary products (e.g. text discussions, forecast cate-\ngory definitions). Unisys transformed NWS weather\nmodel results into attractive graphical products, citing\nthe NWS as the data source; however, it was not clear\nthat the product represented intermediary NWS infor-\nmation, not an official forecast.

The Old\nFarmer\u2019s Almanac, an annual magazine, was unique in\nproviding weather forecasts (e.g. \u2018stormy\u2019, \u2018sunny\u2019)\nwith lead times of more than a year in advance; while\nthe forecasts were not based on modern scientific\n242\nForecast producers and providers\nGovernment agencies\nNational Weather Service (NWS)\nWeather Forecast Offices\nStorm Prediction Center \nNational Hurricane Center\nClimate Prediction Center \nHydrometeorological Prediction Center\nAviation Weather Center \nAir Resources Laboratory/NOAA\nForecast Systems Laboratory/NOAA\nNational Severe Storms Laboratory/NOAA\nGlobal Hydrology and Climate Center/NASA\nNaval Research Laboratory\nAir Force Weather Agency\nWestern Regional Climate Center (WRCC)a\nBureau of Reclamation\nNatural Resources Conservation Service\nUniversities\nColorado State University\nPennsylvania State University\nUniversity of Arizona\nUniversity of Utah\nUniversity of Washington\nCommercial entitiesb\nMedia outlets\nUSA Today\nLocal newspapers\nRadio stations\nLocal television stations\nThe Weather Channel\nCable News Network (CNN)\nAccuWeather\nBaja Weather Service\nCompu-Weather\nFox Weather\nKavouras, Inc.\nUnisys\nWeather Sites, Inc.\nSalt River Project (SRP)c\nThe Old Farmer\u2019s Almanac\nPrivate non-commercial entities\nAmateur forecasters\nHobbyists\nForecast products\nNWS products\nRoutine general products (1\u20133 d coverage)d\nLocal forecasts\nZone forecasts\nState forecasts\nArea forecast discussions\nSpecial-purpose products (min to h coverage)\nShort-term forecasts\nWatches and warnings\nSevere thunderstorms\nWinter storms\nTornadoes\nAviation\nMarine\nWeather advisories (e.g. wind, heat, fog)\nSpecial weather statements\nSignificant weather outlooks\nUrgent weather messages\nMiscellaneous (highly variable coverage) \nAviation terminal forecasts\nDomestic aviation en route forecasts\nMarine forecasts\nFire weather forecasts\nSelected cities/traveler\u2019s forecasts\nThreats assessment\nDrought monitor\nSoutheast Arizona convective outlook\nExtended forecasts (3\u20135, 6\u201310, 8\u201314 d)\nCommercial products\nCity forecasts (1.5, 5, 10, 14 d)d\nThreat alerts (e.g. wind, heat, fog, storms)\nAgriculture forecasts\nFrost alerts and warnings\nFruit harvest forecasts \nSoil moisture forecasts\nCloud cover forecasts\nMarine forecasts\nRecreation, port, shipping route forecasts\nAviation forecasts\nFilm industry forecasts\nSki resort forecasts\nUltraviolet radiation recreation forecasts\nUtilities (e.g. power, transportation) forecasts\nTable 1.

As such, their prod-\nucts had similar caveats; in addition, continuity of\nagency efforts was poor, with many outdated prod-\nucts.

Forecast techniques\nWeather forecasts encountered in this study were\ntypically generated using complex, non-linear, dy-\nnamic numerical models describing physical interac-\ntions between solar radiation and atmosphere, ocean,\nand land systems. In making an official forecast, WFO\nmeteorologists subjectively combined results from\nmany models (Table 2), some generated by non-NWS\nentities, with recent local observations and accumu-\nlated personal experience. The models differed in their\nspatial and temporal resolutions, internal structures,\nprocess descriptions, and parameterizations. Using\nvariations of recent observations and model character-\nistics, repeated model runs were used to generate mul-\ntiple outputs, comprising an ensemble of forecasts.\nModels were often interdependent, as some provided\nboundary conditions for others, had multiple imple-\nmentations, or were also subjectively combined prior\nto WFO access. Details of the specific variables used,\nvariations in starting conditions, number of model\nruns, and model run lengths were highly variable and\noften difficult to explicitly determine from available\ndocumentation. \nMany non-WFO forecast producers presented re-\nsults from individual numerical models as stand-alone\nweather forecasts, although WFO forecasters consid-\nered them only as \u2018sensible weather guidance\u2019. An\nexception was SRP, which operated like a WFO. In\ngeneral, private-sector forecast providers had propri-\netary interest in their techniques and typically with-\nheld descriptions of their specific methods. \nThe numerical weather models listed in Table 2\nchanged frequently (sometimes almost monthly)\nthroughout the study period. Some model adjustments\nwere systemic, providing greater model resolution,\nlarger areal coverage, longer model runs, shifted\nmodel run schedules, or diversification of model out-\nputs. Others corrected process parameters to improve\nmodel performance for a specific region or type of con-\ndition. Notifications of model modifications were dis-\ntributed as public information statements using the\nNWS\u2019s standard delivery mechanisms, but the compre-\nhensiveness of readily available archived documenta-\ntion was erratic. \n243\nModel name and acronym\nNested Grid Model (NGM)\nEta Models (Eta, meso-Eta, Eta-10)\nAviation (AVN) Model\nMedium Range Forecast (MRF) Model\nMesoscale Analysis and Predictions System/Rapid \nUpdate Cycle (MAPS/RUC) Model \nNavy Operational Global Atmospheric Prediction \nSystems (NOGAPS)\nMesoscale Model - Fifth Generation (MM5) \nRegional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS)\nGlobal Environmental Multiscale (GEM) model\nUnited Kingdom Meteorological (UKMET) Model\nEuropean Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts\n(ECMWF) Model\nSources\nHoke et al.

Forecast products and providers\nCompared to weather forecasts, there were fewer\nclimate forecasts available and fewer providers during\nthis survey (Table 3). Climate forecasts made state-\nments about average or cumulative conditions, rather\nthan specific events, anticipated to occur over an ex-\ntended period of time. \nThe CPC produced the official US governmental cli-\nmate forecasts. Although originally distributed as bul-\nletins (e.g. CPC 1997), during the survey period the cli-\nmate forecasts were issued only via the Web. The\nproduct consisted of a suite of forecasts, issued\nmonthly; they included one 1 mo outlook and a series\nof 13 3 mo outlooks each offset by 1 mo. For any single\noutlook, the CPC provided: (1) maps of surface air tem-\nperature and precipitation probability anomalies; (2) a\nlegend describing appropriate interpretation of the\nprobability anomaly maps; (3) a text discussion;\n(4) maps and tables of historic climatology and proba-\nbility class limits; and (5) skill maps for some forecast\ntechniques. The climate outlook maps showed likeli-\nhoods of occurrence, expressed as probability anom-\nalies, for average air temperature or total precipitation\nover the period to fall within tercile categories defined\nby the upper, middle, or lower third of conditions\nreflected in the historic record from 1961\u20131990. The\nmaps almost exclusively indicated increased expecta-\ntions for conditions to fall in the outer categories. The\nlegend indicated that forecasters had an option to\nincrease the expectation for conditions to fall within\nthe central tercile. For that case, the legend decreased\nexpectations for the outer categories (maximum 5%\neach), but due to a typographical error did not increase\nexpectations for the central category. When forecasters\nspecified an anomalous probability for a region, there\nwas an implicit statement that the techniques used to\ncreate that outlook had some record of skill for that\nregion for that forecast period. In contrast, a \u2018climatol-\nogy\u2019 designation could mean several forecast tech-\nniques disagreed about possible conditions over the\nforecast period or that no forecast techniques had\nshown skill for that region and season. \nIt was common for other organizations, including the\nmedia and governmental agencies, to link to or collect\nand reformat the CPC climate outlooks. However,\nsome organizations provided only portions of the\nentire CPC product (e.g. outlook maps, without text\ndiscussions or even a legend). Some WFOs and the\nWRCC converted CPC climate outlooks into special-\nized products (e.g. expected number of rainy days).\nGroups that had established close relationships with\nsome WFOs received special climate forecasts without\ncost, while the WRCC provided their products on a\nsubscription basis. \nThe International Research Institute (IRI) for Climate\nPrediction produced climate forecasts similar, but not\ndirectly comparable, to the CPC official outlooks. IRI\nforecasts covered only non-overlapping 3 mo seasons,\nbut extended into Mexico rather than stopping at the\nUS border. IRI forecast maps specified precise proba-\nbilities (percentages rather than probability anomaly\n244\nForecast producers and providers\nGovernment agencies\nClimate Prediction Center/NWS\nNWS Weather Forecast Offices\nGoddard Institute for Space Studies/NASA\nGovernment-academic partnerships\nWestern Regional Climate Center (WRCC)\nInternational Research Institute for Climate Prediction\nExperimental Climate Prediction Center\nCommercial entitiesa\nSalt River Project (SRP)b\nAccuWeather\nFox Weather\nAdvanced Forecasting Corporation\nEnvironmental Dynamics Research, Inc.\nThe Old Farmer\u2019s Almanac\nForecast product characteristics\nProducts\nMonthly climate outlooks \n3 mo seasonal climate outlooks \nCustomized conversions of climate outlooks\nLead times\n0.5 mo\n0.5 to 13 mo\n0.5 to 18 mo\nVariables\nAverage temperature\nTotal precipitation\nHeating and cooling degree days\nCustom variables (e.g. number of rainy days)\nTable 3.

IRI maps\nof tercile boundaries indicated they were based on\nconditions during 1950\u20131995, not 1961\u20131990. IRI spec-\nified that the \u2018climatology\u2019 designation meant forecast-\ners had no basis for departing from historically based\nprobability distributions. IRI maps also masked out,\nand provided no forecast for, regions typically receiv-\ning less than 15% of their annual total precipitation\nduring that season. IRI forecasts showed uniform prob-\nabilities across large regions, rather than contours cen-\ntered on subregions with the highest anomalies. Addi-\ntional maps for the first 3 mo season showed\nprobabilities for conditions to fall within the top or bot-\ntom 15th percentile of historic records. Finally, only\nregistered users could obtain the Web-based forecast\nproducts, although several months after the forecast\nseason had passed, the products became accessible by\nall. While a disclaimer stated that IRI forecasts were\nintended only for research purposes, they had been\nused in applications (Office of Global Programs 1999)\nand products were sometimes labeled \u2018official\u2019.\nCPC also produced experimental probability of\nexceedance forecasts that contained much more infor-\nmation than their official outlooks. The experimental\nproducts consisted of a series of 102 graphs, with each\nseries corresponding to a probability anomaly map of\nthe official outlook and each graph representing a sub-\nregion within the US (Barnston et al. 2000). The graphs\nexpressed the climate forecasts using continuous dis-\ntributions of the probability that temperatures or pre-\ncipitation quantities would be exceeded. They also\nshowed historic observations, the associated climato-\nlogic distribution, recent observations, an envelope of\nuncertainty about the forecast distribution, and text\ncommentary that highlighted forecast attributes.\nBoth the Experimental Climate Prediction Center\nand the Goddard Institute for Space Studies generated\nforecasts, not for decision making, but in order to test\ndynamic numerical models they were developing or\nextending. However, the forecasts were publicly\naccessible on the organizations\u2019 Web sites and some-\ntimes labeled \u2018official\u2019 by the Experimental Climate\nPrediction Center. The organizations\u2019 forecasts encom-\npassed many more variables (e.g. wind speed, relative\nhumidity, soil moisture) than official NWS products\nand were expressed as quantities, not probabilities. \nSRP generated climate forecasts primarily for inter-\nnal use to support planning for their water resources\nand power operations. Other commercial producers of\nclimate forecasts were clearly targeting external com-\nmercial interests, including the financial and insurance\nindustries. Some vendors provided products similar to\nofficial CPC outlooks (e.g. AccuWeather, Fox\nWeather). Others offered forecasts with longer lead\ntimes (e.g. 18 mo from Advanced Forecasting) or spe-\ncialty variables (e.g. degree-day outlooks from Envi-\nronmental Research Dynamics). Many commercial\nproducts, standard or customized, were expressed as\nquantities, not probabilities. \n4.2. Forecast techniques\nCompared to weather forecasts, the climate forecasts\nencountered in this study were produced from a wider\nvariety of techniques (Table 4) that included both sta-\ntistical and conceptual modeling approaches. CPC and\nIRI forecasts were created by subjectively combining\nresults from several techniques and sometimes making\nadjustments based on current observations, recent\nresearch, and expert judgement. Others (e.g. Experi-\nmental Climate Prediction Center, Goddard Institute\nfor Space Studies) were based on unadjusted output\nfrom their numerical models. Techniques for produc-\ning commercial products were proprietary and not\ndescribed for the general public.\nCPC\u2019s roster of statistically based forecast techniques\nwas typical of those used by other groups. A form of\nmultivariate linear regression, canonical correlation\nanalysis, attempted to represent slowly evolving effects\nof ocean conditions on the atmosphere, such as the El\nNi\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the North At-\nlantic Oscillation. The technique predicted spatial pat-\nterns of temperature and precipitation anomalies based\non spatial anomalies of global sea-surface temperatures\n(SSTs), atmospheric pressure heights, and continental-\nscale temperature and precipitation. Screen multiple\nlinear regression was similar to canonical correlation\nanalysis, but provided only localized forecasts; it was\nused where significant geographic features (e.g.\nmountains, coastlines) caused climate to be largely con-\ntrolled by only a few ocean or atmospheric conditions.\nThe optimal climate normal technique subtracted cli-\nmatologic averages (e.g. 1961\u20131990) from averages of\nthe past 10 yr for temperature and 15 yr for precipita-\ntion, although other periods could be more optimal for\nsome regions. The technique accounted for interannual\npersistence of conditions within interdecadal climate\nregimes or long-term trends, but was apt to fail during\nperiods of regime transition. The soil-moisture tool used\nprior soil-moisture conditions and temperature anom-\nalies to account for intraseasonal effects of soil moisture\non regional surface climatology. Composite analysis\nand constructed analogs relied on similar conditions\nfrom the historic record (e.g. years with the same ENSO\nstate) to suggest potential future conditions.\nThe CPC typically made less use of outputs from\nglobal climate models (GCMs) than other climate fore-\ncast providers. The GCMs attempted to consider the\n245\nClim Res 21: 239\u2013258, 2002\nmyriad physical processes that affect climate, includ-\ning the mutual influence between the oceans and\natmosphere. However, some GCMs contained more\ndetail about slowly evolving ocean-atmosphere inter-\nactions (e.g. heat transfer), while others had more\ndetail about rapidly changing atmospheric conditions\n(e.g. deep cumulus convection). Typically, 1 or several\nGCMs that coupled ocean and atmospheric behavior\nwere used with recent observations and slight varia-\ntions thereof to forecast several possible SSTs. The\nforecasted SSTs and their slight variations were then\nused as multiple starting conditions for GCMs that\nfocused more exclusively on atmospheric processes.\nEach model run comprised 1 member in an ensemble\nof forecasts produced by a GCM. Details of the specific\nvariables used, variations in starting conditions, num-\nber of model runs, and model run lengths were highly\nvariable and often difficult to explicitly determine from\navailable documentation. \n5. HYDROLOGIC FORECASTS\n5.1. Forecast products and providers\nRelatively few entities were involved in producing\nhydrologic forecasts (Table 5), although collectively\nthe products covered time scales spanning the equiv-\nalent of both weather and climate forecasts. As with\nweather and climate forecasts, the NWS provided the\nofficial government hydrologic forecasts. WFOs were\nresponsible for issuing flood and flash flood watches\nand warnings for their service areas, but relied on\ncoordinated consultation with NWS River Forecast\nCenters (RFCs) and local emergency management\nagencies (e.g. flood control districts); 4 RFCs provided\ncoverage for watersheds in the Southwest. Depending\non the specific product, flood forecasts had lead times\nranging from minutes to several hours and areal cov-\nerage ranging from single stream locations to multiple\ncounties. They generally provided qualitative state-\nments about the potential for extreme conditions,\nwithout quantifying streamflows, water levels, or\nprobabilities of occurrence. Flood statements were\nused to terminate watches or warnings. Quantitative\nguidance products (e.g. headwater flash flood guid-\nance, threshold runoff) were generated by the RFCs\nand WFOs, primarily for internal use. However, at\nleast some WFOs also shared the products with local\nemergency management agencies. Also generated\nand issued by WFOs, flood potential outlooks pro-\nvided text-based descriptions of the potential for\nwater levels to cause damage to property, but over the\nnext several weeks. \n246\nTechnique name and acronym\nClimate Prediction Center (CPC)\nCanonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)\nScreen Multiple Linear Regression (SMLR)\nOptimal Climate Normals (OCN)\nSoil Moisture Tool \nConstructed Analogs (CA)\nComposite Analysis (CA)\nCoupled Model Prediction (CMP)\nInternational Research Institute\nClimate Community Model (CCM3)\nEuropean Community Hamburg (ECHAM) Model\nMedium Range Forecast (MRF) Model\nStatistical analyses\nExperimental Climate Prediction Center\nGlobal Spectral Model (GSM)\nRegional Spectral Model (RSM)\nMesoscale Spectral Model (MSM)\nOberhuber Global Isopycnic Ocean Model\nHybrid Climate Model (HCM)\nGoddard Institute for Space Studies\nSI97\nSalt River Project \nEntropy Model\nOld Farmer\u2019s Almanac\nAstronomical model\nTable 4.

HPC\nQPFs were publicly available on their Web site, but\nwere not official products intended for public use.\nThey consisted of national maps showing anticipated\ndepths of rainfall in 6 or 24 h increments over the next\n1 or 2 d, snow depths, or up to 4 kinds of excessive rain-\nfall potential, all without probabilities. \nA variety of daily stage (water level) or discharge\nforecasts were made by the RFCs and then issued,\nwithout modification, by the WFOs. Although given a\nvariety of names, the products often contained similar\nkinds of information, ranging from qualitative descrip-\ntions of current or anticipated conditions to reviews of\nrecent and historic conditions to quantitative stage or\ndischarge predictions without accompanying probabil-\nities. They were typically issued with 1 to 5 d lead\ntimes, although there was variation in temporal cover-\nage depending on location. The CBRFC also had exper-\nimental probabilistic discharge forecasts for some Col-\norado watersheds available for public access on their\nWeb site, although in forms (e.g. long tables of model\noutput values) that would discourage untrained users. \nHistorically, snowmelt peak flow forecasts and water\nsupply outlooks were issued by the RFCs in monthly\nbulletins (e.g. CBRFC 1992, 1998). However, during\nthe survey period, the products were increasingly\navailable through RFC Web sites and WFO delivery\nmechanisms. In the Southwest, peak flow forecasts\nwere issued for March\u2013June and March\u2013April for the\nupper and lower Colorado River basins, respectively.\nThey predicted maximum mean daily flows expected\nto occur, from melt of the past winter\u2019s accumulated\nsnow pack, sometime during the snowmelt season\n(March\u2013May for Arizona and April\u2013July for most other\nlocations). The forecasts were expressed as flow rates\nwith 5 levels of probability (90, 75, 50, 25, and 10%\nexceedance quantiles). They were also accompanied\nby historic maximum peak flows, average peak flows,\nflood flows (at which damages would begin), and the\nnormal timing of peak flow occurrence. \n247\nForecast producers and providers\nGovernment agencies\nNational Weather Service (NWS)\nRiver Forecast Centers\nWeather Forecast Offices \nHydrometeorological Prediction Center \nClimate Prediction Center\nNational Environmental Satellite Data \nand Information Services/NOAA\nNatural Resources Conservation Service\nCentral Arizona Project\nCalifornia Department of Water Resources\nBureau of Reclamation\nCommercial entitiesa\nSalt River Projectb\nForecast products\nShort-range products (lead times less than 1 mo)c\nFlash flood watches and warnings\nFlood watches and warnings\nFlood statements\nAreal flash flood guidance (zone, county, urban area,\nheadwater)\nThreshold runoff guidance\nQuantitative precipitation forecasts\nStage crest ( peak water level) forecasts\nDaily stage forecasts (river, lake, reservoir)\nDaily discharge forecasts\nRiver gauge reviews\nRiver recreational statements\nRiver statements\nRunoff recession forecasts\nLow flow forecasts\nThreats assessment\nLong-range products (lead times 1 mo and longer)\nFlood potential outlooks\nSnowmelt peak flows\nWater supply outlooks (seasonal streamflow volume\nforecasts)\nFlood control forecasts\nReservoir monthly inflow forecasts\nEnd of month reservoir contents\nTable 5.

Water supply out-\nlooks were issued biweekly, January\u2013June and Janu-\nary\u2013April for the upper and lower Colorado River\nbasins, respectively, but sometimes earlier with early\nsnow accumulation. They had varying temporal cover-\nage reflecting basin seasonal flow characteristics (e.g.\nJanuary\u2013May for the Gila River, April\u2013July for the San\nJuan River) and became shorter as the forecast season\nprogressed. Water supplies were expressed as \u2018reason-\nable minimum\u2019, \u2018most probable\u2019, and \u2018reasonable max-\nimum\u2019 seasonal total water volumes, respectively,\ncorresponding to 90, 50, and 10% exceedance proba-\nbilities. They were compared to 1961\u20131990 median\nvolumes and disaggregated into monthly forecast vol-\numes as well. CBRFC graphical products showed fore-\ncast flow volumes relative to climatological median\nvolumes, with no probabilities, while other RFCs used\nalternative formats. The CBRFC also generated alter-\nnative experimental water supply outlooks, based on\nnewer methods, but only for internal evaluation. \nConcurrently issued forecasts of flood control, reser-\nvoir monthly inflows, and end-of-month reservoir con-\ntents were all variants of the water supply forecasts.\nGenerally, they included more water-management\ninfluences and were expressed only as quantities (e.g.\npercent of 1961\u20131990 median flows, percent reservoir\ncapacity), without probabilities. The CBRFC also pro-\nduced extended exceedance probability water supply\noutlooks, covering up to 2 yr, for the Bureau of Recla-\nmation\u2019s use in regulating reservoirs along the Col-\norado River and its tributaries. \nThe NRCS also issued water supply outlooks for the\nSouthwest, in coordination with the CBRFC and SRP.\nTheir official forecast values were identical to CBRFC\nvalues, but included 70 and 30% exceedance quantiles\nas well. NRCS also produced lake and reservoir stage\nforecasts, peak-flow forecasts, runoff recession, and\nlow-flow forecasts, with varied temporal coverage and\nlead times, for specific clients under special arrange-\nments. NRCS products were issued via bulletins (e.g.\nSoil Conservation Service and NWS 1994), their Web\nsite, the NRCS Centralized Forecast System, and direct\ncommunication with clients. \nSRP, the Central Arizona Project, and the California\nDepartment of Water Resources produced water sup-\nply outlooks for managing their own water projects.\nSRP also produced QPFs for late-summer tropical\nstorms and during winter, as well as forecasts of snow-\naccumulation elevations throughout the winter. SRP\nQPF forecasts covered 6 to 24 h periods with lead times\nextending to 10 d. SRP products were available only\nfor internal operations, with the exception of the water\nsupply outlooks for the Salt and Verde rivers, which\nwere provided to the CBRFC and NRCS for producing\nofficial coordinated forecasts. \nDuring this survey, the NOAA National Environ-\nmental Satellite Data and Information Service had a\npublicly accessible experimental flash flood Web site.\nIt provided recent satellite-based estimates of rain\nrates, atmospheric precipitable water, and soil wetness\non which to base forecasts of flash-flood potential. It\nalso provided tutorials on making flood forecasts, tar-\ngeted at potential users (e.g. canoe livery owners).\nFinally, even though many universities and research\ngroups were involved in developing new hydrologic\nmodels and forecasting tools during the survey period,\nnone were found that provided operational forecast\nproducts. In fact, few groups other than those men-\ntioned referred to hydrologic forecasts at all. One ex-\nception was the Bureau of Reclamation, which pro-\nvided QPFs, obtained from NWS sources, through their\nsubscription-based AWARDS system and freely acces-\nsible Rivers and Meteorology Group Web site. How-\never, they did not provide other hydrologic forecasts. \n5.2. Forecast techniques\nHydrologic forecasts were made using a variety of\ntechniques (Table 6). Short-range hydrologic forecasts\ninvolved intensive coordination between WFOs, RFCs,\nand even local emergency management agencies. Like\nweather forecasts, QPFs were generated by subjectively\ncombining outputs from multiple numerical weather\nmodels, climatology, and forecaster experience. QPFs\nfrom WFOs were generally relied upon the most, by both\nWFOs and RFCs. Flash-flood forecasts often were based\non real-time monitoring of watershed conditions, while\nflood forecasts were also based on unit hydrographs dri-\nven by real-time precipitation observations, tempered by\nexpert judgement and guidance products. Guidance\nproducts were based on continuous accounting of soil\nmoisture and snow cover, generally using the same pro-\ncedures as for daily stage and discharge products. They\nwere generated using the NWS River Forecast System\n(NWSRFS), a complex software system comprised of\nover 400 000 lines of code. At the heart of this system\nwere models for snow accumulation and ablation, rain-\nfall-runoff relationships, and routing of flows down river\nchannels. All of the models were developed more than\n30 yr ago, although upgrades have occurred more re-\ncently. The most common approach was to use the NWS-\nRFS deterministically, using a single series of inputs (e.g.\nfrom a QPF) to produce a single forecast. Experimental\nprobabilistic forecasts generated by some RFCs (includ-\ning experimental water supply outlooks) forced the sys-\n248\nHartmann et al.: Weather, climate, and hydrologic forecasting for the US Southwest\ntem with multiple inputs selected from historic meteo-\nrologic records, termed ensemble streamflow prediction\n(ESP). The California Department of Water Resources\nalso used ESP for their forecasts, with the Sacramento\nSoil Moisture Accounting (SAC-SMA) model as the ker-\nnel.\nBoth the CBRFC and NRCS based their long-range\nforecasts on multivariate regression relationships\nrather than dynamic models. Unique regressions for\neach forecast period and location used subsets of\nmonthly or seasonal observations of precipitation,\nstreamflow, ground-based snow-water depths, and\nrouted forecasted streamflows. The regression equa-\ntions produced only a single deterministic water sup-\nply volume representing the 50% exceedance forecast.\nForecast volumes for additional exceedance quantiles\nwere obtained by overlaying a normalized error distri-\nbution, determined during equation fitting, centered\non the deterministic regression forecast. Regression\nequations for some Arizona locations incorporated\nSouthern Oscillation Index values, allowing their\nwater supply outlooks to reflect climatic teleconnec-\ntions. NRCS used curve-linear equations with vari-\nables decorrelated using principal component analy-\nsis. CBRFC forecasters selected one of several linear\nregression equations, some of which used transformed\nvariables. Additional statistical analyses were used to\ndisaggregate seasonal outlooks into monthly volumes.\nSRP used regression models as well as techniques\nbased on curve numbers and input from their climate\nmodel. After the CBRFC, NRCS, and SRP made their\nindependent water supply forecasts, they relied on\ntheir expert judgment to subjectively coordinate fore-\ncasts into a final official product with identical values. \n6. DISCUSSION\nIn reviewing the forecasts encountered in this sur-\nvey, several issues became apparent that relate to fore-\ncast producers or potential users. Critique of individual\nforecast techniques is beyond the scope of this survey.\nThe point is not to judge one model to be better than\nanother or to disparage forecasting efforts. Rather, this\ndiscussion is intended to initiate a dialogue about the\nprocess of developing and providing forecasts, includ-\ning how forecasts can be made accessible to a variety\nof potential users in ways that improve the ease, accu-\nracy, and reliability of interpretation and application.\nSome topics concern dilemmas that lack a clear way\nforward.\n6.1. The forecast milieu\nDuring this survey, potential users of hydrometeoro-\nlogic forecasts faced myriad products issued by a com-\nplex mix of governmental agencies, universities, pri-\nvate enterprises, and other organizations. Forecasts\nwere issued via a complex mix of media as well, in-\ncluding published reports, newspaper, radio, and, in-\ncreasingly, computers. The sheer variety of forecast\nproducts and sources poses the potential to limit the\ncredibility of any single forecast. A user might well\nquestion why slightly different forecasts are distrib-\nuted by different entities or, when forecasts are quite\ndifferent, wonder which is more reliable. As Pagano et\nal. (1999) found, users can become overwhelmed by\nthe many choices available and then settle for the fore-\ncast easiest to access, rather than the best to use.\n249\nTechnique name and acronym\nNumerical weather modelsa\nBalling precipitation modela\nObserving systems\nUnit hydrographs\nCurve number method\nNational Weather Service River Forecast System \n(NWSRFS)\nSnow accumulation and ablation model (SNOW-17)\nAntecedent Precipitation Index (API) models\nSacramento Soil Moisture Accounting (SAC-\nSMA) model\nLag and k flow routing models\nEnsemble streamflow prediction (ESP)\nMultivariate linear regression \nSources\nSee Table 2\nSRP (1998)\nMaidment (1993)\nSoil Conservation Service (1985, 1986)\nOffice of Hydrology (1996), Hydrologic \nResearch Laboratory (1998)\nAnderson (1973)\nKohler & Linsley (1951), Nemec & Sittner (1982)\nBurnash et al.

Techniques used to produce hydrologic forecasts, April 1998 to March 2000\naFor quantitative precipitation forecasts\nClim Res 21: 239\u2013258, 2002\nIn addition, the state of forecasting was constantly\nevolving. New products were generated and standard\nproducts were communicated in new ways, on an ever-\nchanging trajectory. Easily available Internet access\nradically changed the means for obtaining forecast\nproducts. Many products and ancillary information\n(e.g. technique descriptions, input data) were deliv-\nered primarily, if not exclusively, via the Web. The\nmost efficient approach for learning about available\nNWS forecasts was by contacting WFO staff, who also\nassisted in product interpretation. Pagano et al. (1999)\nfound that users who had ongoing relationships with\nWFOs had the best understanding of forecasts related\nto the 1997-1998 El Ni\u00f1o event. \n6.2. Official, operational, experimental, and \nresearch forecasts\nIn practice, there appeared to be little distinction\namong official, operational, experimental, and re-\nsearch forecasts. However, clear identification has\npractical importance because users now have direct\naccess to all forecast types. Operational products are\nroutinely produced by an agency, using established\nprocedures that have undergone extensive review.\nThere was some disagreement about whether official\nforecasts included any publicly available operational\nproduct of the NWS, the official forecasting agency, or\nonly some subset required by NWS legal mandates or\ninternal criteria. NWS documentation did not identify\nwhether products were discretionary or mandatory.\nThe NWS did, however, distinguish among official\nchannels for providing products; NOAA Weather\nRadio was an official source for weather forecasts; the\nInternet was not. Experimental products have not yet\nreceived official sanction, although they may be gener-\nated in an operational setting for an extended period of\ntime to test whether they warrant transition to higher\nstatus. Research products are at even earlier stages of\ndevelopment. However, some were posted on the Web,\nin forms that looked like operational forecasts, as a\nmeans of sharing results and demonstrating conver-\nsion of research into useable products.\nShould only NWS forecasts be labeled official? There\nwas clearly potential for confusion when non-NWS\nproviders labeled some of their climate forecasts \u2018offi-\ncial\u2019, but the NWS does not have exclusive rights to the\nterm (Kerr 1990). What responsibilities do research\ngroups have when making their forecasts publicly ac-\ncessible? Research forecasts may appear attractive to\nusers because they provide higher resolution, longer\nlead times, or precise quantities rather than probabilities,\nbut fundamentally they are more speculative than prod-\nucts that have advanced to operational or official status. \n6.3. Documentation\nDocumentation about the forecasts encountered in\nthis survey varied greatly in quality and availability to\nusers. Inevitably, ancillary information on the Web\nmore accurately reflected current interpretations and\ntechniques than published literature, because elec-\ntronic texts had been periodically updated. Discussions\naccompanying NWS area weather forecasts and CPC\nclimate outlooks were unique in describing details\nabout the production of individual forecasts. For most\nother products, those details were simply unavailable.\nThe absence of documentation, describing how expert\njudgment was incorporated into the forecasts or what\nconditions were used to initialize models, limits oppor-\ntunities to improve products through retrospective\nanalyses of forecast processes.\nClear documentation about hydrologic forecasts was\nparticularly difficult to obtain without going directly to\nthe forecasters. It appeared that descriptions of NWS\nhydrologic forecasting operations focused almost ex-\nclusively on plans for the future rather than actual\npractices, in order to garner support for a hydrologic\nmodernization initiative analogous to that for meteoro-\nlogic operations. In some cases the documentation was\ninconsistent and out-dated, posing difficulty in distin-\nguishing between modernization plans and what pro-\ncedures were really used at various localities.\n6.4. Forecast interpretation\nEvery advanced forecast represents a tremendous\ninvestment: in observation systems, computational\ncapabilities, physical process research, and profes-\nsional training. However, even the best forecasts can\nbe worthless if users misinterpret them. Text-based\nforecasts used terms with specific meaning for fore-\ncasters (e.g. Branick 1996) but without intuitive inter-\npretation by users (van Bussem 1999). Relative magni-\ntudes of numerical values, including probabilities, can\nbe reliably interpreted, but confusion often exists\nabout the meaning of forecast variables associated\nwith the probabilities (van Bussem 1999). \nIn particular, proper interpretation of the probability\nof precipitation forecasts engendered extensive de-\nbate. Technically, the forecasts indicate the chance of\nprecipitation occurring at any single point within a\nforecast area (NWS 1995). The probability can be\ndetermined by assigning the value for a single point\n(e.g. the local airport) throughout the forecast area or\nby averaging the probabilities for several points (e.g.\nrain-gauge locations) within a forecast area. WFO fore-\ncasters also described the forecast as the expected\nareal coverage of precipitation within the forecast\n250\nHartmann et al.: Weather, climate, and hydrologic forecasting for the US Southwest\narea. However, the 2 definitions are equivalent only\nwhen averaged over many events (Schaefer & Liv-\ningston 1990). During the peak of the summer mon-\nsoon season, areal coverage interpretations are appro-\npriate because storms are likely to occur somewhere\nwithin the forecast area. In contrast, winter forecasts\nare more appropriately considered an average proba-\nbility because winter storms have broad areal extent;\nan areal coverage interpretation would require rarely\nused high forecast values (e.g. 70%). NWS precipita-\ntion forecasts did not identify the intended interpreta-\ntion. Further, neither interpretation is consistent with\nwhat most people think, including many meteorolo-\ngists (van Bussem 1999), who interpret it as the chance\nof precipitation occurring somewhere in the forecast\narea. \nProbabilistic climate outlooks were also often misun-\nderstood, both by researchers and users. The concen-\ntric contours and probability anomalies in CPC fore-\ncasts appeared to be more confusing than the uniform\nregions and explicit probability distributions of the IRI\nforecasts. The climatology designation was especially\nmisleading in suggesting that forecasters attributed\nequal likelihood to all conditions, when they actually\nmeant forecast uncertainty was so great that likeli-\nhoods were unknown and no forecast was possible.\nThe climate forecasts also offered a limited perspec-\ntive, with probability anomalies expressed relative\nonly to a subset of historic records (e.g. 1961\u20131990 for\nCPC forecasts). With understanding of decadal- and\ncentennial-scale climate regimes improving, neglect-\ning to communicate more extensive historic informa-\ntion seems ill advised, especially for decisions sensitive\nto extreme conditions or with long-lasting conse-\nquences. \nSeasonal water supply forecasts posed a range of\ninterpretive problems. First, as \u2018naturalized\u2019 flows, they\nrequired users to adjust projected runoff volumes for\nanticipated diversions and reservoir regulations. The\nadjustments could be complex (CBRFC undated) and\nsignificant (e.g. 34 adjustments for the Colorado River\nnear Cisco, Utah, that cumulatively reduced natural-\nized flows by 30%), yet incomplete in representing all\nhuman impacts. Further, adjustments were based on\ntypical management decisions that would be unrealis-\ntic during extreme conditions. Second, for rivers with\nskewed flows, declaring the deterministic forecast\nvalue \u2018most probable\u2019 conveyed a false sense that it\nhad higher probability than any other value. While\nexpected values, statistically, are the most probable,\nmedians represent only the midpoint of a distribution;\nthey are expected to be too high one-half the time and\ntoo low the other half. Third, calling the 10 and 90%\nexceedance forecasts \u2018reasonable\u2019 maximums and\nminimums conveyed a false sense of their appropriate-\nness for decision making. Reasonableness depends on\ndecision makers\u2019 risk tolerance and loss functions\nunique to each situation. Further, interpretation of the\nexceedance quantiles was problematic because the\nquantiles were based on a normal distribution of\nregression error, shifted so the coordinated forecast\nrepresented the mean of the error distribution. The\nerror generally remained constant from year to year,\nneglecting variations in uncertainty based on forecast\nmagnitudes. Alternatively, ESP procedures provide\nprobabilistic forecasts that better reflect total forecast\nuncertainty, because they incorporate non-linear\nimpacts of meteorologic variability as well as unavoid-\nable model errors. \n6.5. Forecasting flexibility\nThe state of meteorologic forecasting can be charac-\nterized by rapid incorporation of research findings and\nproducts. New forecast techniques moved relatively\nquickly from research to experimental to operational\nstatus. Experimental products were routinely made\navailable to forecasters, and operational forecasts were\nadjusted based on recent diagnoses and improved\nunderstanding of ocean and atmospheric dynamics\nand linkages. The meteorologic forecasting situation\nresulted from a distinct shift in NWS institutional phi-\nlosophy (Mittelstadt 1997). Previously, NWS forecast-\ning models were limited to those passing development\nand evaluation thresholds; they were used unchanged\nuntil major scientific and technological advancements\nwere incorporated and evaluated. Subsequently, how-\never, model changes were incorporated as soon as they\npassed initial testing and operational adjustments (e.g.\ndata handling) could be made.\nIn addition, because meteorologic forecasters had\nbroad flexibility in generating their products, they\ncould combine results from many different NWS units,\neach of which maintained responsibility for their own\nmodels, as well as forecasts generated by non-NWS\ngroups. Forecasters had flexibility to give varying\nprecedence to different forecast techniques in differ-\nent regions, during different seasons, and for unusual\nconditions.\nIn contrast, the state of hydrologic forecasting can be\ncharacterized by relatively slow evolution, with con-\nstraints imposed by complex legacy1 data management\nsystems, longstanding standard operating procedures,\nand an institutional preference for uniformity in opera-\n251\n1Legacy systems neglect modern computer capabilities in\norder to maintain consistency with procedures developed\nwith now-abandoned computer architectures\nClim Res 21: 239\u2013258, 2002\ntions. During the survey period, the NWS had a strong\ncommitment to only 2 conceptual hydrologic models\n(the Antecedent Precipitation Index and SAC-SMA).\nForecast-improvement efforts focused primarily on\nimproved data access and displays, approaches for\nimplementing ESP, and statistical analyses of model\noutputs, rather than upgrading conceptual models.\nThe institutional philosophy was that new models were\nrequired to fit within the existing data-management\ninfrastructure and demonstrate improved performance\nin an independent operational setting over several\nyears. Those requirements frustrated members of the\nhydrologic research community who had developed\nnew models or diagnoses that they thought should be\nincorporated into operational forecasts, but who had\nnot developed operational systems parallel to those of\nNWS. \nNWS hydrologic forecasters were also limited to\nusing the NWSRFS and not using external forecasting\ntools, with 2 significant exceptions. First, WFO fore-\ncasters relied on a high degree of coordination with\nRFCs and even local flood control districts in their\nissuance of flood warnings and watches. Second, RFC\nforecasters cooperated with the NRCS and SRP in pro-\nducing seasonal water supply outlooks, with each\ngroup adjusting their independent forecasts to create a\nunified product. These relationships represent prece-\ndents for more efficient incorporation of new models\nand data into official forecasts. However, the hydro-\nlogic research community would need to commit to\nproducing their own operational hydrologic forecasts. \n6.6. Forecast performance\nThe meteorologic community has a long history of\nevaluating forecasts (Clayton 1889 is an early exam-\nple), but readily available information about the qual-\nity of actual weather forecasts is still rare beyond\nreviews of specific events (Brooks et al. 1997). Detailed\nevaluations of weather forecasts have not typically\nfocused on the Southwest, but instead have included\nthe region in larger analyses for the Interior West and\nCentral or Southern Rocky Mountains. NWS forecast\ngroups agreed that better verification of forecast per-\nformance was needed, especially at local scales (HPC\n1997, Junker 1998). Conditions in the Southwest, how-\never, make forecast assessment difficult. Sparse data\nnetworks and spatial heterogeneity of meteorologic\nconditions can make a mockery of claims for high con-\nfidence in \u2018observed\u2019 values. Comparison of individual\nforecast techniques is complicated by differences\namong model formulations. For example, because\neach model used unique terrain descriptions that could\nbe vastly different, forecasted temperatures referred to\ndifferent locations and elevations. Finally, constantly\nevolving model formulations suggest that evaluations\ncan become outdated quickly. \nClimate-forecast evaluations have periodically ap-\npeared in the scientific literature (Bettge et al. 1981,\nPriesendorfer & Mobley 1984, Livezey 1990, Murphy\n& Huang 1991, Livezey et al. 1997). However, with\nsome exceptions (e.g. Lehman 1987, Mjelde et al.\n1993) the evaluations were framed for researchers\nand forecasters rather than users, and did not distin-\nguish among regions within the Southwest; others\nsupported internal operations and were not broadly\ndistributed (e.g. SRP 1998). CPC outlooks posted on\nthe Web included maps of skill for some forecast\ntechniques, but they were cryptic, offered no inter-\npretive information, and reviewed what constituted\nonly partial input to final forecasts. The latter limita-\ntion exists for any evaluation focused only on a single\ntechnique (e.g. Unger 1996a,b, Peng et al. 2000). CPC\nalso provided quantitative evaluations of each official\nforecast on their Web site, but results reflected condi-\ntions across the entire conterminous US, without\nregional breakdowns. Reviews of overall climate out-\nlook performance designed for the general public\n(CPC 1995, WRCC 1998) described elements of\nexpected performance in the Southwest, but lacked\nquantitative assessments. Goddard et al. (2000)\nreviewed climate-forecasting capabilities, although\nthe techniques were not associated with specific fore-\ncast providers or products. Other evaluations\naddressed forecast performance only for short peri-\nods, e.g. during the 1997-98 El Ni\u00f1o event (Leetma\n1998, Barnston et al. 1999, Mason et al. 1999, Office\nof Global Programs 1999, Pagano et al. 1999). \nAs long-term forecasts, climate outlooks pose special\ndifficulties for quantitative evaluation. First, climate\noutlooks concern only average temperatures and total\nprecipitation over an entire forecast period. They say\nnothing about daily, weekly, or even monthly extremes\nwithin a 3 mo forecast period or whether precipitation\nwill occur as many small or a few large events. How-\never, in the semi-arid Southwest, seasonal precipita-\ntion can be defined by a single event, such as Hurri-\ncane Nora in 1997 (Pagano et al. 1999). Second, limited\nsamples compromise even the most mathematically\nrigorous analyses. Spatial and temporal autocorrela-\ntion reduces effective sample sizes further, while fore-\ncast technology changes faster than sufficient data can\naccumulate. \nThe hydrologic community does not have a strong\ntradition of evaluating operational forecasts. Workshop\nparticipants recalled failed efforts in the late 1970s to\ncompare operational performance of hydrologic mod-\nels and forecasts. Conflict arose over which basins,\ndata sets, evaluation periods, and techniques to use.\n252\nHartmann et al.: Weather, climate, and hydrologic forecasting for the US Southwest\nThe overall sense was that hydrologists and their insti-\ntutions had too much at stake, professionally and\nfinancially, to risk the possibility of their techniques\nbeing proven inferior to others in a head-to-head com-\nparison. Thus, most evaluations have focused on alter-\nnative techniques (e.g. McCuen et al. 1979), not opera-\ntional products. \nSeasonal water supply outlooks inherently provide\nsome evaluation information, through the various\nexceedance quantiles, because they are based on the\nstandard error of regression calibration. In addition,\nthe CBRFC and NRCS provided annual reviews of the\npast season\u2019s outlooks and actual conditions (e.g.\nCBRFC 1991), although without addressing perfor-\nmance over more extended periods. The most recent\nevaluation of operational hydrologic forecasts dealt\nwith seasonal outlooks issued through 1980 (Shafer &\nHuddleston 1984), using simple statistics (e.g. error\nand bias) and treating the 50% exceedance forecasts\nas deterministic, not probabilistic, values. NWS has\ndeveloped procedures for evaluating experimental\nESP forecasts (Perica 1998), but no assessments had\nbeen completed for Southwest watersheds during the\nsurvey period. Comprehensive evaluations of historic\nhydrologic forecasts are limited by lack of computer-\nized data and documentation of model details (e.g.\nchanges in the regression equations). For seasonal-\nscale forecasts, potential assessments are also limited\nby small effective sample sizes, because few outlooks\nare issued each year and there is high correlation\namong conditions within a season.\n6.7. The future of forecasting\nThe evolution of computer power and remote sens-\ning of oceanic, atmospheric, and land conditions have\nproduced significant shifts in the philosophy and prac-\ntice of weather and climate forecasting, although not\nyet for hydrologic forecasting. The meteorologic fore-\ncasting community incorporated spatially variable\napproaches to dynamic conceptual modeling, while\nconceptual hydrologic models were still lumped appli-\ncations, treating large regions as a single homoge-\nneous unit. While the availability of geographic\ninformation systems, digital models of terrain charac-\nteristics, and satellite remote sensing fostered substan-\ntial research to develop distributed hydrologic models,\nthe models were far from being used operationally. \nResearch focused on interactions among oceanic,\natmospheric, and land systems has resulted in the\nincorporation of limited coupling into operational fore-\ncasts. In particular, SSTs over the Pacific Ocean were\nused in several GCMs to affect climate forecasts over\ncontinental areas, and ENSO phenomena were incor-\nporated into some statistical equations forecasting\nwater supply in the Southwest. However, other large-\nscale phenomena (e.g. Pacific North American and\nSouthwest trough circulation patterns and the Pacific\nDecadal Oscillation), while recognized as having\nimportant consequences for Southwest hydroclimatol-\nogy (Cayan & Peterson 1989, Redmond & Koch 1991,\nCayan 1996, Woodhouse 1997), were incorporated into\noperational forecasts in very limited ways or not at all. \nSome nested models were being used for weather\nforecasts, but many alternative implementations re-\nmained to be explored (e.g. using 1-way or 2-way\nfeedbacks between nested models or nesting with\nmore than 2 tiers of models). Nesting of models with\ndifferent spatial coverage and resolution is wrought\nwith complexities related to appropriate linkages of\nprocesses and other issues. In contrast, temporal nest-\ning is conceptually straightforward, but was largely\nneglected by forecast operations during the survey\nperiod. While operational forecasts were made for time\nscales ranging from minutes to several months, there\nwere no explicit connections between them. Further,\nwhile forecasters generally recognized that the accu-\nmulation of short-term forecasts should be consistent\nwith longer-term forecasts, both production and evalu-\nation of forecasts generally neglected nested time\nintervals.\nA reasonable vision of forecasting over the extended\nfuture is for increasing complexity and interconnectiv-\nity of all phases of modeling. A forecast system of the\nfuture might be expected to include incorporation of a\ngreater variety of data; coupling between oceanic,\natmospheric, and hydrologic processes; nesting across\nmultiple spatial and temporal scales; and updating of\nforecasts by assimilation of recent observational data.\nFurther, the future of forecasting is likely to include a\nlarger number of techniques, both statistical and\ndynamical, empirical and conceptual. The best means\nfor integrating and communicating diverse forecasts\nwill likely become an increasingly important issue for\nboth forecasters and forecast users. \nLarge research programs, with joint participation by\nmany research groups, are focused on developing the\nnext generation of forecast tools. However, based on\nthe slow rate of transition of research into hydrologic\noperations, it is likely to be many years before the\nresearch programs will result in new operational\nhydrologic forecasts. Theoretically, there are signifi-\ncant opportunities for relatively rapid improvement of\noperational hydrologic forecasts based on recent\nimprovements in climate-forecast skill. However,\nbecause hydrologic research programs are generally\ndevoted to the next generation of forecast tools and\nexclude current operational techniques, those oppor-\ntunities have not yet been realized. \n253\nClim Res 21: 239\u2013258, 2002\n7. RECOMMENDATIONS\nReview of the weather, climate, and hydrologic fore-\ncasts available for the Southwest, along with institu-\ntional considerations, suggests a range of opportunities\nfor improving the production, delivery, and use of fore-\ncast products. The following recommendations require\ninterdisciplinary collaboration, not just between the\nphysical science research community and operational\nforecasters, but with current and potential forecast\nusers and social scientists as well. \n7.1. Product content and communication\nQualitative aspects can be as important as any quan-\ntitative attribute in affecting how users interpret,\napply, and ultimately judge forecast products (Nicholls\n1999). This survey revealed a wide array of methods\nand formats used to communicate forecasts. Discus-\nsions with study participants revealed that even those\nwith technical backgrounds were consistently misin-\nterpreting some products. Surveys, structured discus-\nsions, and other innovative approaches (Stern & East-\nerling 1999) should be used to comprehensively assess\nforecast qualities and influence development of prod-\nucts that foster easy, accurate, and reliable interpreta-\ntion. Among the issues that should be addressed are\nthe following: \n\u2022 visualization of forecasts, both spatial (e.g. climate\noutlooks) and temporal (e.g. water supply outlooks);\n\u2022 communication of probabilistic forecasts in ways that\npresent likelihoods across entire distributions and\nrelative to base probabilities (e.g. IRI climate fore-\ncasts and water supply outlooks);\n\u2022 presentation of ancillary information (e.g. text dis-\ncussions, historic data, and local climatologic distrib-\nutions); and \n\u2022 designation of forecasts as official, operational,\nexperimental, or research products. \nFurther, while potential users had opportunities to\naccess a variety of products, there was little supporting\ninformation to help them choose which products would\nbe most appropriate for their specific needs. Decision\nmakers should be encouraged to establish ongoing\nrelationships with forecast providers, particularly\nWFOs. The complexity of some products and the diver-\nsity of potential users suggest an intermediary role for\nother organizations as well, as translators and advisors\nand to develop more useable products. Toward that\nend, efforts should focus on how specific products are\nused and establishing priorities for fulfilling users\u2019\nneeds for new products. During the 1997-98 El Ni\u00f1o\nevent, Pagano et al. (1999) assessed decision makers\u2019\nuse of hydroclimatic forecasts in the context of antici-\npated water surplus in the Southwest. Needed still,\nhowever, are similar studies conducted during La Nina\nconditions to address slowly developing drought con-\nditions lacking easy action options. \nFinally, this 2 yr survey provides only a panoramic\nsnapshot of forecasts available for the Southwest.\nSince the end of the study period, new forecast prod-\nucts and providers have emerged on the scene, e.g.\nexcessive heat outlooks issued by the CPC. In another\ncase, a private company began selling attractive, but\nincorrect, reinterpretations of CPC climate outlooks.\nAdditional surveys should be repeated periodically to\nassess the evolution of forecast products and their\ndelivery.\n7.2. Modeling capabilities\nLarge ongoing programs in atmospheric and hydro-\nlogic research make clear that current modeling capa-\nbilities do not provide sufficient predictive capabilities\nfor many conditions and purposes. In the Southwest,\nwhere global- and continental-scale climate processes\nmay sometimes be less significant than regional land\nsurface-atmosphere interactions, regional climate\nmodels would be useful for downscaling climate out-\nlooks or increasing the frequency of non-climatology\nclimate forecasts, especially for the summer monsoon\nseason. The modeling recommendation rated highest\nat the forecast assessment workshop called for more\neffectively incorporating climate forecasts, and their\nvariable quality, into statistical water supply outlooks.\nAdditionally, studies should evaluate the potential for\nfrequent areal measurements of snow conditions (e.g.\nfrom the NWS National Operational Hydrology Re-\nmote Sensing Center) to improve hydrologic forecasts\nusing operational statistical and conceptual models.\n7.3. Forecast evaluation\nOrganizations that make forecasts publicly available\nshould also provide publicly available evaluations of\nforecast performance. Assessments of historic forecasts\nprovide users with a quantitative basis for forecast\ncredibility and can demonstrate product improvement\nover time, enhancing the potential for decision makers\nto respond appropriately to both anomalies and fore-\ncasts of their occurrence (Sarewitz et al. 2000). How-\never, this survey found that forecasts were rarely\naccompanied by clear quantitative assessments of past\nperformance. Recent evaluations of CPC climate out-\nlooks, completed subsequent to the survey period\n(Wilks 2000, Hartmann et al. 2002), represent impor-\ntant progress but are not accessible to general users\n254\nHartmann et al.: Weather, climate, and hydrologic forecasting for the US Southwest\nwhen they acquire forecasts. From a user\u2019s perspec-\ntive, a better alternative would be an interactive Web\nsite that allows users to evaluate past forecasts that\ncover the periods and lead times relevant to their situ-\nation, using multiple forecast performance measures\nthat reflect their sensitivity to different forecast quali-\nties. \nFor operational forecasters, frequently updated eval-\nuations can help in calibrating the uncertainty they\nattribute to a final product. For the research commu-\nnity, evaluations can identify situations where fore-\ncasts have been consistently inaccurate, suggesting\nunique situations and potential model improvements.\nHindcasts, whereby predictions are made of the past in\na simulated operational setting, are useful for individ-\nual forecast techniques, but less so for products that\nincorporate forecaster subjectivity. However, hindcasts\ncould effectively assess the objective criteria for\nassigning climatologic probabilities in the CPC out-\nlooks, as well as hydrologic forecasts made using ESP\nor statistical regressions. \nFinally, forecasters and the research community\nshould jointly establish an archive of operational prod-\nucts and ancillary information. The NWS Surface\nRecords Retention System stores all NWS products\nissued through their official channels, but it was\ndesigned for accessing forecasts related to specific\nevents, has high retrieval costs, and was uniformly\nseen by NWS personnel as ineffective for extracting\nhypertemporal records. However, the transient nature\nof many forecasts and the lack of archived details\nabout their production preclude evaluation across a\nbroad range of products. Without periodically updated\nevaluations that are accessible to users, the scientific\nand forecasting communities risk that inevitable fail-\nures of specific forecasts will engender persistent\nskepticism, even as scientific understanding and fore-\ncast techniques improve.\nAcknowledgements.
