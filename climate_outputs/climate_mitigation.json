The research and the \neducators were a part of two USDA-NIFA climate \nprojects,1 which were funded to increase Corn \nBelt agriculture\u2019s capacity to adapt to and to assist \nin mitigating the impacts of climate change. \nThese lessons give us a deeper understanding \nof the beliefs and knowledge of agricultural \nstakeholders at the intersection of climate and \nagriculture. They provide insights into farmers\u2019 \nreadiness to learn about climate science and to \nengage in adaptive and mitigative agricultural \nmanagement. \nIn addition, extension educators\u2019 experiences \nin these projects offer a valuable foundation \nfrom which to expand university extension and \noutreach capacities within states and across the \nregion to address nitrogen management, build \nand improve soil resources, manage flooding, \nhandle drought and water resource limitations, \nimprove crop productivity, and manage the \nvariety of challenges and opportunities associated \nwith the impacts of climate change on corn-based \nagricultural systems.\nKey social science recommendations:\n1.   Farmers have a great deal of experience with \nvariability in weather and many are confident in \ntheir capacity to deal with increasing variability. \nEngagement strategies that appeal to farmers\u2019 \nconfidence and capacity to adapt are likely to \nattract and increase their interest.\n2.   Successful use of adaptive management tools \nand practices requires science- and experience-\nbased knowledge. Farm advisers reported that \nthey trust \u201cUniversity extension as a source of \nclimate information,\u201d suggesting that extension \neducators can play a role in changing attitudes \nand motivating adaptive management of \nagriculture and natural resources.\n3.   Because many farmers do not believe that \nhumans are the primary cause of climate change, \ndirect outreach (e.g., meetings and workshops) \nto farmers and advisers may be more effective \nwhen the message focuses not on climate change, \nbut instead on agricultural vulnerabilities to \nincreased weather variability and extreme \nweather, and adaptive management strategies.\n4.   Conversations about soil health and \nerosion control are ways to introduce adaptive \nmanagement strategies that can provide field, \nfarm, and watershed level benefits. These topics \ninterest all farmers, including the sixty percent \nof north central region farmers who are either \nuncertain or do not agree with the science on \nclimate change. \nclimate change and \nAgricultural extension\niv\nBuilding capacity for land grant university extension \nservices to address the agricultural impacts of \nclimate change and adaptive management needs of \nagricultural stakeholders\nExecutive Summary\nExtension and outreach educators \nidentified needs that would help \nthem be more effective in their \nprogramming:\n1.   Timely receipt of university climate and \nagricultural science, in accessible language that \ncan be shared with extension educator audiences.\n2.   Opportunities for formal and informal \nscience and knowledge exchanges among \nuniversity scientists and Extension and Outreach \neducators.\n3.   Opportunities to communicate with and \nbuild relationships with state and university \nclimatologists.\n4.   Opportunities and/or mechanisms to involve \nextension and outreach educators in defining \nresearch questions that make science more useful \nto stakeholders.\n5.   Increased communication among field staff \nand state specialists.\n6.   More audience-specific tools, products, \neducational materials, media, and on-line \nresources.\n7.   Effective ways to incorporate climate \nmaterials into agricultural programming.\nInstitutional support:\nLand grant university (LGU) extension services \nreach a wide variety of stakeholders with \ndiverse needs. These stakeholders often have \ndiffering and sometimes conflicting priorities \nthat make extension and outreach programming \na challenge. Extension, in general, has not yet \ndeveloped a coordinated effort to identify priority \ninvestments at the intersection of climate and \nagriculture at state and regional levels. There is \na need for more research and meta-analysis that \nsynthesizes and translates vast and complicated \nresearch results into information that extension \nand outreach educators can use to educate \nagricultural stakeholders. \nInstitutional observations and \nsuggested action items to increase \nthe effectiveness and relevance of \nNCR LGU extension and outreach \nprograms:\n1.   Commitment to climate change adaptation \nand mitigation in agriculture must be strongly \nsignaled at all levels of the LGU extension system. \nUSDA is providing a consistent message that \nthe nation must act to adapt to climate change \nand reduce emissions of heat-trapping gases. \nExtension should match that message.\n2.   Purposefully and systematically work to \nensure that extension and outreach educators are \nconsistently exposed to locally-relevant science \non climate change and agriculture. \n3.   Generate science that answers critical \nquestions for agriculture, and put the science in \nusable formats and language that enhances the \nability of extension and outreach educators to \nconvey the science.\n4.   Strengthen internal partnerships. University \nscientists should be proactive in sharing the \nscience with extension and other university staff, \nwho have outreach responsibilities, in a timely \nand accessible way.\n5.   Identify a state climate coordinator to \nfacilitate exchanges within and outside of the \nuniversity by linking individuals and programs. \nsss\nClimate Change and Agricultural Extension s v\n1The North Central region land grant \nuniversities have a unique opportunity to \nleverage the initial capacity building begun \nby these two projects, to build out a robust, \nregionally coordinated extension program. \nClimate Change and Agricultural Extension s 2\nclimate change and \nAgricultural extension\nBuilding capacity for land grant university extension services to address the agricultural \nimpacts of climate change and adaptive management needs of agricultural stakeholders\nThe United States Department of Agriculture-National Institute for Food and Agriculture \n(USDA NIFA) funded two climate and \nagriculture grants (2011-2016), Sustainable Corn \nCoordinated Agricultural Project (CAP)2 and \nUseful to Usable (U2U),3 to increase Corn Belt \nagriculture\u2019s capacity to adapt to and to assist in \nmitigating the impacts of climate change. \nDuring the last five years, the Sustainable \nCorn CAP and U2U project have utilized their \nresearch-extension investments to expand agro-\nclimate science and to strengthen the research-\nextension linkages throughout the north central \n(NC) region of the United States. \nThe Sustainable Corn CAP multi-disciplinary \nteam of 140 scientists collected measurements \nat 35 field sites, in eight NC states, and entered \nall data into a centralized database. Researchers \nanalyzed, modeled, and interpreted the data to \nbetter understand how drainage, cover crops, \ntillage, fertilizers and crop rotations affect water, \ncarbon and nitrogen cycles under variable \nweather conditions. \nConcurrent with the field trials, social scientists \nin the Sustainable Corn CAP and U2U projects \ngathered data from Corn Belt farmers, crop \nadvisers, and climatologists. The data provided \ninsights about perceptions of risk, vulnerabilities, \nand opportunities associated with increasingly \nvariable weather and climate, and were used to \ninform engagement with farmers and agricultural \nadvisors. \nScientific findings have been reported in \n163 refereed journal articles, 213 extension \npublications and 1108 presentations to \nstakeholders, resulting in a total audience reach \nof 97,477. Many of the instructional videos, facts \nsheets and other publications can be found at \nuniversity extension online stores. (See http://\nstore.extension.iastate.edu/Topic/Crops/Climate-\nand-Agriculture.) \nThe 50-member interdisciplinary U2U team \ndeveloped five climate-based decision support \ntools, available online at https://mygeohub.\norg/groups/u2u/tools. Based on intensive \nstakeholder input, the tools are aimed at helping \nfarmers adapt to changing climate conditions. In \naddition, the team produced over 50 journal and \nextension publications, provided the agricultural \ncommunity with over 140 training events, and \nreceived national and local recognitions for \nsuccess in research and extension integration.\nThe work of these complementary projects \nbrought increased understanding of carbon, \nnitrogen, and water cycles in corn-based systems \nand responses to management practices under \ndifferent climate scenarios; enhanced the \nusability and up-take of climate information; and \nbolstered extension\u2019s capacity to address agro-\nclimate concerns and support more resilient and \nIntroduction\nprofitable agricultural systems in a changing \nclimate. Though the five-year Sustainable \nCorn CAP and U2U projects are coming to a \nclose, many of the principal investigators will \ncontinue to utilize project databases and develop \nrecommendations for field, watershed, and \nregional decision making.\nWhen these projects started in 2011, few \nextension educators across the region provided \nprogramming focused on helping Corn Belt \nfarmers identify and implement management \nstrategies in response to extreme weather events, \nshort-term climate variability, and long-term \nclimate change. Even fewer were helping farmers \nidentify potential climate mitigation strategies. \nFor five years, the Sustainable Corn CAP engaged \nand partially funded 18 extension educators \nand outreach watershed coordinators, in the \nNC region, to build capacity for extension and \noutreach efforts that address climate change \nand its impacts on corn production systems. \nThe integration of social, climate, hydrological \nand agronomic sciences 1) increased educators\u2019 \nknowledge about climate science and applications \nto agriculture;  2) involved educators in the \nassessment of farmers\u2019 awareness, knowledge, \nand current responses to extreme weather and \nvariable climate conditions to guide extension of \nscientific findings to stakeholders; and 3) engaged \na small cohort (~140) of conservation-oriented \nfarmers in learning about climate science and \nproject-related agricultural adaptive management \npractices. \nThe U2U project developed decision support \ntools and educational resources that continue \nto be refined based on direct feedback gathered \nfrom farmers, advisers, the Sustainable Corn \nCAP extension and outreach educators, and \nother experts. \nThe capacity-building and knowledge-transfer \nactivities of both projects were uniquely different, \nbut complementary. They had common goals \nof integrating agro-climate knowledge into \nextension and outreach plans of work and the \npilot testing of adaptive management tools \nand strategies with farmers to help them better \nrespond to current and projected climate changes \nacross the region. These efforts complemented \nexisting extension endeavors and strengthened \nthe reputation of Extension as a leader in \nprogramming focused on climate resilient \nagriculture.\n3\nClimate Change and Agricultural Extension s 4\nFIGURE 1  |  Percent of \nIncrease in Amounts of \nVery Heavy Precipitation \nevents from 1958 to 2012. \nFigure obtained online Feb. \n29, 2016, from the U.S. Global \nChange Research Program: \nnca2014.globalchange.\ngov./report/our-changing-\nclimate/heavy-downpours-\nincreasing#tab2-images.  \nlessons give us a deeper understanding of \nthe beliefs and knowledge of agricultural \nstakeholders at the intersection of climate \nand agriculture. They provide insights into \nstakeholder readiness to learn about climate \nscience and engage in adaptive management. \nKnowing and understanding the current capacity \nof educators and stakeholders to act on the \nscience and their own knowledge can improve \nadaptive management responses. \nLessons learned from social science findings \nare presented first, followed by extension and \noutreach educators\u2019 self-assessment of the \nchallenges of talking about climate science and \nagriculture with stakeholders, how to frame \neducational messages, and tips on moving their \nagricultural audiences to adaptive management \nsolutions. This paper identifies structural and \ninstitutional challenges of developing learning \nenvironments and the iterative exchange of \nagriculture and climate knowledge. Lastly, \nrecommendations for extension and outreach \nefforts that address adaptive management \nsolutions for agriculture in the NC region are \noffered.\nsss\nWhile these two USDA projects were term-\nlimited grants, the need for agro-climate \nextension and outreach grows. The United States \nThird National Climate Assessment (2014)4  \nand supporting reports5 not only document \nthat climate disruptions to agriculture have \nbeen increasing over the past 50 years, but also \nproject a rising incidence of weather extremes. \nThe map above (Figure 1), for example, shows \nlarge increases in heavy precipitation events have \noccurred in the Northeast, Midwest, and Great \nPlains. Heavy downpours have frequently led \nto runoff that exceeded the capacity of storm \ndrains and levees, caused flooding events and \naccelerated erosion. Extreme weather events \nwill increasingly impact crop and livestock \nproductivity and substantive degradation of \nsoil and water resources. The NC region land \ngrant universities have a unique opportunity to \nto leverage the initial capacity building begun \nby these two projects, to build out a robust, \nregionally coordinated extension program. \nIn this paper we document the lessons learned \nfrom 1) the social science of these projects and \n2) the experiences of Extension and outreach \neducators involved with these projects. These \n5PART 1\nA key message of the U.S. Third National Climate Assessment report6 is that climate \nchange poses threats to agriculture and will \nrequire adaptation and mitigation by farmers. \nHowever, very little research about farmers\u2019 and \nagricultural advisers\u2019 perspectives on climate \nchange had been conducted prior to 2011. The \nsocial scientists in the Sustainable Corn CAP \nand U2U projects recognized that transfer of \nuniversity science and effective interventions \nrequired deeper understanding of current \nagricultural practices, beliefs and attitudes \nabout climate change, and the willingness and \ncapacities of stakeholders to change behaviors. To \nobtain insights into their perceptions regarding \nthese topics, the scientists conducted surveys, \ninterviews, focus groups, and an analysis of media \nmessages in agricultural trade publications.\nThe social scientists asked a number of basic \nresearch questions: What do farmers and \ntheir advisers believe about climate change? \nAre they concerned about increasing weather \nvariability? What climate impacts are of most \nconcern and present significant risks to the farm \nenterprise? Do they support action (adaptation \nand/or mitigation) and by whom? Do farmers \nthink they should change the way they farm? \nWho influences farmers in their management \ndecisions? Do they think that universities, farm \ngroups, and government agencies should help? \nWhat types of climate information are farmers \nusing to make decisions?\nSpecifically, data were gathered using quantitative \nand qualitative research methods including a \nspring 2012 mail survey of 4,778 farmers from \nacross the Corn Belt,7 159 in-depth interviews \nwith farmers from 9 states, longitudinal on-\nline surveys of advisers in 20128 (n=2087) and \n20139 (n=864), 12 focus groups (July 2012 \u2013 \nDec 2013), 57 in-depth interviews with public \nand private advisers, and an archival analysis \nof media messages in 1000 articles from news \noutlets and ag-related trade publications (April \n1, 2012-March 31, 2014). The Corn Belt farmer \nsurvey sampled larger-scale farmers (at least \n80 acres of corn and $100,000 in gross farm \nincome), in 22 HUC 6 watersheds representing \nabout 80 percent of farmland in the NC region. \nDescriptive data and maps of the region are \npublished in two farmer statistical atlases, which \nLessons Learned from Sustainable Corn CAP \nand U2U \nSOCIAL SCIENCE\nClimate Change and Agricultural Extension s 6\ncan be found at: http://store.extension.iastate.\nedu/Topic/Crops/Climate-and-Agriculture. A \nbibliography of published findings from this \nresearch to-date is listed in Appendix A.\nKey findings from the Social Science \nResearch\n(Endnotes indicate references in which specific \nfindings are published.)\nWhat do we know about Corn Belt farmers\u2019 \nand agricultural advisers\u2019 perspectives on \nclimate change?\nBeliefs, concerns and perceptions\n1.   Most farmers (66 percent) believe that climate \nchange is occurring. About 8 percent attribute \nclimate change primarily to human activity, 33 \npercent to both human and natural causes, and \n25 percent to mostly natural causes.10   \n2.   Many farmers and advisers are concerned \nabout the predicted impacts of climate change. \nHalf or more are concerned or very concerned \nabout drought, heat, pests, disease, and extreme \nprecipitation.11 12 13\n3.   Climate change beliefs are related to perceived \nrisks.14 Farmers who believe climate change is \nhappening and due at least in part to human \nactivity are more concerned about impacts and \nare much more supportive of both adaptation \nand mitigation actions. For example, two-thirds \nof farmers who believe that climate change is \nhappening and due primarily to human activity \nindicate they are concerned or very concerned \nabout longer dry periods or drought in the \nfuture, compared to 47 percent of farmers who \ndo not believe that climate change is occurring.15  \n4.   Beliefs, perceived risks, confidence, attitudes, \nand current practices vary widely across the NC \nregion.16\n5.   Climate change beliefs vary by group.17 \nFarmers, crop advisers and extension educators\u2019 \nbeliefs align more closely to one another than to \nuniversity scientists and state climatologists.18\n6.   Among the former groups, half or fewer \nbelieve that climate change is occurring and due \nsubstantially to human activity, compared to \nbetween 80-90 percent for the latter groups.19 \n7.   Climate change beliefs can shift over time. \nSurveys of Iowa farmers found that between \n2011 and 2013, 48 percent changed belief \nposition, with 31 percent moving toward belief \nin anthropogenic climate change, and 17 percent \ntoward uncertainty or non-belief in climate \nchange.  However, agricultural advisers showed \nno significant change in climate change belief \nbetween the times they were surveyed in 2012 \nand 2013.20\nAdaptation and Mitigation\n8.   Most \nfarmer survey \nrespondents (66 \npercent) agree that \nfarmers in general \nshould take \nadditional steps to \nprotect land from \nincreased weather \nvariability.21\n9.   Climate \nchange beliefs are \nrelated to support \nfor adaptation \nand mitigation. \nFarmers who \nbelieve climate change is happening and \ndue at least in part to human activity are \nmore concerned about impacts and are more \nsupportive of both adaptation and mitigation \nactions. For example, 80 percent of farmers who \nbelieve that climate change is occurring and \ndue mostly to human activity agree that farmers \nshould take additional action to protect their land \nfrom increased weather variability, compared to \n45 percent of farmers who do not believe that \nclimate change is occurring. The correlation is \nstronger for mitigation: 60 percent of farmers \nwho believe in anthropogenic climate change \nsupport government action to reduce greenhouse \ngas emissions, compared to 15 percent of farmers \nColo,\nIowa\nMarch \n2013\n7who believe that climate change is due mostly to \nnatural causes.22 Most advisers surveyed agree \nthat farmers will need to change practices to \ncope with more variable weather and climate \nconditions. However, advisers\u2019 willingness and \nconfidence in using climate information in their \ncrop related advice is lacking.23 \n10.   Advisers\u2019 attitudes toward adaptation are \nalso closely related to climate change beliefs. \nThose advisers who agree that climate change \nis at least partly caused by human activities \nreport stronger agreement that adaptation is \nimportant.24 \n11.   Seventy-three percent of extension educators \nsurveyed agree or strongly agree they should help \nfarmers to prepare for the impacts of increased \nweather variability, while \n20 percent are uncertain if \nthey should help.25 \n12.   Many farmers support \npublic and private sector \naction to help them \nadapt. For example, 84 \npercent agree that \u201cseed \ncompanies should develop \ncrop varieties adapted \nto increased weather \nvariability,\u201d and 62 percent \nagree that \u201cuniversity \nextension should help \nfarmers to prepare \nfor increased weather \nvariability.\u201d26\n13.   Farmers are generally \nconfident in their capacity \nto adapt to increased \nweather variability, but \nmany report uncertainty.27\n14.   Farmers are already adapting to increases in \nwarm season precipitation by selectively using \na combination of no-till/reduced tillage, cover \ncrops, tile drainage and increasing planting to \nhighly erodible lands based on their geographic \nlocation and on-farm experiences.28\n15.   Some farmers are taking adaptive actions \nthat can have positive short-term impacts on \nyields (e.g., increased spring tillage or increased \ntile drainage) but which may undermine long-\nterm soil and water resource integrity.29\nInstitutions \n16.   For Corn Belt agricultural advisers, \nextension and university scientists are trusted \nsources of information on climate change. 30 31 \n17.   Results from a study of Iowa farmers \nindicates that university scientists are their \nmost trusted sources of information on climate \nchange.32   \n18.   For general decisions about agricultural \npractices and strategies, farmer survey \nrespondents indicate that private sector actors \nsuch as seed dealers and agricultural chemical \ndealers are most influential.33 34 35 36  \n19.   Advisers are an untapped resource that \ncan potentially help increase the use of weather \nand climate information in ag-related decision \nmaking.37 Agronomic and conservation advisers \nshow promising interest in and ability to use \nclimate information in their day-to-day advice, \nwhile financial advisers are less interested.38\n20.

Advisers may be more or less inclined to \nprovide climate information, depending on \nthe presence or lack of a) institutional support \nand collaboration, b) advisee focus on long-\nterm climate risk versus short-term risk, and \nc) in the case of advisers who are employed at \nfor-profit businesses, climate information that \ncontraindicates a product or program of their \nbusiness.40\n \nRecommendations from Social Science \nFindings\nCommunicating the science \n1.   Climate scientists and extension educators \nmay be more effective if they tailor their messages \nin ways that reduce threats to individual \nviewpoints and increase dialogue among those \nwith differing views.\n2.   Because many farmers do not believe that \nhumans are the primary cause of climate change, \ndirect outreach (e.g., meetings and workshops) to \nfarmers and advisers may be more effective when \nthe message focuses on adapting to increased \nweather variability, extreme weather, agricultural \nvulnerability, and related risks. This suggests \nlimiting discussion of the causes of climate \nchange, which are less relevant to changing farm \npractices and more likely to alienate audiences. \n3.   Because many farmers and advisers do not \ncurrently believe the scientific consensus on \nanthropogenic climate change, over the long \nterm it is important to develop strategies to \ncommunicate a) the science of climate change \nand its current and predicted impacts and b) the \nrelevance and urgency of adaptive and mitigative \nactions. \n4.   Similar to other large-scale, diffused problems \nlike non-point source water pollution, focusing \non specific actions that farmers and advisers can \ntake will be an important part of communication \nstrategies.\n5.   Outreach strategies should take into account \nthat farmers and advisers, like anyone else, can \nchange their perspectives on things as they \nlearn from new experiences and information. \nExtension should continue to incorporate \nscience-based information on climate change, its \npotential impacts, and adaptation and mitigation \nstrategies into programming for farmers and \nadvisers.\n6.   Research suggests that extension is a trusted \nsource of information to advisers and farmers \nabout climate change. Thus, extension is uniquely \npositioned to help the agricultural sector increase \nclimate adaptive capacity and the resilience of \ncorn-based cropping systems, and to explore \nagricultural practices which can contribute to \nmitigating greenhouse gases (GHGs). \n7.   Farmers are more supportive of adaption \nto increase resilience than they are of GHG \nmitigation. Therefore, emphasizing the resilience-\nenhancing benefits of farm practices that may \nalso have GHG-reducing properties (cover crops, \nreduced tillage, extended rotations, and nitrogen \nmanagement), rather than the climate-change \nmitigative aspects of the practices, is advisable.\n8.   Because farmers\u2019 perspectives and \nbehaviors vary across the Corn Belt region, \nalign engagement and outreach programs and \nmaterials with local conditions and contexts.\n9Encouraging adaptive management\n9.   Develop strategies to help extension and \nprivate sector advisers better understand the \nscience on climate change and to recognize \nthat farmers need to take adaptive (and \nmitigative) actions to ensure sustainability of \nagroecosystems. \n10.   Successful use of adaptive management tools \nand practices require science- and experience-\nbased knowledge. Farmers and advisers trust \nextension, suggesting that extension can play \na role in changing attitudes and motivating \nadaptive management of agricultural and natural \nresources.\n11.   Farmers have a great deal of experience with \nvariability in weather and many are confident in \ntheir capacity to deal with increased variability. \nEngagement strategies that appeal to confidence \nand capacity to adapt are likely to increase \nstakeholder interest. \n12.   Encourage farmers to use and experiment \nwith a combination of practices and customize \nmanagement to their own field and farm \nconditions, observing how different weather \npatterns affect soil loss, water drainage, and \nproductivity. \n13.   Encourage cropping practices that reduce \nsoil erosion and enhance productivity. More \ntimely and accurate local weather/climate \ninformation would help farmers make better \nmanagement decisions. Decision support tools \ncan help farmers improve their management \ntrade-off decisions in selecting a particular \ncombination of practices that ensure protection \nof their soil and water resources under different \nweather conditions.\n14.   Conversations about soil health and erosion \ncontrol are ways to introduce management \nstrategies for adaptation. These are themes that \ncould help the 60 percent of NC region farmers \nwho are either uncertain or do not agree with the \nscience on climate change to implement adaptive \nactions that provide field, farm, and watershed \nlevel benefits.\n15.   Because most farmers 1) believe that they \nshould take steps to protect their land and 2) \nsupport efforts by private and public advisers \nto help them adapt, this points to opportunities \nfor advisers to increase efforts to promote \nappropriate adaptive (and mitigative) actions. \nInstitutional Action\n16.   Capitalize on extension\u2019s role as a trusted \nprovider of climate change information. Integrate \ninformation about climate change impacts and \nthe need for adaptation into programming for \nboth farmers and advisers. Extension is uniquely \npositioned to help the agricultural sector to \nimprove resilience and adaptive capacity and to \naddress GHG mitigation.\n17.   Broaden the conversations related to \nclimate change, mitigation, and adaptation to \ninclude business and agricultural advisers (e.g., \nagricultural retailers, custom operators, financial \nAgricultural Extension for the 21st Century s10\nadvisers). Understand the roles that different \ntypes of advisers play in agricultural decision \nmaking and engage each appropriately.\n18.   Ensure extension faculty and staff across \nprogram areas and at all organizational levels \nincorporate adaptation and mitigation into \nexisting programming. These programs are \nalready designed to address farmer and adviser \ndecision-making needs and, therefore, provide \nexcellent communication pathways. \n19.   Extension administration should \ncommunicate to field staff the urgency of \nunderstanding climate science and the range of \nadaptive actions that can increase the resilience \nof agricultural systems.\n20.   Continue adapting climate information \nto address farmer and farm adviser decision-\nmaking. While substantial progress has been \nmade in this area, more bridging among climate, \nagriculture, and natural resource disciplines is \nnecessary to make climate information usable.\n21.   Empower agricultural advisers to include \nclimate change adaptation information into the \noperational, tactical, and strategic advice they \nprovide, as appropriate. \n22.   Consider how climate change education \nmight fit into professional development \ntrainings and continuing education credits for \nagricultural professionals and advisers. Improve \nthe knowledge, support and collaboration that \nadvisers have access to in this area.\n23.   Engage the financial advice sector to \nimprove the quality of climate-smart financial \ninformation for BMP decision-making. \n24.   Work with Certified Crop Adviser (CCA) \nboards to include climate science and adaption \nin each state\u2019s performance objectives and in the \ninternational performance objectives. \nsss\n11\nLessons Learned from Sustainable Corn CAP \nand U2U\nEXTENSION AND OUTREACH\nPART 2\nTalking with farmers and crop advisers \nabout climate change and agriculture\nStarting the conversation \nThere is great variation in farmer and agricultural \nadviser views and understanding about climate \nchange and its impacts on agriculture. Knowing \nyour audience is critical to how and where an \neducator starts the conversation. Although two-\nthirds of farmers believe that climate change \nis occurring, only 40 percent implicate human \nactivity. One-third of farmers are uncertain \nwhether it is happening or not. Farmers are more \nwilling to investigate and evaluate solutions to \nchallenges caused by variable weather, than to \ndiscuss causes of climate change or mitigation \nactivities. The setting, language and message \nan educator uses to convey climate science and \nadaptive management information needs to be \ncarefully chosen.\nThe Sustainable Corn CAP extension and outreach educators and social scientists met with the U2U social scientists and outreach team in May 2015. The goal of the meeting was to self-reflect \nand summarize what they had learned about the transfer of climate science, agricultural practices, \nthe facilitation of stakeholder learning, and adaptive management of corn-based cropping systems. \nPrompts for this discussion are in Appendix B. Thirty-four people participated in this three-hour \nconversation. Key lessons learned are summarized below.\nClimate Change and Agricultural Extension s 12\nThe Sustainable Corn CAP extension \neducators. Back row from left: Todd Higgins, \nLincoln University; Charles Ellis, University \nof Missouri; Brian Overstreet, Purdue \nUniversity; Marilyn Thelen, Michigan State \nUniversity; Deana Hudgins, The Ohio State \nUniversity; Laura Edwards, South Dakota \nState University; and Richard Wolkowski, \nUniversity of Wisconsin. Front row from \nleft: Hans Schmitz, Purdue University; Jon \nNeufelder, Purdue University; Chad Ingels, \nIowa State University; and Catherine \nWegehaupt, Heron Lake Watershed District \n(MN). Extension educators not shown: \nRobert Bellm, Dennis Bowman, Russ Higgins \nand Angie Peltier, University of Illinois; \nRichard Hoormann, University of Missouri; \nKerry Netzke and Shawn Wohnoutka, \nRedwood-Cotton Rivers Control Area (MN); \nJan Voit, Heron Lake Watershed District \n(MN).\nTips for successful exchanges\nThe Setting\nHow the conversation begins is affected by the \nsetting in which educators talk with farmers \nabout climate change. Sustainable Corn and U2U \neducators used a variety of settings to encourage \nlearning and information exchange: on-farm \nvisits, small local groups that meet regularly (i.e., \nwatershed groups or neighbor groups), small \ngroups for hands-on skill development with tools \nand data, field days, winter meetings, webinars, \nand conferences. \nOne-on-one\nIn one-on-one situations, educators must first \nestablish their credentials and build trust. \nOne-on-one exchanges allow the educator to \npersonalize the climate science conversation to \nthe farmer\u2019s or crop adviser\u2019s understanding, \nthereby increasing the comfort level to discuss \nclimate (which they may be reluctant to do in \na group setting). This is also an opportunity to \nbuild a relationship that \u201cpermits\u201d the educator \nto bring in climate science that may not be easily \naccepted otherwise.\nGroup events  \nSmall groups are opportunities to have \nconversations about weather variability. Group \nsize and diversity influence how climate science \nis presented and received, and the kind of \nexchanges that occur.\n1.   Group dynamics imply leadership. Someone \nformally or informally directs the initial activities \nand discussion\u2014once one person starts the \nconversation, others build on or challenge the \nideas presented, with some people remaining \nsilent and not contributing. \n2.   Farmer peer-to-peer led groups can mobilize \nfarmers in their watershed or local area to try \nsomething new or re-affirm the status quo (i.e., \nwhat we\u2019re currently doing is enough).\n3.   One person in the group can take the \nconversation to a negative or political place \nunless others censure and shut it down. The \neducator needs to have a plan to re-direct the \ngroup\u2019s conversation back to the science. \n4.   Trust is necessary among farmers in the group \nfor knowledge exchanges to occur with low risk \nto members. \n5.   Each group has different dynamics. Crop \nadvisers seem more likely to ask questions and \nengage the science presented. Large groups seem \nless engaged and less likely to ask questions.\n6.   An offer of Certified Crop Adviser \nContinuing Education Credits encourages \nadvisers to attend meetings that link soil, water, \nweather, and climate. \n7.   Group meetings offer an opportunity to \ndemonstrate U2U and other decision-making \ntools to attract and engage audiences. There \nis strong interest in technology. These tools \nand products provide opportunities to weave \nclimate science and agriculture into management \nconversations and formulate adjustments to on-\nfarm decisions.\n8.   Webinar presentations provide limited \nopportunities for exchange between presenter \nand audiences. Question and answer \nopportunities are presented but audiences seldom \nengage.\nWord choice\nExtension educators found the words they used \nto start the conversation and frame their message \nmade a difference in listener receptivity and \nopenness to learning. They advise:\n1.   Engage stakeholders by talking about the local \nweather.\na.   Begin by discussing current or recent \nweather and transition to long-term weather \n(climate) events and patterns (last month, last \nyear, and historical weather, such as the last 30 \nyears).\nb.   Terms like \u201cincreasing weather variability,\u201d \n\u201clong-term weather patterns,\u201d and \u201cextreme \nweather events\u201d and their local impacts are \nless controversial than the topic of climate \nchange.\nc.   Invite stakeholders to discuss past weather \nand climate differences they have observed \nover the course of their farming career and \nimpacts on their farm enterprise. This is an \nespecially good \u201cice breaker\u201d in group settings \nif at least one person in the audience has been \nfarming 30 or more years.\nd.   Defuse any tension that arises about \nclimate change by acknowledging that \nthe phrases \u201cclimate change\u201d and \u201cglobal \nwarming\u201d have become politicized. Then \navoid engaging in discussions about political \npositions and personalities which could \npolarize the exchange and close down \ndiscussion and exchange.\n2.   Once focused on the weather, move the \ndiscussion to how precipitation and temperature \nimpact different aspects of their operation and \ncrop management decisions. Ask how particular \nweather events affected their farm enterprise \n(e.g., drought caused plants to not germinate; \nsaturated soil delayed planting; flooding eroded \nsoil from productive \nfields making them less \nproductive; or how frost, \nplanting and harvest date \ntiming affected yields) and \nwhat they did in response.\n3.   In group discussions, \nencourage exchanges \namong peers regarding \nobservations of weather \nand climate patterns \nand how they adapted \n(changed their practices \nand management) \nbecause of the local \nclimate and weather \nconditions. Peer-to-peer \nlearning can accelerate \nuptake of information \nand motivation to try \nsomething new.\n4.   Situate local climate \nTerms like \u201cincreasing \nweather variability\u201d and \n\u201cextreme weather\u201d are \nless controversial than \nthe topic of climate \nchange.\nClimate Change and Agricultural Extension s 14\nand weather conditions within a regional \nand global climate context. It is important to \nrecognize that different geographies world-\nwide and within US regions experience climate \ndifferently. Farmers know this because they \nparticipate in global markets. Variable global \nclimate (e.g., drought in California or Brazil) \ndirectly affects the prices of seed, production \ninputs, and grain and whether they make a profit \nor lose money. \nHowever, these \n\u201cdistant\u201d events \nare viewed as \nsomething out \nof their control. \nLocal extreme \nweather events \nthat affect their \nproduction \nare more likely \nto grab their \nattention and \nmotivate them \nto act and adapt \nwhen they perceive they can manage or reduce \ntheir exposure to risk through their management \npractices.\n5.   Discussions of extreme weather patterns and \ntheir challenges build awareness and problem \nidentification. This creates a \u201creadiness\u201d in \nstakeholders to discuss solutions. Farmers are \nproblem solvers and once they have identified \nthe problem they are ready to explore options to \nsolve it. Once the problem is identified, educators \ncan transition into talking about how to prepare \nand adapt to more extreme and variable weather \nin the future.\n6.   Talk about trends over time, such as the \nrelationship between weather patterns and soil \nhealth, and what they might do about reducing \nerosion and increasing soil carbon.\n7.   Focus on solutions. Farmers can get frustrated \nif you don\u2019t quickly take the discussion to the \nlevel of solutions. Many people find global \nproblems, such as climate change, remote \nand difficult to connect to their own lives and \ndecisions. Behavior change is facilitated by a \npersonal sense of control. Perceptions of lack \nof control can be barriers to action. Focus on \nhow to adapt/take action/do something about \nthe weather and climate conditions that are \naffecting them. The U2U tools and products \nhelp stakeholders explore their options and find \nsolutions that fit their own situation [e.g. growing \ndegree days (GDD) tool; Split N tool].\n8.   There are three kinds of climate change \ndiscussions: science (extension\u2019s responsibility to \nconvey), assessments of current \u201cprobabilities\u201d \nand \u201cscenarios\u201d of potential climate trend \noutcomes on agriculture, and policy (not well \nreceived by farm or crop advisers). Knowing \nwhen and with whom to use each is important to \neffective education.\n9.   When talking about climate science, weather \nand climate data, and historical trends, it can \nbe helpful to talk about how data are generated \nwithout bias by thousands of volunteers and \nweather stations.\n10.   Climate science can be introduced by linking \nstakeholder perceptions of weather and climate \nto long-term data, and can be inserted into \ndiscussions to confirm perceptions and correct \nmisperceptions.\n11.   Utilize key moments in seasons to convey \nreal-time information and link to science-based \nadaptive strategies.\n12.   Be selective about using \u201cbuzz\u201d words \nsuch as \u201csustainability,\u201d \u201cresilience,\u201d \u201cadaptive \nmanagement,\u201d and \u201cstewardship,\u201d based on what \nyou know about your audience.\nThe message \nHow the message is framed can influence how \nreceptive stakeholders are to climate science and \nto discussing adjustments to current management \nas a response to changing conditions.\n1.   Frame the message around adapting to \nincreasingly variable and extreme weather and \nrelated threats to agriculture.\n2.   Embed the message within the context of \ncommon agricultural issues, to emphasize the \ninfluence of variable weather and climate to \nTerms like \u201cincreasing \nweather variability\u201d and \n\u201cextreme weather\u201d are \nless controversial than \nthe topic of climate \nchange.\n15\nagroecosystem impacts (e.g., productivity, off-\nfarm nitrogen and phosphorus losses, water \nquality, soil erosion, soil health).\n3.   Link changing longer-term weather \nand climate conditions to the need for risk \nmanagement strategies.\n4.   Help stakeholders identify current and local \nagricultural adaptive strategies that address \nincreasing extreme weather events and a variable \nclimate.\n5.   Talk about how changing and variable \nweather presents new opportunities for new \nmarkets, new crops, and new management \nstrategies.\n6.   Convey how university science can inform \nadaptive management options in response to \nextreme weather events, and variable climate \nconditions.\n7.   Deliver the science at an action-specific level. \nFor example, explain how nitrogen efficiency and \noff-field impacts are affected by too much or too \nlittle precipitation. Then invite the audience to \nexplore possible management options.\n8.   Help stakeholders identify something they \ncan do. Presenting a problem without solutions \ncan leave audiences feeling helpless and unable to \nact. \n9.   Some stakeholders fear increased regulation \ndue to community-scale problems, such as water \nquality. Help them connect extreme weather \nevents to these issues and point out how they can \nbe addressed at the local level through on-farm \nand watershed-level solutions.\nExtension educator challenges to \nintegrating climate science into \nextension programming\nChallenges and barriers \nThere are a number of challenges and barriers \nthat can make it difficult for extension and \noutreach educators to integrate climate science \ninto agricultural programming. These include: \n1.   Local norms associated with agricultural \npractices are generally focused on short-term \nrather than long-term outcomes. Therefore, \nthe concern about long-term weather patterns \n(climate) may not seem relevant to a stakeholder \nconcerned about the current season.\n2.   Stakeholders are faced with competing \nmessages about climate change and its impacts \nfrom media, local and national organizations and \nagencies, family, friends, and acquaintances.\n3.   University science associated with climate \nmay be viewed as a \u201cliberal\u201d institution \u201copinion\u201d \nrather than science.\n4.   Stakeholder discomfort and distrust of \nregulatory and legislative activities reduces \nwillingness to talk about climate change.\n5.   High levels of confidence that technology will \n\u201csave us\u201d can deter a stakeholder\u2019s willingness to \nconsider new management strategies.\n6.   University specialists utilize a variety of \nscientific sources which can lead to differing \ninterpretations of scientific facts. They also \nmay differ in beliefs and comfort levels about \nclimate science, which sends mixed messages \nto extension and outreach educators and their \naudiences.\n7.   University specialists sometimes lack \nunderstanding of local audiences and use \nlanguage and messages that do not well convey \nthe known science about climate and weather \nconditions.\nClimate Change and Agricultural Extension s16\n8.   Extreme weather problems (e.g., flooding, \nsaturated soils, drought, and extreme heat) are \nwell known and easily identified; but effective \nsolutions are less known and complex.\n9.   In the north central region, local climate \nobservations can differ from global climate \ntrends. Although overall temperature has \nincreased globally during the past century, \naverage daytime maximum temperatures \nduring Midwest summers have not increased \nappreciably.41 The global message sometimes \nconfounds the message NC region extension \nand outreach educators are giving to their local \naudiences.\n10.   Extension and outreach educators have a \nvariety of specialties that are often not related to \ncropping systems and climate variability impacts.\n11.   Extension and outreach educators, advisers \nand farmers lack understanding of how to \ninterpret and give meaning to probability and \nsynthesis derived from climate models.\n12.   Climate science resources for extension and \noutreach programming are limited. Extension \neducators need more research findings tailored to \nfarm decision-making to be able to give science-\nbased recommendations.\n13.   Some stakeholders perceive recommended \nbest management practices (BMPs) for resilient \ncropping systems are not practical for their \nmanagement system or locale.\nOvercoming challenges and barriers\nOvercoming the barriers listed above will require \npurposeful and specific programmatic planning \nto help reduce their impact and influence on \nstakeholders. Strategies for addressing these \nbarriers are:\n1.   Develop a regional capacity and \ncommunication strategy that prioritizes and \nintegrates opportunities for impact. (Barrier 6, 7, \n10, 11, 12)\n2.   Build a core group of farmers and service \nprovider leaders interested in learning and \nexperimenting with strategies to provide \nstakeholder support to extension programming. \nUse them as success stories. Encourage peer-to-\npeer learning that utilizes science. (Barrier 12, 13)\n3.   Partner with experts. Connect with state \nclimatologists, Regional Climate Center \nclimatologists, extension climatologists (where \navailable), university faculty and agencies \nsuch as National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration (NOAA) to increase professional \nclimate science knowledge and to provide a \nresource for stakeholders to ask questions beyond \nextension and outreach educator expertise. \nContinue to strengthen connections among \nextension climatologists, educators, and crop and \nlivestock specialists. (Barrier 2, 5, 6, 8, 11)\n4.   Sustain current relationships and be \npurposeful in expanding relationships with \nfarmers and advisers to increase trust in \nExtension. (Barrier 2, 3, 9)\n5.   Use examples of recent extreme weather \nevents and impacts at field, farm, and watershed \nlevels to get farmer and advisers attention. \n(Barrier 1, 2, 7).\n6.   Offer farmers and advisers hands-on \nresources and tools (e.g., U2U tools, GDD, \nSustainable Corn CAP research). (Barrier 7, 10)\n7.   Leverage existing Extension, Natural \nResource Conservation Service (NRCS), Soil and \nWater Conservation Districts (SWCD), and other \nconservation organizations to expand outreach. \n(Barrier 10)\n8.   Increase funding for field-level research and \ndemonstrations that address climate-resilient \ncropping systems and improve the transfer of \nknowledge to extension and outreach educators \nfor use in recommendations. (Barrier, 6, 10, 12)\n9.   Demonstrate adaptive management strategies: \ncover crops, controlled drainage, erosion control \npractices, tillage comparisons, and rainfall \nsimulator, using field days and videos. (Barrier 1, \n6, 7, 12) \n10.   Focus on young and next generation farmers \nwho are tech savvy and often open to new \nsolutions. (Barrier 1, 3, 4, 12, 13)\n11.   Establish adaption demonstration sites at \nstate agricultural research stations. (Barrier 1, 2, \n4, 7, 12, 13)  \nsss\n17\nInstitutional and structural resources \nand challenges\nCurrent climate extension and outreach \nprogramming across the north central (NC) \nregion varies by state and institution. The NC \nCooperative Extension Association and the \nNC Regional Association of State Agricultural \nExperiment Station Directors have created \nan online directory of these climate-related \nactivities. See www.nc-climate.org. \nBeyond extension specialists supported by \nUSDA-NIFA grants \u2013 the Sustainable Corn \nCAP and U2U projects \u2013 only a few states \nhave extension specialists with explicit climate \nprogram responsibilities. But some NC region \nland grant universities (LGUs) are proactively \nconducting needs assessments and crafting \nstrategies.\nIn 2012 and 2013, the USDA-funded Great Lakes \nRegional Water Program and their partners \nconducted a needs assessment, surveying \nextension educators, from LGUs and National \nSea Grant College Programs, in six states in the \nNC region. They measured extension educators\u2019 \nknowledge, confidence and perceived barriers to \nproviding climate change adaptation education \nfor stakeholders. The study revealed a high level \nof need to increase educators\u2019 knowledge about \nclimate change. This study also found a much \nBuilding North Central Region Extension and \nOutreach Institutional Capacity \nPart 3\nClimate Change and Agricultural Extension s18\nhigher capacity to do climate change adaptation \neducation among Sea Grant educators, and \nrecommended that LGUs learn from Sea Grants \ngoing forward. Another of the group\u2019s activities \nwas to create climate change educational core \ncompetencies for outreach professionals (not \nspecific to agriculture). \nThe University of Wisconsin established the \nUniversity of Wisconsin-Extension Climate \nChange Task Force in 2014. They conducted an \nassessment last year across all four extension \nprogram areas and found relevance to many \nexisting programming topics. Further, a \nsurprisingly high percentage of educators were \nalready doing climate change education in some \nform or thought Extension should be doing \nclimate change education.\nThe NC region has a number of agencies and \norganizations with missions and expertise \nassociated with different aspects of climate and \nagricultural sciences that could serve as resources \nand partners with LGU extension and outreach \nefforts. \nEvery state has a state climatologist. In the \nCorn Belt, nearly all of them are associated with \nland grant universities, while a few are in state \nagriculture (IA) or natural resources departments \n(MN). Many of them may already be involved \nwith extension programs at some level. Some are \nmore versed in linking climate to agriculture than \nothers, but they are a critical resource with access \nto historical climate data, an awareness of trends \nand current conditions across their state, and an \nunderstanding of seasonal forecasts. \nThe NC Region Water Network addresses \nmany water-related issues that are associated \nwith changing climate conditions. (See http://\nnorthcentralwater.org/.) Climate change and \nadaptation is a priority issue for the network \nand is associated with agriculture\u2019s influence on \nwater resources such as nutrient and manure \nmanagement, and soil health. The Network can \nhelp connect climate researchers and educators \nwith those more focused on crops and livestock. \nIn addition, the Network provides seed funding \nfor building LGU extension capacity to address \nclimate adaptation and mitigation needs. Seed \nfunding can be used to increase competitiveness \nfor larger grants, deliver programs, or provide \nprofessional development for university \nspecialists and educators.\nThere are potential partner institutions in the \nregion (NOAA, Regional Climate Centers (RCC), \nGreat Lakes Integrated Sciences and Assessment \nProgram (GLISA), USDA Midwest and Northern \nClimate Hubs, Sustainable Agriculture Research \n& Education (SARE), National Drought \nMitigation Center (NDMC), DOI Climate \nScience Centers, NCR Water Network, National \nIntegrated Drought Information System (NIDIS), \nstate monitoring networks which provide \nweather data, and local watershed groups that \nperform water, weather, and/or climate outreach \nfunctions. However, many of these do not have \nagronomic and/or social sciences expertise linked \nto their climate science outreach missions.\nExtension educator needs identified\nExtension and outreach educators and scientists \nare partners in assuring university-generated \nscience is extended to non-scientific audiences. \nIf extension and outreach educators are to \ndisseminate university science, how can we best \nensure that they know about and understand \nuniversity-generated climate science? Extension \nand outreach educators are often responsible for \nmultiple geographic areas and subject matters. \nThis suggests a need for local weather and climate \ninformation. How might we make the structure \nmore fluid to facilitate the science-to-educator \ntransfer? \nExtension and outreach educators in the \nSustainable Corn CAP and U2U projects \nidentified a number of needs that would help \nthem be more effective in their programming:\n1.   Timely receipt of university climate and \n19\nagricultural science, in accessible language that \ncan be shared with extension educator clients/\naudiences.\n2.   Opportunities for formal and informal \nscience and knowledge exchanges among \nuniversity scientists and extension and outreach \neducators.\n3.   Opportunities to communicate with and \nbuild relationships with state and university \nclimatologists.\n4.   Opportunities and/or mechanisms to involve \nextension and outreach educators in defining the \nresearch questions that make science more useful \nto stakeholders.\n5.   Increased communication among field staff \nand state specialists.\n6.   More audience-specific tools, products, \neducational materials, media, and on-line \nresources.\n7.   Effective ways of incorporating climate \nmaterials into agricultural production \nprogramming.\nInstitutional support\nExtension serves a wide variety of stakeholders \nwith different needs. These stakeholders often \nhave differing and sometimes conflicting \npriorities that make extension and outreach \nprogramming a challenge. Extension, in general, \nhas not yet developed a coordinated effort to \nidentify priority investments at the intersection \nof climate and agriculture at state and regional \nlevels. There is \na need for more \ntranslational \nresearch \nand meta-\nanalysis that \nsynthesizes vast \nresearch results \ninto useful \ninformation \nthat extension \nand outreach \neducators can \nuse. \nInstitutional observations and suggested \naction items to increase NC region LGU \nextension relevance and effectiveness are:\n1.   Commitment to climate change adaptation \nand mitigation in agriculture must be \nstrongly signaled at all levels of the extension \norganization. USDA is providing a consistent \nmessage that the nation must act to adapt to \nclimate change and reduce emissions of heat-\ntrapping gases. Extension programs should match \nthat message.\n2.   Purposefully and systematically work to \nensure that extension and outreach educators are \nconsistently exposed to locally-relevant science \non climate change and agriculture. \n3.   Generate science that answers critical \nquestions for agriculture, and put the science in \nusable formats and language that enhance the \nability of extension and outreach educators to \nconvey the science.\n4.   Strengthen partnerships. University scientists \nshould be proactive in sharing the science \nwith extension and other university personnel \nwith outreach responsibilities in a timely and \naccessible way.\nSummary of recommendations for \ninstitutional and structural support \nto initiate and continue climate and \nagriculture programming \nThe training, experiences and lessons learned by \nextension and outreach educators participating \nin the USDA-NIFA Sustainable Corn and \nU2U projects over the last five years provide a \nstrong foundation and a unique opportunity \nfor LGUs in the region to build and strengthen \ninstitutional capacity to provide extension \nprogramming at the intersection of climate and \nagriculture. Climate science and our agricultural \nstakeholders and partners tell us the need for \nthis programming will continue. Institutional \nsupport that addresses the needs of extension and \noutreach educators and trains and supports new \nand current educators is needed to leverage this \nopportunity. \nExtension and outreach\neducators and scientists \nare partners in assuring\nuniversity-generated \nscience is extended to\nnon-scientific audiences.\nClimate Change and Agricultural Extension s 20\n1.   Establish core leadership groups. At state and \nmulti-state (NC region) levels, create core groups \nconsisting of scientists and educators responsible \nfor leading climate and agriculture exchanges and \nprogramming for stakeholders.\n2.   Identify other program areas needing to \nintegrate climate education. Extreme weather \nand an increasingly variable climate will have \ndifferential effects on most of Extension\u2019s \nstakeholders. This report only addresses what \nhas been learned from work with corn-based \ncropping systems in agriculture. Climate \neducation and outreach will also need to be \nintegrated into community development, \n4-H and youth and family programming.\n3.   Designate an agri-climate coordinator \nfor each state. LGU investments in an agri-\nclimate coordinator (e.g., state specialist \nposition) in each NC state can help \nincorporate climate variability and climate \nchange information into programming and \nserve to increase tools and resources. \n4.   Increase and improve communication \nbetween land grant university researchers \n(with and without extension appointments) \nand extension educators. Land grant \nuniversity researchers need to do a better \njob communicating climate-related scientific \nfindings to extension educators. Similarly, \nextension and outreach educators need to \ncommunicate to researchers what they are \nhearing from farmers, agricultural advisers, \nand agriculture and conservation agencies \nand organizations \u2014 those with a stake in \nresearch results. Extension educators can \nhelp ensure that research is both meeting \nuser needs and is communicated effectively.\n5.   Continue to cultivate relationships with \nagricultural advisers. Extension administration, \nfaculty, and field staff must continue to cultivate \nrelationships with agricultural advisers and \nexpand programs that emphasize agricultural \nadvisers as recipients of university research \nand tools. Given that farmers and agricultural \nadvisers trust Extension, and given that the \nnumber of extension personnel is decreasing \nin many states, strengthening programming to \nagricultural advisers can maximize impact and \nbe a strategic allocation of land grant university \nresources.\nPotential roles and responsibilities of \nan agri-climate coordinator \nThe intent of identifying faculty and staff \nwith agri-climate coordination roles and \nresponsibilities is to increase communication \nand coordination exchanges and access \nto content within Extension and among \nuniversities, agencies, and stakeholders. The \ngoal is for Extension to 1) help stakeholders \nto better understand current and predicted \nagricultural impacts of extreme weather events \nand variable climate, and 2) provide information \nand alternatives for adapting and minimizing \nimpacts in response to changing conditions. An \nagri-climate coordinator would link individuals, \noutreach programs, and research in ways that \n21\nfacilitate exchanges associated with climate, \nweather and agriculture. This would include \ntracking the science within the university \nand across the region, and nationally linking \ndepartments, curricula and programs. It could \ninclude relationships with Natural Resources \nConservation Service, state departments of \nagriculture and the environment, US Army \nCorps of Engineers, National Oceanic  and \nAtmospheric Administration, U. S. or a regional \nEnvironmental Protection Agency office, \nprivate natural resource organizations, and \nagribusinesses.\nRoles associated with communication, \ncontent and coordination might include:\nCommunication\n1.   Facilitate exchanges with the USDA regional \nclimate hubs and LGUs.\n2.   Facilitate exchanges between university \nresearchers and extension educators.\n3.   Work with media including social media to \ndistribute and collect information appropriate \nto the NC region with special attention to the \ndifferences between regional and international \ntrends.\nCoordination\n1.   Identify funding opportunities and potential \nteams to seek out funding.\n2.   Initiate and support regional meetings of \nextension and outreach educators.\n3.   Connect with public and private partners and \nstakeholders.\n4.   Proactively collaborate with state \nclimatologists to ensure/increase agricultural \ncapacity for analyzing and interpreting data and \ninformation exchange.\n5.   Work closely with the NC Region Water \nNetwork to develop and provide a regional short \ncourse for extension and outreach educators \ndesigned to include basic climate science and \nclimate change adaption, management and \ncommunication, thus building a cohort of \nexpertise and a support network.\n6.   Explicitly build relationships with the NOAA \nRegional Climate Centers (RCC) to leverage \nresources within the region.\nContent\n1.   Develop and/or identify web-based resources \nfor use by educators and stakeholders.\n2.   Increase extension and outreach educators\u2019 \nfamiliarity with and access to climate data and \ntools; and describe how they could be used in \nExtension ANR programming.\n3.   Encourage and identify institutional \nincentives for extension faculty and staff to \nsynthesize and interpret data for extension and \noutreach educator use. \n4.   Develop program delivery metrics for \nextension and outreach climate programming.\n5.   Monitor, assess and evaluate data and \ndecisions support tool needs of extension \neducators, crop advisers and farmers. \nsss\nClimate Change and Agricultural Extension s 22\nExecutive Summary\n1.

The CSCAP \nseeks to increase resilience and adaptability of Midwest agriculture to more volatile weather patterns \nby identifying farmer practices and policies that increase sustainability while meeting crop demand.\nTHE ISSUE\nCorn is essential in America. The highly versatile crop is an economic powerhouse, employing \nmillions and producing food, feed and fuel. American farmers heavily invest their time, land and \nmoney in the crop\u2019s production, planting more than 20 percent of all U.S. cropland to corn. \nGlobal and domestic demand for corn continues to rise. However, there is increasing uncertainty \nabout how long-term U.S. climate trends are impacting corn-based cropping systems and \nthreatening agricultural investments. In response, farmers are seeking new ways to ensure \ncontinued crop productivity while also minimizing environmental impact.\nTHE PROJECT\nThis five-year project assesses the environmental, economic and social impacts of long-term \nclimate variability on corn-based cropping systems. The project gathers data from 35 field test sites \nin 8 Midwestern states to focus on ways to best promote the system\u2019s long-term sustainability and \nproductivity.\nTHE RESEARCH\nResearchers from a variety of disciplines are working together to unleash groundbreaking \ncollaborative work. In field sites across the Midwest, researchers are measuring carbon, nitrogen, \ngreenhouse gas and water flows from crop management practices, including tillage, cover crops, \ncorn-soybean rotation, extended crop rotations, controlled drainage water management and \nnitrogen management techniques. Some researchers are using models to explore how crop \nmanagement practices on variable soil types and climate conditions affect carbon and nitrogen \nlevels in the water and air. Others are surveying farmers\u2019 current management practices and their \nadaptation to changing weather patterns.\nThis diverse team is sharing data in a single comprehensive database to bring about greater \nknowledge and insight on the various implications of the research. Extension and education \nspecialists are using this enhanced understanding to create programs for farmers, teachers and \nstudents, and are working to connect them with valuable project resources and analyses.\nWHO\nA partnership among Iowa State University; Lincoln \nUniversity; Michigan State University; The Ohio \nState University; Purdue University; South Dakota \nState University; University of Illinois; University \nof Minnesota; University of Missouri; University of \nWisconsin; USDA Agricultural Research Service \u2013 \nColumbus, Ohio; and USDA National Institute of Food \nand Agriculture (USDA-NIFA).\nWHAT\nThis five-year project assesses the environmental, \neconomic and social impacts of long-term climate \nvariability on corn-based cropping systems. The \nproject focuses on ways to encourage resilient \ndecision-making, maintain yields and reduce \nenvironmental impact.\nHOW\n1. Develop standardized methodologies and \nperform baseline monitoring of carbon, nitrogen \nand water footprints, crop productivity, and pest \npressure at agricultural test sites across the \nMidwest.\n2. Evaluate how crop management practices impact \ncarbon, nitrogen and water footprints, crop \nproductivity, and pest pressure at test sites.\n3. Apply models to research data and climate \nscenarios to identify impacts and outcomes that \ncould affect the sustainability and economic \nvitality of corn-based cropping systems.\n4. Gain knowledge of farmer beliefs and concerns \nabout climate change, attitudes toward adaptive \nand mitigative strategies and practices, \nand decision support needs to inform the \ndevelopment of tools and practices that support \nlong-term sustainability of crop production.\n5.

Two years of carbon, nitrogen, and water data collected across the CSCAP research network. \nResearchers completed baseline and Year Two measurements on corn-based cropping systems, including collecting \nagronomic, soil, and water data across 35 field research sites in 8 Midwestern states. \n2. Centralized database constructed to functionally increase data sharing and analyses. Entry and \nimport features of the team\u2019s centralized database were created to allow team members to efficiently enter data, share data and \naccess data for analyses.\n3. Climate and agricultural models calibrated and integrated. Crop, soil, water, and systems models\u2014including \nDAYCENT, SALUS, DNDC, SWAT, EPIC, and VIC\u2014were calibrated and integrated to enable research that can capture and \naddress the complexity and geographic scale of corn-based systems\u2019 environmental footprint.\n4. Survey of 5000 farmers from 22 watersheds representing 60 percent of US corn production. Results \nshow that 66 percent of farmers in the region believe that climate change is occurring, 31 percent are uncertain, and four \npercent do not believe it is happening. Farmers who believe it is occurring and due to human activity (41 percent) expressed \nhigher levels of concern about potential impacts and were more likely to support adaptation and mitigation activities than those \nwho attribute climate change primarily to natural causes, are uncertain about its existence, or do not believe it is occurring. For \nmore details, see: http://www.sustainablecorn.org/videos.html#Arbuckle.\n5. 20 Land Grant University (LGU) Extension Educators enrolled 92 farmer cooperators. Across ten \nLGU\u2019s, extension educators formed farmer working groups to discuss long-term weather shifts and related management \ndecisions. Educators received climate training and prepared materials for farmers on topics such as the recent drought and past \nflooding events.\n6. Teachers and high school students engaged in experiential learning and applications of science. \nTwenty-six individuals participated in two interactive summer camps where they learned from CSCAP scientists about climate \nscience, agricultural production, and global challenges related to natural resources and climate.\n7. Next generation scientists created a roadmap for becoming disciplinary and transdisciplinary \nscholars. The project\u2019s 35 graduate students created a roadmap defining their disciplinary and transdisciplinary project \nexpectations and opportunities. While learning their disciplinary science, graduate students gave presentations and created \nposters for the annual meeting, participated in monthly working groups, and served on project committees.\n8. Leveraged financial resources to accomplish more. Scientists reached out to key partners and leveraged the \nUSDA investment to acquire an additional $1.02 million for project activities in year two.\n9. 370 Presentations, fact sheets, newsletters, videos and refereed journal articles produced. Team \nmembers communicated agronomic, soil, water, and greenhouse gas information to farmers, agribusiness, and scientists. Many \nof the communication pieces can be found on the CSCAP website: www.sustainablecorn.org.\n10. Team members learned more about each other\u2019s disciplinary science to build collaboration \nand capacity as a transdisciplinary project. Working groups, printed materials and a series of speed science \npresentations were employed to build working knowledge and identify points of connectivity across the CSCAP\u2019s six objectives \nand 140 members.\nCSCAP is a regional collaboration supported by USDA-NIFA Award No. 2011-68002-30190,  \u201cCropping Systems \nCoordinated Agricultural Project (CAP): Climate Change, Mitigation, and Adaptation in Corn-based Cropping Systems.\u201d \nThe 11 institutions comprising the project team include: University of Illinois; Iowa State University; Lincoln University; \nMichigan State University; University of Minnesota; University of Missouri; The Ohio State University; Purdue University; \nSouth Dakota State University; University of Wisconsin; and USDA-ARS Columbus, Ohio.\nJanuary 2013; CSCAP-149-2013\nThe Climate and Corn-based Cropping Systems CAP (CSCAP) is \na transdisciplinary team creating new science and educational opportunities. The \nCSCAP team seeks to develop a suite of practices that heighten system capacity to: \n1) retain and enhance soil organic matter nutrient and carbon stocks, 2) reduce off-\nfield nitrogen losses that contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and water pollution, \n3) better withstand droughts and floods, and 4) ensure productivity under different \nclimatic conditions.\nN2O H2OCO2\nField with/without a cover crop.

CSCAP \nscientists are working to better understand the complex \ninteractions among our changing climate; crop management \npractices; and carbon, nitrogen and water footprints, to identify \nadaption and mitigation strategies for farmers and policy \nmakers. \nWhat we know\u2026\n\u2022   Agriculture covers 40-50% of the Earth\u2019s land surface; it \naffects and is affected by greenhouse gas levels. \n\u2022   Increases in greenhouse gases (GHG) such as CO2 (carbon \ndioxide) and N2O (nitrous oxide) warm the earth\u2019s surface \nand impact rainfall, snow cover, humidity, winds, and regional \ntemperatures.\n\u2022   Increased CO2 is expanding habitable zones for invasive \nspecies. Higher temperatures and increased moisture \ncontribute to accelerated growth of plant pathogens and insect \npopulations. \n\u2022   Nitrogen fertilizer efficiency\u2014the fraction of applied nitrogen \nthat is absorbed and used by the plant\u2014is influenced by \nmoisture and temperature. \n\u2022   During rains and snow melts, nitrogen that has not been \nabsorbed by plants can be lost off-field in the form of nitrates, \nwhich move through subsurface tiles and other subsurface flow \npaths into nearby streams and eventually into rivers. Nitrates \nfrom Midwestern crop fields are a major cause of the hypoxic \nzone in the Gulf of Mexico\u2014a large region of water that has \nvery low oxygen concentrations and therefore cannot support \naquatic life.\n\u2022   High crop yields coupled with the efficient use of nitrogen \nfertilizer achieve the lowest GHG emissions per unit of yield.  \n\u2022    Management practices that build soil organic matter can \nhelp to maintain long term productivity of soils.\nSeeking to know more\u2026\nThere is still much scientists do not know about the complex \ninteractions among our changing climate and agricultural \nsystems. Some of the questions CSCAP scientists seek to \nanswer as a result of this project are:\n\u2022   How do changes in drainage water management alter yield \nvariability and nitrogen and water use efficiency? To what \nextent can drainage water management increase soil water \nstorage and reduce overall nitrate export to streams?\n\u2022   How do cover crops increase soil carbon, soil aggregation \nand soil water infiltration and affect year-to-year variability in \nyield? To what extent can cover crops reduce nitrate leaching \nby taking up residual soil nitrate? What is the effect of cover \ncrops on yield in different corn production systems under \nvarying weather stresses and diverse terrains?\n\u2022   How do tillage management systems, winter cover crops, \nextended rotations, and drainage systems impact the GHG \nfootprint of corn production systems?  How does sensor-based \nnitrogen (N) fertilizer management impact the GHG footprint?\n\u2022   How do changes in weather patterns and potential changes \nin agronomic and soil management (such as cover crops, \nwater drainage management, extended crop rotations, reduced \ntillage) influence pest cycles? \n\u2022   What are the life-cycle environmental and resource impacts \nand trade-offs of alternative corn management systems under \nprojected future climate scenarios? \n\u2022   What is the least-cost placement of cover crops and \ndrainage management to achieve nutrient reduction goals in \nindividual watersheds in the Upper Mississippi River Basin and \nthe entire Basin? How does the optimal placement and cost \nchange when crop prices increase?\n\u2022   In what ways do farmers perceive climate change as a threat \nto their livelihoods and how do their perceptions influence their \nwillingness to be supportive of or adopt adaptation strategies?\nFor more information, contact:\nLois Wright Morton, CSCAP Director and Professor, Iowa State University, lwmorton@iastate.edu, 515-294-2843\nLori Abendroth, CSCAP Project Manager, Iowa State University, labend@iastate.edu, 515-294-5692\nLynn Laws, Communications Specialist, Iowa State University, lynnlaws@iastate.edu, 515-294-7380 www.sustainablecorn.org\n",

Wisconsin is a major dairy-pro-\nducing area where winters are typically very \ncold and snowy and summers are hot and \nhumid. According to the researchers, the state \nis an ideal geographical region for examining \nthe effects of a range of climatic factors on \ndairy production. The study identified the \neffects of temperature and precipitation,  \nboth jointly and separately, on milk output. \nThe analysis showed that increasing tempera-\nture in summer or in autumn is harmful for \ndairy production, whereas warmer winters  \nand warmer springs are beneficial. In contrast, \nthe study showed that more precipitation had \na consistent adverse effect on dairy productiv-\nity. Overall, the analysis showed that over the \npast 17 years, changes in climatic conditions \nhave had a negative effect on Wisconsin  \ndairy farms. Alternative scenarios predict  \nthat climate change would lead to a 5 to 11 \npercent reduction in dairy production per year \nbetween 2020 and 2039 after controlling  \nfor other factors.\naniMal health anD proDuction  \nanD aniMal proDucts: \nBovine respiratory disease (BRD) is the  \nleading natural cause of death in beef and \ndairy cattle, causing annual losses of more \nthan 1 million animals and $692 million.

In Ohio alone, that suppression  \nis estimated to have cost $2.9 billion during \nthe past 20 years, according to a NIFA-funded \nstudy by the ohio state University\u2019s ohio \nagricultural research and development \nCenter\u00a0scientists. The study documents \ntemperatures, changes in cultural practices, \nsoybean varieties and technology in soybean \nproduction from 1970 to the present. The \nstudy found that for every 1 C (1.8 F) rise  \nin temperature during the growing season, \nsoybean yields fell by about 2.4 percent.  \nSome crop management strategies such as  \nthe development of new cultivars and hybrids, \nchanges in planting dates, the use of cover \ncrops, and greater management of crop \nresidues from the previous year could help \nlimit the potential negative impacts of  \nweather variations. \nLettuce contains a gene that prevents seed \ngermination if it gets too hot, and that could \nbe trouble in California and Arizona\u2014two \nstates that produce more than 90 percent  \nof the lettuce grown in the United States. \nResearchers at the University of California-\ndavis identified a gene in wild lettuce that \nallows for germination at higher temperatures \nand transferred that gene into commercial \nlettuce. The resulting lettuce variety can be \ngrown in more locations with multiple growing \nseasons, reducing the need for shipping. \nAdditionally, growers do not have to use as \nmuch water to cool the soil as they would use \nfor traditional lettuce varieties. Collectively, \nthe new lettuce variety results in greater profit \nfor farmers, more fresh lettuce for consumers, \nand reduced greenhouse gas emissions. \nAmerican corn production covers about 95 \nmillion acres on 400,000 farms and brought \nin about $65 billion in 2013.

Combining  \nthese data, the team found that produce  \nfields should be set back from areas of  \nmanure application by at least 160 meters. \nThe University of Vermont Extension and  the \nVermont Vegetable and Berry Growers \nAssociation collaborated to develop the \npractical, affordable, and innovative Commu-\nnity Accreditation for Produce Safety (CAPS) \nto meet the needs of Vermont\u2019s diverse \nproduce farms. The certification reassures \ncustomers and retailers that produce grown \nlocally was handled using best practices to \nminimize food safety risk. The Food Safety \nModernization Act targets large-scale produc-\ners with food safety practices and certification \nprograms but it leaves medium-sized and \nsmall producers without food safety creden-\ntials that would offer them credibility in the \nmarketplace. So far, the CAPS program has \nengaged growers with approximately 1,500 \nacres of total vegetable production with an \nestimated value of $9 million in annual sales \nfor the state.\nimpacts\nThE nifa food safEty portfolio focusEs on strEngthEning  the food safety system by reducing the incidence of foodborne illness  to the greatest extent possible.

Given these success-\nes, Cornell extension partnered with field  \nand fork network and fair food network to \ndevelop double Up food Bucks (DUFB). \nDUFB is a project awarded from NIFA\u2019s new \nFood Insecurity Nutrition Incentive grants \nprogram.  The program matches \nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program \npurchases of fresh fruits and vegetables, up to \n$20 per visit, at partici-pating farmers \nmarkets. Since its launch, more than 3,100 \ntransactions were processed, 92 percent of \ncustomers increased consumption of fresh \nfruits and vegetables and 70 percent of \nparticipating farmers are making more money.\nNIFA\u2019s\u00a0expanded food and nutrition educa-\ntion Program (EFNEP)\u00a0provides nutrition \neducation to low-income families, especially \nthose with young children. EFNEP educators \nare members of the communities they serve, \ntrained and supervised by university and \ncounty-based professionals. Using hands-on \nmethods, they teach participants how to eat \nhealthy, be more physically active, stretch their \nfood dollars, handle food safely, and be more \nfood secure. The program operates in all 50 \nstates, in more than 800 counties, reaching \napproximately 500,000 people each year; \nabout 74 percent of adult participants are from \nminority populations. In 2015, EFNEP provided \n$67.9 million to 75 land-grant universities that \nworked directly with 119,351 adults and \n377,702 children. Through EFNEP, 95 percent \nof adults improved their diet, for example, by \nconsuming an additional \u00bd cup of fruits.\nrootdown la, a community food project \noperating in three South Los Angeles neigh-\nborhoods with the help of the youth partici-\npants, works closely with members of the \ncommunity to grow fresh fruits and vegetables \nand provide access to more quality food.  \nThe major encouragement of all of RootDown \nLA\u2019s activities is for people to choose to eat \ngood food. The impact also goes beyond \nnutrition and access to food; RootDown  \nLA provides employment for local youth  \nto manage activities at their various sites. \nMany early participants are now paid staff \nwho handle day-to-day operations and \nmanage youth interns and the network  \nof neighborhood gardens.\nFood deserts are locations without ready \naccess to fresh, healthy, and affordable foods. \nNIFA is working to eradicate food deserts \nthrough the Community food Project (CFP) \ngrants program.

Researchers \nselected 15 feral colonies, living in trees or \nbuildings without human management, and  \n24 colonies managed by beekeepers in urban, \nsuburban, and rural areas. The researchers \nanalyzed the bee colonies to quantify the \nabundance and diversity of pathogens present \nand the bees\u2019 immune responses to this \npathogen pressure. The research team found \nthat colonies closer to urban areas experi-\nenced greater pathogen pressure. The prob-\nability of survival in laboratory experiments \ndeclined three-fold in bees collected from \nurban environments compared to those \ncollected in rural environments. The results of \nthis study are critically important for develop-\ning approaches to protect the health of honey \nbees, whose numbers have been declining  \nin the United States over the last few years. \nAnimal science researchers at the University \nof missouri are working to improve feed \nefficiency in beef cattle. Investigators have \nlocated the chromosomal regions responsible \nfor growth performance that help cattle get \nthe most out of what they eat. Armed with \nthis knowledge, cattle producers will be able  \nto build their herds by selecting and breeding \nstock that best possess this trait. These  \n\u201cfeed conversion\u201d genes are located on \ndifferent chromosomes in different breeds,  \nso herd improvement selection criteria will \nvary by breed. By increasing the nutritional \nefficiency of their herds, cattle producers  \nwill see higher profits by reducing the amount \nof feed it takes to raise cattle. This will also \nreduce the environmental footprint of beef \nproduction by reducing amount of manure  \nand greenhouse gases. \nDarius Jones is a success story. Jones is the \nvice president and general manager of gar-\nfield Produce, a hydroponics farm in South \nSide Chicago.

Responding to and \nmanaging for this complex interaction, E x M x G, is the \nchallenge facing farmers, advisors, scientists, agencies, \nand policy makers.\nUpper Midwest food, feed, fiber, and fuel are produced \nunder environmental, market, and social conditions \nthat are dynamic and unpredictable\u2014sources of both \nopportunity and potential disaster. Further complicating \nmanagement decision-making is that research-based \nrecommendations are not always able to be extrapolated \nmore than a few miles because of spatial variability in \nweather and climate, soil, land cover and topographical \nconditions. This means intensive agricultural research \nis critical to ensure resilience and long-term vitality of \nthe farm enterprise. Farmers, scientists, and agencies \nmust work collaboratively to reduce the risk to farm \neconomies and environmental health while increasing \nthe benefits gained from row-crop agriculture. \nThe USDA-NIFA Sustainable Corn CAP project has been \nresearching this complexity and evaluating solutions for \nsustainable crop adaptation to variable and changing \nweather patterns. The team has studied the impacts that \nfarmers\u2019 decisions and a variety of management practices \nhave on the carbon, nitrogen, and water footprints \nof Midwest corn-based cropping systems. These \nmanagement practices, often integrated at the field level, \ninclude controlled drainage, cover crops, reduced tillage, \nnitrogen sensing, and diversified crop rotations. \nThe synthesis of disciplinary sciences drawn from \nfield experiments and models in conjunction with the \nknowledge and experiences of cooperating farmers has \nenabled the team to evaluate a suite of adaptive solutions. \nThe overarching criteria used to guide the viability of \nsolutions were continued productivity for U.S. farmers \nand minimization of unintended consequences on the \nnatural environment. This technical report, Climate and \nManaging Corn-Soybean Agroecosystems 2: Findings, \nImplications and Recommendations, is the second volume \nof research-based outcomes from the Sustainable Corn \nCAP project. This report highlights additional key results \nnot published in Volume 1.\nThe integration of the team\u2019s biophysical and social \nsciences in current and future climate scenarios are \nwoven throughout this volume. The outcomes from \none discipline inform and build on the work of others \nto produce robust recommendations toward systems \nmanagement. \nThe findings, implications, and recommendations \nhighlighted on the following page are for cover crops \nand serve as an example of the integration found in this \nreport for other management practices across carbon, \nnitrogen, and water. \nVol. 2 Climate & Managing Corn-Soybean Agroecosystems s v\nHIGHLIGHTS OF FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\u2022 Current cultivars and management practices under \nprojected future temperature increases of 2\u02da C or \nmore are likely to lead to corn yield declines of 33% \non average over the Midwest. The predicted decline \nin yields do not account for the potential inclusion \nof adaptive on-farm management practices to \nchanging conditions.\n\u2022 Improved management practices such as cover crops \ncan partially offset the projected yield decline in \nfuture climate scenarios associated with increased \ntemperature and changes in precipitation patterns, \nbut these practices are not sufficient to reverse the \neffects.\n\u2022 In a climate model-based scenario, one-third to \none-half of a random sample of Corn Belt grain \nfarmers indicated they would increase their use of \ncover crops, no-till and/or tile drainage to adapt to \nchanges in climate.\n\u2022 There are potential maladaptive properties \nassociated with the use of cover crops, no-till and \ntile drainage. For example, a potential increase in \nherbicide use may occur with cover crops. \n\u2022 A winter rye cover crop has shown benefits in terms \nof water and soil conservation and reduced nitrous \noxide (N2O). However, management is a critical \nfactor in maximizing benefits and minimizing \nnegative cash crop impacts. For example, poor corn \nestablishment and yield can occur if timing of cover \ncrop termination is too late. \n\u2022 Iowa commercial farms where corn was planted \nfollowing a rye cover crop had greater presence of \nand feeding injury to corn by the true armyworm, \nan early season insect pest, compared to corn fields \nthat did not plant a cereal rye cover crop. \n\u2022 Model-based life cycle assessment has identified \na winter rye cover crop added to the corn-\nsoybean rotation provides substantial life-cycle \nimprovements in water quality and reduces soil loss \nper ton of corn, but increases total fossil energy use \nand has variable impacts on life-cycle emission of \nclimate forcing gasses. \n\u2022 Greater benefits of cover crops could occur under \nfuture climate conditions in reducing nitrogen losses \nto streams and proximate water bodies. \n\u2022 Although cover crops are known to add additional \ncarbon back to the soil, this is a long-term \ninvestment. Based on project experiments, more \nthan four years of cereal rye cover crops are \nnecessary before a significant increase in soil organic \ncarbon becomes measurable.\n\u2022 Farmers\u2019 uncertainty about projected climate change \nimpacts on their production systems is influenced \nby their beliefs about climate change, experiences \nwith drought, concern about heat stress on crops, \nand agricultural information networks. Outreach \nand engagement efforts to increase willingness \nto adapt will need to be tailored to each farmer\u2019s \nunique situation. \n\u2022 Development of expanded cost sharing programs \nand other approaches are recommended to reduce \ncover crop costs for producers and encourage \ngreater cover crop adoption on-farm.\nThe following are excerpts from the full report representing the trade-offs related to the addition of a cereal rye \ncover crop into the suite of farmers\u2019 management practices. \n11\nclimate and\nmanaging corn-soybean\nagroecosystems 2\nFindings, Implications and Recommendations\nNinety-four million acres of land in the United States were planted to corn in 2016 with most grown \nin the upper Midwest. The Midwest soils and climate \nmake it among one of the highest producing corn-\nsoybean regions in the world, with 10-20 percent of its \ncrop exported annually. According to USDA, the U.S. \n2016 corn crop of over 15.1 billion bushels surpassed \nthe previous record of 14.2 billion bushels set in 2014. \nMidwestern states have set yield records over the past \nfew years with Minnesota producing a record 193 bu/ac, \nIndiana 173 bu/ac, Illinois 197 bu/ac, and Iowa 203 bu/\nac in 2016. That statewide yield for Iowa is an all-time \nrecord for any major corn producing state in the United \nStates. \nMidwest agriculture also is one of the major exporters \nof sediment and nitrogen (N) that contributes to \ndecreasing water quality in the region, with impacts \non the Great Lakes and Mississippi and Ohio rivers, \ntheir tributaries and downstream. In 2013, the hypoxia \nzone in the Gulf of Mexico covered about 5,800 square \nmiles, which is larger than Connecticut. The National \nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) \nestimates harmful algae blooms that lead to hypoxic \nconditions in U.S. marine waters cost on average $82 \nmillion annually due to impacts on public health, \ntourism and the seafood industry. The governor of \nOhio in 2014 declared a state of emergency as the city \nof Toledo issued a \u201cdo not drink/do not boil the water\u201d \nnotice to over 400,000 residents, due to toxins from \nblue-green (cyanobacteria) algae blooms. These blooms \nwere caused in part by N and phosphorus (P) in western \nLake Erie, the city\u2019s drinking water source. Land use, \nwater flow modifications, increased nutrient loadings \nincluding N and other pollutants, food web alterations, \nand a changing climate all have been implicated as causal \nagents for the changes in our river, lake, and ocean \necosystems (NOAA 2016).\nDay-to-day weather variability and longer-term shifts \nin weather patterns and climate directly and indirectly \naffect United States agricultural productivity and the \nagroecosystems associated with crop production. \nThe productivity and environmental impacts of the \ncorn-soybean system are strongly influenced by \nthe timing and extreme variations in temperature, \nprecipitation, wind and humidity throughout the \ngrowing season. Local weather conditions \u2013 historical, \ncurrent and forecast \u2013 affect a myriad of farm decisions: \nselection of crop and seed variety; timing of planting, \nfertilization and harvest; disease and weed control; \nwater management; crop rotations and tillage practices \n(Klemm and McPherson 2017). Changes in the Midwest \nclimate have lengthened the growing season by almost \ntwo weeks since 1950. This is due in large part to earlier \noccurrence of the last spring freeze (Pryor et al. 2014). \nContinued, small, long-term average temperature \nincreases are projected to shorten the duration of corn \nreproductive development with potential future yield \ndeclines. Abundant precipitation during the growing \nsection 1. Introduction\nVol. 2 Climate & Managing Corn-Soybean Agroecosystems s 2\nseason in recent years has produced high crop yields, \ndespite some farmers experiencing significant delays \nin spring planting because of saturated soils early in \nthe spring. However, increases in extreme precipitation \nevents have increased the volume and speed of runoff \nwater, accelerated rates of soil erosion, and led to high \nlevels of off-field, off-farm N and sediment losses into \nnearby waters. \nWeather and climate impacts on regional and local \ncorn-based systems and their agroecosystems in the \nMidwest have been the focus of the biophysical and \nsocial-economic research conducted by the USDA-\nNational Food and Agriculture Institute (NIFA) Climate \nand Corn-based Cropping Systems Coordinated \nAgricultural Project (CAP) (aka Sustainable Corn CAP) \nteam (2011-2017). The intent of the project was to better \nunderstand how management practices in corn-based \nsystems affect N, carbon (C) and water cycles under \nvariable weather and climate, and to identify strategies \nthat have the potential for implementation by farmers \nand industry with support through policy. This volume, \nClimate and Managing Corn-Soybean Agroecosystems 2: \nFindings, Implications and Recommendations (Vol 2 of \n5), along with Volume 1, Climate and Managing Corn-\nSoybean Agroecosystems 1: Findings, Implications and \nRecommendations (Vol 1 of 5), present key findings and \nrecommendations from the research conducted by the \nSustainable Corn CAP team. \n1.1 SYNTHESIS AND \nINTEGRATION OF SCIENCES \nInterdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research are \ncrucial to advance agricultural sciences and address \ncomplex societal challenges related to the sustainable \nproduction of food, feed, fuel and fiber under \nincreasingly variable weather and a changing climate. \nResearch on carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and water cycles \nin corn-based systems provides new knowledge, valuable \ninsight and guidance for improving the management of \nthese systems to create more resilient agroecosystems. \nA resilient agroecosystem has the ability to absorb \ndisturbances to the system \u2013 such as high precipitation, \ngrowing season drought, or new patterns of consistently \nabove normal temperatures \u2013 and still retain its basic \nfunction and structure. Basic functions and structure \nof the corn-based agroecosystem encompass yield \nproductivity, retention and enhancement of soil organic \nC (SOC), water availability for plant growth, protection \nof water resources, N and other nutrients retained on-\nfield and on-farm for plant consumption, and not lost to \nthe atmosphere as N2O or to proximate water bodies that \ncan degrade local and downstream water conditions.\nThe Sustainable Corn CAP was a multi-pronged \nresearch, extension and education initiative consisting \nof a central database; field and landscape level crop \nexperiments using standardized protocols for core \n3Institutions\nField Research\n(may represent more\nthan one research site)\nFIGURE 1  |  Location of  \nSustainable Corn CAP \nparticipating institutions and \nfield research sites. \nmeasurements; primary and secondary social and \neconomic data; and historical, current and forecast \nclimate data from experimental sites and the region. \nIn Volumes 1 and 2, site specific and system-scale project \ndata have been synthesized and integrated to inform \nthe challenge of climate change adaptation for upper \nMidwest agricultural systems. The research includes not \nonly the biophysical findings pertaining to grain yield, C, \nN and water cycles, but also the social science findings \non the views and practices of farmers who are managing \nthe landscape and seeking ways to adapt to changing \nconditions while assuring productivity and protecting \nthe agroecosystem.\nAn integrated research approach across experimental \nfield site locations captured crop and environmental \nresponses under a suite of management practices. Within \nthese different practices, team scientists measured \ncarbon, nitrogen, greenhouse gas, water quality and flow, \npest populations and agronomic indicators.\nA set of local, regional and national scale models utilized \nthe field research data to examine current and predicted \nimplications of the various practices on C, N and \nwater under different climate conditions. Additionally, \nfarmer social and economic behaviors and responses to \nchanging climate and weather were integrated to identify \npractices most likely to be implemented. \n1.2 BIOPHYSICAL AND SOCIAL-\nECONOMIC RESEARCH DATA \nCOLLECTED\nVolume 1 (pages 2 to 9) contains a full description of the \nSustainable Corn CAP team\u2019s methods, experimental \ndesign, biophysical and social-economic research \ndata collected, spatial coverage and USDA National \nAgricultural Statistics Service (NASS) acreage and \nproduction data for corn, soybean and wheat. A \nsummary is provided here of the research scope. \nAn expansive field research network of 35 sites \ncomprised the biophysical research network with sites \nin all project states except South Dakota (Figure 1 \nand Appendix B). This network combined previously \nexisting research sites with newly established sites to \ncomprehensively address the team\u2019s research agenda. \nThe team selected management practices widely used \nby farmers as well as comparative practices that were \nrelatively novel or not yet widely implemented across \nthe landscape. Management practices were studied to \ndetermine adaptation and mitigation capacity relative \nto climate change, and to measure overall productivity \nand sustainability indicators. Management practices \ninvestigated include corn-soybean rotation; cover crops \n(cereal rye in particular) within a corn-soybean rotation; \nAgri-Climate Education: Preparing the Next Generation s 4\nBig\nBlue\nBig\nSioux\nDes\nMoines\nElkhorn\nIowa\nKaskaskia\nLoup\nLower\nIllinois\nLower\nPlatteMiddle Platte\nMinnesota\nMissouri\nLittle\nSioux\nMissouri\n Nishnabotna\nPatoka\nWhite\nRock\nSoutheastern\nLake\nMichigan\nUpper\nIllinois\nBlack Root\nMaquoketa\nPlum\nSkunk\nWapsipinicon\nWabash\nWestern\nLake Erie\nFIGURE 2  |  Social economic research at \nthe HUC 6 watershed level map. \nextended and diverse crop rotations; organic cropping \nsystem; drainage water management; canopy N sensing; \nand tillage management (no-till and conventional). \nRefer to Volume 1 Appendix D for a complete listing of \nmanagement practices associated with each field site.\nMost research sites began collecting data in 2011 and \nmeasured parameters for five years through the 2015 \ngrowing season. Project scientists collected data using \nstandardized protocols developed by the team prior \nto the first field season (Kladivko et al. 2014). Refer to \nVolume 1 Appendix E for a detailed list of data collected \nby the team that spans crop, soil, water, greenhouse \ngas (GHG) and pest measurements. Research data \nwere uploaded to the team\u2019s central database by team \nmembers with review and quality control performed \nby database managers to ensure data integrity and \nadherence to standardization with iterative exchanges \noften occurring (Herzmann et al. 2014).\nThe team\u2019s social-economic research focused on an \nunderstanding of Corn Belt farmers\u2019 perspectives on \nclimate change and potential adaptation and mitigation \nstrategies. Primary data were collected using a mixed \nmethods approach: a major random sample survey, \nconducted in partnership with the USDA-NIFA funded \nUseful to Usable project, of 4,778 farmers across 11 \nUpper Midwest Corn Belt states (Figure 2), plus in-depth \ninterviews and pre-post surveys with a select group of \nfarmer cooperators. The 2012 random sample survey, \nwhich was stratified by 22 HUC 6 (Hydrological Unit \nCode) watersheds, drew its sample from the USDA \nNASS Census of Agriculture master list of farmers. \nTo date, this remains the largest scientifically rigorous \nsurvey focused on farmers and climate change. Refer to \nVolume 1, pages 8-9, for more information pertaining to \nthis farmer survey. \nThe second major social science research component \nconsisted of in-depth interviews with 159 farmer-\ncooperators recruited from the Sustainable Corn CAP \nextension educators\u2019 networks. The interview process \nconsisted of two parts: a longitudinal survey (baseline \n2012 and follow-up 2015), and in-depth interviews in \n2013 with the 159 cooperating farmers. \nVol. 2 Climate & Man g ng Corn-Soybean Agroecosystems\nResearch conducted at individual experimental sites provided data that are the basis of findings and \nrecommendations developed for that location and those \nsimilar to it. Each experimental study is essentially a case \nstudy that is locale and temporally specific. Thus, site \nspecific findings may or may not be directly applicable \nto a wider geographic region due to differences in \ntopography, soils, spatial location and weather, as well \nas farm management approaches. Regional syntheses \nand modeling enable the scaling up of these findings \nto a broader expanse of the landscape by identifying \ncommonalities and expected responses. Modeling \nwith climate projections enabled the prediction of how \nmanagement practices might perform in the future \nunder different climate and weather scenarios and \nthe impacts on the landscape. The integration of field \nexperiments, social-economic findings, climate data \nand modeling were used to produce systems-level \nrecommendations for current and future production \nscenarios. Findings derived from modeling are noted in \nthe report as follows:            \n \nFinding based on modeling\n2.1 CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE \nUPPER MIDWEST\nThe Midwest during the last century has seen an increase \nin extreme rainfall events and flooding, increased heat \nwave intensity and frequency, and increased humidity \n(Pryor et al. 2014). The 3rd National Climate assessment \ndocuments longer growing seasons for the Midwest and \nrising carbon dioxide levels that have increased the yields \nof some crops, but projects these benefits are likely to \nbe progressively offset by extreme weather events. Heat \nwaves during pollination are threats to corn and soybean \nyields; and wetter springs can lead to farmers changing \nto late-planted shorter-season varieties with potential \nimpacts on yields. These trends have increased risks of \nsoil erosion, declining water quality, degraded air quality \nand increases in harmful blooms of algae, especially in \nthe Great Lakes. The weather and climate of the Midwest \nare the context and drivers of project findings that are \nreported in the following sections.\n2.1.1 Model performance under \nfuture climate \nComplex agroecosystem models, such as those used to \nsimulate crop yield and the environmental impacts of \ncrop production, are based on assumptions from prior \nliterature and past experiments when data are available. \nThese models may inaccurately predict crop system \nand ecosystem performance under future climate if \nrepresentative experimental data are not available to \ncalibrate and test the models. In the Sustainable Corn \nCAP, field experiments were used to improve model \nassumptions and subsequently, the accuracy and \nrobustness of model output across the range of climatic \nconditions of the prediction period. Experimental data \ngathered from controlled field experiments are valuable \nin ground truthing model assumptions and are critical \nsection 2.    findings, Implications, Recommendations\n5\nfor model calibration. However, despite experimental \nfield data, model assumptions may not account for how \nfarm management decisions in aggregate under different \nconditions will affect the larger landscape.\nFinding based on modeling:  The use of more than \none General Circulation Model (GCM) showed the \nchoice of GCM can lead to substantially different \noutcomes when climate change information from \nGCMs is used for watershed basin modeling. \nThe research captured the range of precipitation \nand temperature results from GCMs that were \nincluded in phase 3 of the Intergovernmental \nPanel on Climate Change (IPCC) Coupled Model \nIntercomparison Project (CMIP3; PCMDI, 2007). \nRefer to Appendix 3.1 for a description of the GCMs \nused (Panagopoulos et al, 2015). \nImplication: The use of a single GCM can produce \nmisleading results when climate change information \nfrom GCMs is used for analysis of possible \nfuture climate impacts on Corn Belt agricultural \nproduction, including assessment of how the \nuncertainties in climate change projections feed \nthrough to uncertainties in outcomes for agriculture \nand water. Multiple GCMs provide a basis for a \nmore comprehensive and robust analysis, including \nquantification of uncertainties.\nRecommendation: Multiple GCMs, sampling the \nfull range of projected possible future climates for \nmid-century (2046 to 2065) and other future time \nperiods, should be used when performing analyses \nof possible future climate impacts on Corn Belt crop \nproduction and corresponding best management \npractices (BMP) and/or cropping system effects. \n2.1.2 Translation of experienced \nweather and climate data to \ndecisions\nClimate scientists rely on observed historical weather \nand climate data to inform current and future climate \nmodel projections. Similarly, agricultural producers \nuse historical events\u2014recent past experiences and \nhistorical narratives\u2014to construct local knowledge to \nassess, quantify and manage current and future risks. \nThese historical data, events and experiences become \nreference points or analogs when compared to a current \nphenomenon that exhibits similar characteristics specific \nto past conditions.\nFinding:  In-person interviews with Corn Belt \nfarmers reveal past experiences and decisions \ninfluence farmers\u2019 perceptions of current and future \nrisks, and are used to integrate scientific climate \ninformation to inform decision-making (Wilke and \nMorton 2017).\nFinding:  Intergenerational narratives and \nexperiences with recent past extreme weather events \noften become analog years used as benchmarks by \nfarmers to build knowledge about effects of weather \nand climate shifts, and to guide current and future \ndecisions (Wilke and Morton 2017).\nImplication: Decision-making is a continuous \nsocial learning process where information from \npast experiences, personal and intergenerational \nknowledge, and personal values are synthesized and \nused as input, when relevant to current decisions. \nRecommendation: Encourage farmers to use a \nperformance-based management approach that \nmeasures, monitors and evaluates historical data on \ncrops, management practices and weather to assess \nimpacts on yields, loss and gain of soil C stocks and \nother outcomes. Tracking long-term changes in \nfield and farm outcomes, along with local weather, \ncan reduce inaccuracies associated with long-term \nmemory of events.\nWeather station in field plot at Purdue University.\nRecommendation: Climate science communication \nand outreach efforts to farmer audiences can be \nimproved when future climate model scenarios are \nplaced in the context of past weather and climate \nevents that have affected agriculture. Including a \npast timescale that includes recognizable climatic \nevents important to farmers provides personal \nassociations with the data presented, and offers a \ncontext for evaluating potential impacts of future \nscenarios. \nFinding:  A random sample survey showed the \nmajority (65%) of 4,496 farmers in the upper \nMidwest agreed or strongly agreed there was too \nmuch uncertainty about the impacts of climate to \njustify changing their agricultural practices and \nstrategies. Farmers\u2019 uncertainty about projected \nclimate change impacts on their production systems \nis influenced by their beliefs about climate change, \nexperiences with drought, concern about heat stress \non crops, and agricultural information networks \n(Morton et al. 2017). \nImplication: This finding suggests a combination \nof insufficient information and normative \ninfluences on climate beliefs are influencing farmer \nuncertainty.\nRecommendation: In cases where uncertainty \nis caused by insufficient information, improved \nfarmer access to and use of historical crop and local \nclimate records, as well as decision support tools \nthat simulate different climate scenarios and their \nimpacts on production, could improve estimates \nof future risks. However, more information may \nbe insufficient to address claims of uncertainty \nwhen differing political and cultural norms contest \nthe parameters of climate change. This suggests \nscientific knowledge must be linked to social values \nand beliefs and trusted agricultural networks for \nwidespread adaptive management to a changing \nclimate to occur.\nFinding:  Past research (Arbuckle et al. 2014) \nemployed latent class analysis of characteristics that \nare not directly observable (e.g., climate change \nbeliefs, risk perceptions) to identify six classes \nof farmers with different perspectives on climate \nchange, and recommended communication might \nbe tailored to segments of farmer audiences. Further \nresearch (Arbuckle et al. 2017) compared the six \nclasses of farmers using observable characteristics \nsuch as farm type, land management practices, \nand farmer demographics and found insufficient \nsystematic, meaningful patterns of difference in \nthose observable characteristics to guide or justify \naudience segmentation. In other words, farmers who \nbelieved anthropogenic climate change is occurring, \nthat it poses risks to agriculture, and that adaptive \naction should be taken, were not substantively \ndifferent in terms of observable characteristics \nsuch as farm size, farm characteristics, and farmer \ndemographics from farmers who denied the \nexistence of climate change.\nRecommendation: Any climate change engagement \nefforts by University Extension and other \nagricultural stakeholders should (1) use caution \nwhen looking to observable characteristics to \nfacilitate audience segmentation, and (2) work to \ndevelop outreach materials that appeal to broad \nfarmer audiences.\nMichigan State University Extension field day.\nImplication and Recommendation: While some \nCorn Belt grain farmers indicated they would \nincrease use of key adaptive management practices \nin response to a changing climate, many others \nexpressed they would not. This suggests different \noutreach and engagement on adaptation strategies \nwill be needed to increase willingness to adapt. \nFinding:  Farmers who reported greater concern \nabout climate change and who were more supportive \nof adaptive action also tended to report their \nagricultural decisions were more influenced by key \nagricultural actors such as University Extension and \nsoil and water conservation agencies. Farmers who \nwere less concerned about climate change and who \ntended not to support adaptive action (between one-\nthird and one-half of farmer survey respondents) \ntended to be less influenced by key actors in \nagricultural social networks (Arbuckle et al. 2017).\nImplication and Recommendation: Extension \nand other stakeholder groups that work with \nfarmers should seek to expand their outreach and \nprogramming efforts to engage farmers who are not \nalready within their spheres of influence.\nFinding:  In a climate model-based scenario, one-\nthird to one-half of a random sample of Corn Belt \ngrain farmers indicated they would increase their \nuse of cover crops, no-till and tile drainage to adapt \nto projected climate changes (Roesch-McNally et al. \n2016).\nFinding:  Among Corn Belt farmers who indicated \nthey would increase their use of cover crops, \nno-till and tile drainage in response to predicted \nclimate changes, positive attitudes towards climate \nchange adaptation, and higher levels of perceived \nrisks associated with climate change were positive \npredictors of intentions to increase their use of the \npractices. Confidence in the adequacy of current \npractices was a negative predictor of intention to \nadapt (Roesch-McNally et al. 2016). \nFinding:  Farmers who placed higher importance on \nvisiting other farmers to learn from their practices \nand strategies, as well as farmers who were already \nusing cover crops, no-till, or tile drainage, were \nmore likely to report intentions to increase use of \nthe practices to adapt to predicted climate changes \n(Roesch-McNally et al. 2016).\nObservation: There are potential maladaptive \nproperties associated with the use of cover crops, \nNT and tile drainage. For example, a potential \nincrease in herbicide use may occur with cover \ncrops. Or increased short-circuiting of nitrate-N \nto streams may occur due to tile drainage systems \ncompared to non-tiled fields. Since farmers likely \nwill increase use of all of these practices, research \nshould continue to document the potential positive \nand negative impacts associated with these adaptive \nstrategies at the field and landscape scale.\nVol. 2 Climate & Managing Corn-Soybean Agroecosystems s8\nIowa State University Extension field day.\nImplication and Recommendation: Findings \nalso highlight the importance of farmer networks \nin expanding the use and adoption of adaptive \nstrategies, suggesting development of robust farmer \nnetworks that include farmer exchanges around \nscientific findings, and opportunities to observe and \nexperiment with practices, will be important for \nincreasing adaptation actions.\nA synthesis of key findings from Corn Belt farmer \nsurveys and in-depth interviews has expanded our \nunderstanding of Corn Belt farmers\u2019 perspectives on \nclimate change, their responses to extreme weather \nevents and their attitudes towards adaptation and \nmitigation. This aggregation of other findings resulted in \na series of recommendations for scientists, Extension and \nland managers to communicate and engage farmers and \ntheir crop advisors with Extension and land managers on \nthe topic of climate change (See Volume 3 in this series \nfor more detail, Morton et al. 2016 and Roesch-McNally \net al. In Review). \n50 million acres (20 million hectares) of soybean have \nbeen grown in this region. Refer to Volume 1 for state-\nlevel production data and trends. \n2.2.1 Crop yield in future climate\nThe following results are based on model simulations \nusing current management practices and genetics (i.e. \ncultivars) for the Midwest. Projecting crop yields in \nthe future requires the use of existing biophysical data \navailable from this project and other sources such as \nUSDA National Agricultural Statistics Service and \nan expectation of how land will be managed in the \nfuture. There are many variables that can change model \nprojections and accuracy, such as shifts in management \npractices at the farm and watershed levels. Social science \nresearch from this team has shown farmers\u2019 willingness \nto change the way they farm when they identify a \nproblem exists with current practices. The findings, \nimplications and recommendations presented here \nlargely represent the biophysical and climate constraints \nin the future. \nFinding based on modeling:  Under projected \nfuture climate and with current cultivars and \nmanagement practices, corn yield is expected to \ndecline on average over the Midwest by 33%, but \nyield increases are predicted for states like Michigan \n(+27%) and Wisconsin (+9%). The decline in \npredicted yield is associated with temperature \nincreases by 2\u02da C or more in the future while \nretaining current management practices and crop \ngenetics; these do not consider adaptation practices \n(Basso et al. 2015).\nImplication: Improved \nmanagement practices such as \nthe addition of manure, cover \ncrops, extended and diversified \ncrop rotations, springtime or \nsplit applications of N fertilizer \nand no-till can partially offset the \nprojected yield decline in future \nclimate scenarios associated \nwith increased temperature \nand changes in precipitation \npatterns, but these practices \nare not sufficient to reverse the \neffects. New cultivars along with \nbest management practices will \nneed to be introduced to adapt to \nchanging climate conditions. \nRecommendation: When working directly with \nfarmers, focus the discussion on reducing weather-\nrelated risks to their operation associated with more \nextreme and variable weather, rather than \u2018climate \nchange.\u2019\nRecommendation: Encourage farmers to identify \nactions they can take to adapt to more extreme and \nvariable weather on their farms. \nRecommendation: Farmers are problem solvers \nwho are concerned about soil and water resources \nupon which the future of their farm operation \ndepends. Explore soil and water conservation \nstrategies as ways to purposefully reduce off farm \nN, other nutrients and soil losses; and link to future \nproductivity and water quality concerns.\nRecommendation: Work closely with scientists to \ndevelop continuous communication feedback loops \namong scientific findings, local knowledge and \nexperiences to improve information exchanges.\n2.2 CORN AND SOYBEAN \nPRODUCTION AND \nMANAGEMENT\nThe majority of U.S. corn and soybean production \noccurs in the nine-state region of the upper Midwest, \nwhere the Sustainable Corn CAP project was conducted. \nThe dominant cropping system in this region has been \nan annual rotation of corn and soybean. For the past five \nyears, 60 million acres (24 million hectares) of corn and \n< Farmer harvesting corn and unloading grain for \ntransport to on-farm storage\nFinding based on modeling: Temperature increases \nresulting from a changing climate are the main \nfactor in corn yield declines many decades into the \nfuture. These yield declines are not offset directly by \nthe use of a cereal rye cover crop. \nImplication: A cereal rye cover crop has shown \nbenefits in terms of water and soil conservation \nand reduced nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, but \nit is crucial that management is implemented \nto maximize benefits and minimize losses. For \nexample, poor corn establishment and yield can \noccur if timing of cover crop termination is too late. \nFinding based on modeling: Model-based life cycle \nassessment indicates that including a cereal rye \ncover crop in the corn-soybean rotation provides \nsubstantial life-cycle improvements in water quality \nand reduces soil loss per ton of corn, but increases \ntotal fossil energy use and has variable impacts on \nlife-cycle emission of climate forcing gasses. \nImplication: Under predicted future climate, life-\ncycle impacts in all categories are likely to increase \nper ton of corn despite the presence of a winter rye \ncover crop in the corn-soybean rotation.\nVol. 2 Climate & Managing Corn-Soybean Agroecosystems s 10\n2.2.2 Management practices for \nyield stabilization or optimization\nEach year, farmers modify their management practices \nin an effort to provide the most hospitable environment \nfor the crop, given their knowledge and financial capital. \nManagement practices differ in complexity for a farmer \nto implement due to their investments in equipment, \nchanging price structures of seed and fertilizer inputs, \nand weather variations that may limit the use of certain \npractices or field work operations from occurring. \nManagement practices noted in this section are \nspecifically focused on crops grown, tillage used and the \nintegration of cover crops into existing crop rotations. \nThe reduction in tillage so the field is managed with \neither \u201creduced tillage\u201d or \u201cno-till\u201d has the potential to \nsubstantially decrease soil loss, but these practices can be \na challenge for some farmers to establish in certain areas \nof the Corn Belt. \nFinding: Crop yield stability was greatest in no-till \nmanagement compared to conventional tillage at a \nselection of research sites in the Corn Belt during \n2009 through 2013.\nCorn Nitrogen Application\nCorn/Soybean \nPlanting\nCorn/Soybean Harvest Corn/Soybean \nPlanting\nCorn/Soybean Growth\nCover Crop Growth  \nResidual Nitrate Uptake\nCover Crop Seeding Terminate Cover Crop\nWINTER CEREAL RYE COVER CROP\nAPR MAY JUN JUL AUG SEPT OCT NOV DEC JAN FEB MAR APR\nFIGURE 3  |  Timeline for planting, growing \nand terminating a winter cereral rye \ncover crop \nImplication: No-till management may be used \nto stabilize yields annually as affected by weather \nvariability and spatial land variability across the \nCorn Belt. No-till management can help retain soil \nfrom erosion loss, which has long-term benefits. \nDiversification of the predominant cropping system to \ninclude a third crop can be a powerful tool for farmers \nto reduce economic risk, disrupt pest cycles, increase \nsoil resilience and improve water quality. However, the \ntype of crop (grass or legume, annual or perennial) as \nwell as the type of production practices surrounding the \ncrop determines the ultimate impact, whether positive or \nnegative, on the soil and water. \nFinding: Continuous corn yielded 0 to 20% less \nthan corn rotated with soybean in Wisconsin and an \naverage of 15-20% less in Illinois. Corn in the corn-\nsoybean-wheat rotation yielded 5 to 10% more than \ncorn in corn-soybean in Wisconsin, except for the \nnorthernmost location that is similar to findings in \nIllinois where corn has yielded about 5% more. \nImplication: Corn grown in a rotation consistently \nyields more than corn grown in repeated \nmonoculture. This finding holds for differing \nenvironments as results were consistent across \nWisconsin and Illinois sites. Farmers can maximize \ncorn yields by rotating with soybean, and more by \nadding wheat into the rotation. \nFinding based on modeling: Adoption of cover \ncrops across 95% of the cropland (80,000,000 ac or \n32,000,000 ha) in the Upper Mississippi River Basin \n(UMRB) and Ohio-Tennessee River Basin (OTRB) \ncould result in a cost of reducing N of $15 to $37 \nper lb ($7 to $17/kg) and P of $187 to $493 per lb \n($85 to $224/kg) based on the total cost divided by \nthe total N loads or total P loads (Kling et al. 2014). \nThe N and P loads were estimated via simulations \nperformed with the Soil and Water Assessment Tool \n(SWAT) model. This assumes cover crop costs range \nfrom $25/ac to $35/ac ($61.8/ha to $86.6/ha) based \non data reported in the Iowa Nutrient Reduction \nStrategy and other sources. \nImplication: Development of expanded cost sharing \nprograms and other approaches are recommended \nto reduce cover crop costs for producers and \nencourage greater cover crop adoption by producers \nin their field operations.\nFinding: Focus groups with Iowa farmers identified \nchallenges to cover crop adoption including both in-\nfield barriers and structural barriers (e.g., markets, \ninfrastructure) that constrain their inclination and \nability to integrate cover crops into their production \nsystems (Roesch-McNally et al. 2017). See Figure 3 \nfor a visual display of the management timing with \ncover crops.\nFinding: Farmers have found creative ways to \novercome in-field and structural barriers to \nsuccessfully integrate cover crops into their cropping \nsystems. Successful adopters were found to have \nimplemented a \u201cwhole systems\u201d approach to cover \ncrops management, in which they prioritize the \nsuccess of their cover crops by focusing on multiple \naspects of management, including changes they \nhave made to nutrient application and modifications \nto equipment. Farmer-to-farmer networks were \nfound to be important factors in reducing barriers \nand facilitating adoption of cover crops (Roesch-\nMcNally et al. 2017).\nFinding: Focus group participants emphasized the \nimportance of diversified cropping systems and \nlivestock in helping farmers adopt cover crops across \na wider expanse of land in production (Roesch-\nMcNally et al. 2017).\nImplication: Attention must be paid to structural \nconstraints to cover crop adoption for this practice \nto become more widespread. This might include \nreducing barriers by creating markets and other \nincentives for more diversified agriculture in the \nCorn Belt and opportunities for livestock and crop \nintegration. Further facilitation of farmer-to-farmer \nnetworks will help farmers experiment and adopt \ncover crops in their operations through a trial and \nerror approach and share their results with others. \n2.3 INTEGRATED PEST \nMANAGEMENT\nA changing climate impacts Midwest temperature, \nprecipitation, humidity and other weather variables; \nand is expected to continue influencing abundance and \nreproduction rates of pest populations and migration \npatterns. The term \u201cpest\u201d encompasses diseases, weeds, \ninsects, and animals that can destroy or damage a \n11\ncrop. Integrated pest management (IPM) is a systems \napproach to managing pests that integrates practices \nincluding regular monitoring with intent to control pests \nwith chemical, mechanical, and biotic mechanisms to \nreduce crop damage, economic losses and environmental \nimpacts. Micro-climates and local weather variability \n(e.g. temperatures, high precipitation, drought, and high \nrelative humidity) in conjunction with crop development \ninfluence the timing and rates of pest migration and \nreproduction of plant pathogens, weeds, and insects. \nSome of the environmental variables that affect pest \npressure include:\n\u2022 Longer growing season (shifted frost dates)\n\u2022 Warmer winters\n\u2022 Warmer nighttime temperature\n\u2022 More frequent severe precipitation events\n\u2022 Increased atmospheric humidity\nFinding: Observations from the 1950s through the \npresent show increasing atmospheric humidity in \nthe upper Midwest, especially since 1980.\nRecommendation: The potential for increased \nhumidity to exacerbate pest and disease pressure \nneeds more in-depth research so recommendations \nfor adaptive measures can be devised.\nFinding: Iowa commercial farms where corn \nwas planted following a cereal rye cover crop had \nsignificantly greater presence of and feeding injury \nto corn attributed to the true armyworm, an early \nseason insect pest of \ncorn, compared \nto cornfields that \ndid not plant a \nrye cover crop \n(Dunbar et al. \n2016 b). \nRecommendation: Although true armyworm is \nmore common in fields planted to corn following \na cereal rye cover crop, significant feeding injury \nto corn remains sporadic but possible. Therefore, \nfarmers should scout for feeding injury and true \narmyworm larvae from corn emergence through the \neighth leaf (V8) developmental stage. \nImplication: Several species of pest insects migrate \nduring the spring. Field or crop attractiveness, \nscouting technique and pest management practices \nvary by pest species of insect. Some species may be \nlimited to the field edge, like common stalk borer, \nwhereas others may colonize the entire field if it is \nattractive, like true armyworm.\nImplication: At present, there are no seed \ntreatments or genetically modified corn hybrids \nlabeled for true armyworm management. Foliar-\napplied insecticides are labeled for and effective, \nhowever, the need for an application of insecticide \nfor management of true armyworm should be based \non scouting and economic thresholds. Prophylactic \nuses of foliar-applied insecticides are not cost \neffective, as populations are sporadic. \nRecommendation: Farmers planting cereal rye \ncover crops should focus their scouting and pest \nmanagement efforts on fields planted to corn \nfollowing the cover crop. Early termination of the \ncereal rye cover crop can reduce the risk of injury \nto corn from early season pest insects and diseases, \nhowever, weather and field conditions may hinder \nefforts to terminate the cover crop when necessary. \nGraduate student Mike Dunbar, Iowa \nState University, collects beneficial \nand pest insect data in extended crop \nrotations that include wheat.\nImplication: Education on early season pest \nmanagement is important to successful production, \nespecially when using cover crops and/or no-till.\nRecommendation: Cover crop adoption policy \nshould include consideration of increased pest \nmanagement costs. \nFinding: Ground-dwelling, beneficial arthropod \ncommunities and individual taxa did not differ \namong three cropping systems: continuous corn, \n2-yr annual rotation of corn and soybean, and a 3-yr \nannual rotation of corn, soybean and wheat. These \nexperiments were conducted in long-term rotation \nplots in Illinois and Wisconsin (Dunbar et al. 2016 \na). \nImplication: All crops noted above in the \ncropping systems are annual crops and associated \nwith agricultural practices that make infield \nhabitat subject to anthropogenic disturbances \nand temporally unstable. Habitat instability and \ndisturbance can limit the effectiveness and retention \nof beneficial arthropods, including natural enemies, \ngranivores and detritivores.\nRecommendation: Farmers wanting to enhance the \nbeneficial arthropod communities within their fields \nshould consider increasing non-crop and perennial \nspecies within landscapes in conjunction with more \ndiverse rotation schemes.\n2.4 WATER CYCLE\nClimate and weather are drivers of the water cycle. \nAll parts of agricultural watersheds are connected at \nmultiple temporal and spatial scales by flows of surface \nand ground water, transport and transformation of \nphysical and chemical materials and movement of \norganisms (USEPA 2015). The incremental effects of \nartificial tile lines, ditches and channels, individual \nstreams and wetlands are cumulative across entire \nwatersheds and must be evaluated in that context. \nThe use of water by crops varies during the growing \nseason based on the development stage, with specific \nstages highly sensitive to limitations or excess water. \nThe availability of water during the growing season is \nnecessary for achieving high grain yields, but the need \nfor water to be drained away to reduce ponding and \nsaturated soils is equally important in many areas of the \nupper Midwest. The role of subsurface drainage systems \nis to drain water, providing trafficable conditions for field \nwork and proper soil conditions for crop growth.\nInteractions among land use, vegetative cover and \nthe timing, rate and duration of water delivered by \nprecipitation affect soil moisture, sediment transport \nand runoff. Downstream waters are the time-integrated \nresult of all waters contributing to them. Thus, aggregate \nsediment and nutrient contributions to any particular \nstream from a single event or over multiple years can \ndegrade the integrity of downstream waters. There is \nstrong evidence headwater streams function as nitrogen \nsources and sinks for river networks. Rapid nutrient \ncycling in small streams has the potential to remove 20-\n40% of N that might otherwise be exported downstream \n(USEPA 2015). Nitrogen and other nutrients can lead \nto over-enrichment of aquatic life and cause dissolved \noxygen concentrations to fall below levels necessary \nto sustain most stream and streambed life. Nutrient \noverload (eutrophication) can have significant effects \ndownstream (hypoxia). \n13\nbecause of peak water consumption by the plants \noccurring. However, flooding still is possible as intensity \nof rainfall is an important factor. A shortage of water \nfor crop use can happen throughout the growing season \nwith detrimental effects on the yield potential of corn \nand soybean. Overall, corn is less resilient to water \nstress because of its determinate growth habit in which \nthe plant flowers (silks) during a short period and \nsevere moisture stress can hamper kernel fertilization. \nIn contrast, soybean has a longer window of time of \nflowering because of its indeterminate growth habit. The \noverlap of the vegetative and reproductive growth in \nsoybean allows for compensation by later flowers set by \nthe plant if a period of water stress occurs. \nFinding: Controlled drainage did not result in a \nstatistically significant change in crop yield in any \nof the experimental sites across the Midwest region. \nControlled drainage decreased the rate of water table \nrecession by 29 to 62% in Indiana, increasing the \ntime needed for the water table level to fall from the \nsurface to 30 cm and 60 cm depth by approximately \n12 to 26 and 24 to 53 hours, respectively.\nThe Sustainable Corn CAP team has examined water \nstress on crop production, drain flow in corn-based \nsystems, and water quality under changing climate \nconditions. One practice referred to as controlled \ndrainage shows potential to conserve some of the water \nthat is \u201cexcess\u201d in the spring, and hold it so it is available \nlater in the year when crop growth is at its peak and soil \nmoisture cannot keep up with crop water demand. This \npractice also has been studied as a way to reduce the \nnitrate loss into streams and rivers that has been linked \nto water quality problems downstream such as hypoxia \nin the Gulf of Mexico. Holding the water back allows \nwater to flow through longer pathways, and seep into \ndeeper soil layers. \n2.4.1 Water stress on crop \nproduction\nWater use by crops is greatest at the time of their peak \nvegetative biomass, which occurs in July for corn and \nsoybean grown in the upper Midwest. Sensitivity to \nexcess water is not likely to occur during mid-season \n15\nFIGURE 4  |  USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map\nFinding: The change in water table was not seen \nin Iowa, where outlet restriction may have masked \nthis effect, or in Minnesota or Ohio where the water \ntable did not rise near the surface during most \ngrowing seasons. However, the lack of an overall \nresponse in Minnesota is believed to be an artifact \nof the years in which the research was conducted, as \nthese were drier compared to normal. \nImplication: Controlled drainage should not be \nadopted primarily for yield benefits, but yield \nincreases are possible, especially if timely rainfall \nevents provide water for crop uptake and with active \nmanagement of the outlet height. Lowering the \noutlet before storm events would reduce the amount \nof time the water table is at a level that could be \ndetrimental to trafficability or crop yield.\nFinding: Corn yield was correlated with soil \nmoisture stress, particularly excess soil moisture \nstress or the absolute sum of excess and deficit stress.\nImplication: Although soil moisture stress impacts \nyield, the impact of controlled drainage on soil \nmoisture in most site-years is minimal. More \nresearch is needed on the yield reduction associated \nwith excess moisture stress that may be associated \nwith managing the controlled drainage outlet height \ntoo high, especially in specific crop development \nphases and on optimum strategies for managing the \noutlet. \nFinding: Long-term implementation of highly \nproductive continuous corn systems with all \nresidues left after harvest improved soil water \nretention in the upper soil profile (at 0-10 and 10-20 \ncm depths) compared to corn-soybean and corn-\nsoybean-wheat rotations in Wisconsin. \nImplication: Changes in soil water retention may \nbe observable among different cropping systems, \nhowever, the reasons for this difference are not clear. \nThis may be a byproduct of lower inherent crop \nproductivity from continuous corn compared to \nhigher yielding rotations, and/or cooler and wetter \nsoils from the thick residue cover.\n2.4.2 Future climate and drain flow\nFinding based on modeling: By late 21st century, \nsubsurface drainage volume is projected to decrease \nin NW Ohio (Hardiness Zone 6; see Figure 4). This \nis primarily attributed to increased evaporation as a \nresult of increased temperature. For a description of \nthe model parameters used to generate this finding, \nrefer to Appendix C.2.\nImplication: Farmers in this eastern Corn Belt \nregion are expected to begin developing irrigation \nstrategies to meet growing season crop water \nrequirements.\nRecommendation: Farmers in NW Ohio should \nmove forward aggressively to adopt controlled \ndrainage and recycling systems to assist in managing \nwater resources as a way to ensure adequate water \nfor future cropping systems.\nFinding based on modeling: Under future climate \nscenarios, controlled drainage is shown to offer \nsimilar reduction in drainage volume and nitrate \nload to streams as observed under current climate.\nImplication: Controlled drainage is one of the most \neffective tools to reduce off-site delivery of nutrients \ncarried in subsurface drainage water.\nRecommendation: Educational and policy efforts \nthat encourage farmer adoption and use of drainage \nwater management principles, especially controlled \ndrainage, can reduce nitrate loads to streams in the \nfuture.\nFinding based on modeling: Subsurface drainage \nvolume is expected to increase throughout the Corn \nBelt into mid-21st century with the greatest increase \nin Hardiness Zones 4 and 5. These increases largely \nare driven by decreases in frost depth and duration, \nresulting from increased temperature and a modest \nincrease in precipitation. For description of models \nused to generate these findings, see Appendix C.3.\nImplication: Farmers will continue to intensify \nsubsurface drainage infrastructure in order to \nminimize excessive soil wetness. Greater drain \nflow may result in more overloading of county and \ndistrict drainage systems, leading to longer times \nto drain the fields. Greater overall drain flow also \nwould be expected to increase nitrate loads to \nreceiving water bodies. \nImplication: Farmers should incorporate drainage \nwater management principles and infrastructure \nwhen designing and installing subsurface drainage \nsystems.\nFinding based on modeling: The proportion of \ndrainage occurring before May 31 will increase \nVol. 2 Climate & Managing Corn-Soybean Agroecosystems s 16\nprimarily in the more northern portions of the Corn \nBelt. An increase in percent winter drainage was \nsimulated in USDA Hardiness Zones of:\n\u2022 2 to 14% increase in parts of zones 3, 4 and 5 (refer \nto Figure 4)\n\u2022 10 to 25% increase in the southern part of zone 4 \n\u2022 0 to 5% increase in the southern part of zone 5 and \nall of zone 6\nThese projected increases are driven both by \nincreases in winter precipitation of 10 to 14% across \nportions of zones 3-5 and 7 to 10% across zones 5-6, \nas well as decreases in frost depth. The northern \nportion of the region (zones 3-5) will experience a \nlarger decrease in frost depth (15 to 23%) compared \nto the southern portion of the region (zones 5-6; \n12 to 18%). Refer to Appendix C.4 for model \nparameters. \nImplication: A greater proportion of drain flow \noccurring during the non-growing season may \nincrease the ability of controlled drainage to reduce \nannual nitrate load.\nFinding based on modeling: The depth of drain \nflow retained by controlled drainage will increase \nby 0 to 20 mm across most of the Corn Belt, but \nthe percentage of annual drain flow retained with \ncontrol drainage is essentially unchanged. Refer to \nAppendix C.4 for model parameters. \nImplication: Controlled drainage can help mitigate \nthe increase in drainage and associated nitrate \nload in the future, but it will not be able to reduce \ndrainage by a greater proportion than it does \ncurrently.\n2.4.3 Water quality under changing \nweather conditions\nFinding based on modeling: Cropland contributes \nmore than 70% of total N and 50% of P loads within \nthe Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB) and \nOhio-Tennessee River Basin (OTRB). Refer to \nAppendix C.5 for model parameters. \nImplication: Agriculture is a key source of sediment \nand nutrient pollution to Corn Belt streams. The \nadoption of cover crops, no-till and other best \nmanagement practices by farmers can reduce \nthe losses of these pollutants based on scenario \nsimulation results. \nFinding based on modeling: Large sediment and \nnutrient reductions could occur for the UMRB and \nOTRB regions in response to widespread adoption \nof no-till, cover crops or extended rotations for \nboth current baseline and future climate conditions. \nThe effectiveness of no-till, extended rotations with \nalfalfa and a rye cover crop were similar in reducing \nsediment, total P, total N or nitrate for current \nclimate conditions (1981 to 2010) versus future mid-\ncentury climate conditions (2046 to 2065). Refer to \nAppendix C.5 for model used. \nRecommendation: Adoption of no-till, cover crops \nand/or extended rotations (with alfalfa or other \nintegrated non-cash crops) should be pursued across \nthe Corn Belt region to improve regional water \nquality and reduce the northern Gulf of Mexico \nhypoxic zone for both current and future climate \nconditions.\nFinding based on modeling: Adoption of a rye \ncover crop on all land in corn-soybean production \nin the OTRB resulted in a reduction of total N that \nwas nearly 20% greater under future mid-century \n(2046 to 2065) climate than the cover crop effects in \nresponse to current climate (1981 to 2010). Refer to \nAppendix C.5 for model used.\n17\nGraduate student Lindsay Pease, The Ohio State University, \nchecks water quality collection equipment at an on-farm \nresearch site.\nImplication: Under predicted future climate, nitrate \nloss to drainage water, N2O emissions and soil loss \nare likely to increase relative to current conditions. \nAdding a cereal rye cover crop is expected to help \nlessen this loss but will not eliminate it entirely.\n2.5 NITROGEN SYSTEM\nThe majority of N in soil systems is in organic \ncompounds that are not available directly to plants and \nmust be converted to ammonium and eventually nitrate \n(inorganic-N forms), or provided through biological \nsymbiotic N fixation. Application of N fertilizer is a key \ninput to corn production in the upper Midwest that \ncomplements biological N fixation (BNF) as well as \nmicrobial transformation of soil organic matter nitrogen \nto inorganic-N. The amount and rate of microbial \ntransformation of soil organic matter (SOM)-N to \ninorganic-N is highly influenced by environmental \nconditions (e.g. temperature and precipitation). \nThus, the requirement for supplementary N fertilizer \napplication is highly variable from year-to-year and \nfield-to-field. \nResearch by the Sustainable Corn CAP team has focused \non better understanding the interaction between climate \nand the N cycle and how system diversification to \ninclude cover crops and inclusion of a third crop can \nimpact N loss via nitrous oxide (greenhouse gas) and as \nnitrate leaching into water bodies. \n2.5.1 Greenhouse gas: Nitrous \noxide\nNitrogen fertilizer rate and weather are the two \ndominant factors affecting nitrous oxide (N2O) \nemissions from corn fields. Although agriculture \naccounts for a relatively small proportion \n(approximately 8%; USEPA 2015) of total U.S. \ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, approximately \ntwo-thirds of emissions from the agricultural \nsector are due to N2O that is emitted from \nnitrogen fertilizer applications. With a warming \npotential of about 300 times that of carbon \ndioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide is among the most \neffective heat trapping gases in the atmosphere \nand therefore, of research importance. The \nSustainable Corn CAP team was interested in \nhow management may reduce N2O emissions \nwhile being practical and implementable by farmers. \nImprovements can be made in several areas to reduce \ndenitrification and nitrification that lead to N2O \nemissions. If this is accomplished, emissions are likely to \ndecrease in the current and potentially future climate.\nFinding: Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions were \nreduced 60% by sensor-based N sidedress \napplications compared to standard pre-plant N \nmanagement in Missouri. This reduction was due to \ndelayed timing, since all N2O reductions occurred \nduring the period before sidedress N was applied. \nImplication: Cost-share practices to encourage \nsidedress or split N applications will help to reduce \nN2O emissions from corn, which is the biggest \ncomponent of corn\u2019s greenhouse gas footprint. \nFinding: N2O emissions in Missouri were highly \nresponsive to weather, and were much higher under \nvery wet conditions in 2013-2015 and lower during \ndrought in 2012.\nImplication: N losses can be somewhat mitigated by \nimproved weather prediction and application \nmethods that increase nitrogen use efficiency. \nContinuing to develop strategies that better match \nfertilizer application rates with crop needs may \nreduce N2O emission in the upper Midwest.\nFinding: The use of specific management \npractices can avoid cover crop-induced increases \nin N2O emissions. Mechanical termination and \nincorporation of cover crops into the soil tends \nto increase N2O emissions by more than 150% \ncompared to herbicide termination without \nincorporation into the soil.\nPVC rings installed in a corn field. \nGreenhouse gas (GHG) collection chambers \nare placed onto the rings to take GHG \nmeasurements.\nImplication: The impact of cover crops on nitrate \nloss may reduce downstream N2O emissions. Cover \ncrops should be managed for these benefits, while \nalso considering practices that minimize N2O \nemissions, such as using herbicides for termination \nwithout incorporation into the soil.\nFinding: Legume cover crops tend to increase \nN2O emissions after termination and during \ndecomposition, but have less N2O emissions while \nthe cover crop is growing. When N2O emissions \nare monitored year-round, the effect of cover crops \n(legumes, grasses or mixtures) on N2O is close to \nzero.\nImplication: Monitoring N2O emissions in late fall \nand winter is important when comparing systems \naffected by time, such as with and without cover \ncrops, despite their potential small effect on total \nannual N2O emissions.\nFinding based on modeling: Model studies \nindicate a cereal rye cover crop provides substantial \nenvironmental benefits in a corn-soybean rotation \nby reducing nitrate loss to drainage water, nitrous \noxide emissions and soil loss across the Midwest \nregion, without significant yield loss. \nImplication: Under predicted future climate, a \ncereal rye cover crop is expected to yield larger \nreductions in nitrate loss to drainage water, N2O \nemissions and soil loss relative to current conditions.\n2.5.2 Nitrogen fertilizer \napplications\nResearch conducted in Missouri and Ohio compared \nstandard pre-plant application of nitrogen fertilizer at a \nfixed rate to variable-rate sidedress nitrogen using crop \nsensors installed on fertilizer applicators. These practices \nneed continued research efforts to account for a wider \nspectrum of variables affecting nitrogen use efficiency for \nthe crop and system as a whole. An integrated approach \nneeds to be continued with emphasis on soil type, crop \nrotation, and interaction with weather. \nFinding: Sensor-based N side dressing gave the \nhighest yields in Missouri while lowering nitrogen \nuse, but under-recommended N applications in \nOhio; sensor height above the crop is hypothesized \nto account for differences in findings. See Appendix \nC.6 for equipment application details. \nImplication: Sensor-based N side dressing has \nthe potential to produce both production and \nenvironmental benefits, but needs additional \ndevelopment to produce these benefits reliably. \nImplication: Total N off-field, off-farm loss as \nnitrate and N2O is anticipated to increase under \nfuture climate scenarios. Split-applications of N have \npotential to be an important management tool to \nmaintain yield and limit N loss that may result from \nincreased amounts and intensity of spring rainfall. \n21\nSENSORS\nOptimal nitrogen fertilizer rate \nvaries widely within a field. Using \nequipment to sense nitrogen needs \nin the corn canopy while applying N \nfertilizer is a promising approach to \ndiagnose and treat the variation in \nreal time. Two sensors are mounted \non either side of the tractor, in \nfront. A computer in the cab reads \nthe sensors, calculates N rate and \ndirects the controller to apply a \nparticular rate of fertilizer.\nVol. 2 Climate & Managing Corn-Soybean Agroecosystems s 20\n2.6 CARBON SYSTEM\nChanges in soil organic carbon (SOC) content are \nslow to become evident in the short time frame of this \nproject (2011 to 2015). An increase in SOC content, \nwhich is the goal of C sequestration, also is difficult in \nannual cropping systems with significant difference \noccurring in sequestration potential across the region. \nContinued focus and priority placed on soil conservation \nand improving soil quality/health are critical for land \nstewardship and long-term productivity. Increased \nSOC content in the soil results in many benefits such as \nincreased water retention and nutrient cycling. Higher \nSOC content results in higher crop yields (see Figure 5), \nwhich is another motivating factor for farmers to place \npriority on this. \nFinding: The SOC content across experimental sites \ntended to be influenced more by tillage practice \nthan by cover crop or N management. No-till \nmanagement helped to maintain soil C in a corn-\nsoybean system, but when tilled the soil C declined, \nalthough erosion may have been a contributor to \nthis decline.\nData are presented here on the plot-level from 23 Sustainable Corn CAP \nresearch sites in 8 states. The inherent productivity of corn is related to \na soil\u2019s carbon content with an upward trend in yield as SOC increases. \nVariation in SOC within and across states is one factor influencing crop \nyields with weather and management as additional factors. Strategies \nthat aim to increase a soil\u2019s carbon content is a valuable, long-term \ninvestment especially when paired with other conservation practices.  \nFIGURE 5  |  Relationship between \npercent soil organic carbon (SOC) \nand corn grain yield, 2011-2015.\nImplication: Eliminating tillage is an important step \nin maintaining the existing SOC content of a soil \nwhen other management practices are held constant. \nFinding: Four years of cereal rye cover crop \nintegrated into a corn-soybean system did not \nsignificantly increase SOC at most of the cover crop \nsites across the region. \nImplication: Although cover crops are known to \nadd additional C back to the soil, this is a long-\nterm investment. Based on project experiments, \nmore than four years of cereal rye cover crops are \nnecessary before a significant increase in SOC \nbecomes measurable.\nFinding: Four years of cereal rye cover crop did not \nsignificantly affect soil bulk density or soil water \nretention curves at most of the cover crop sites \nacross the region.\nImplication: Soil physical properties such as bulk \ndensity and water retention curves are slow to \nchange, and cover crops are not likely to significantly \nimpact these properties over the short term.\nFinding: In Indiana, there was greater cereal rye \ncover crop biomass in general compared to other \nSustainable Corn CAP research sites because of \nmore favorable weather conditions for growth. After \nfour years of cereal rye cover crop at the Indiana \nsite, the wet soil aggregate stability was significantly \ngreater in the top 20 cm (8 inches) of a silt loam soil.\nImplication: Cover crops can improve soil \nstructure, which can lead to reduced soil crusting \nand erosion and increased water infiltration with \ntime.\n21\nFinding: Analysis of in-depth farmer interviews \nidentified an emergent construct of a \u201csoil \nstewardship ethic\u201d that helps explain why and \nhow some farmers are actively enhancing their \nsoil resources as a way to adapt to more variable \nand extreme weather. Farmers who articulated \nthis soil stewardship ethic were attempting to shift \nfrom short-term reactivity to seasonal weather \nvariability toward intentional management of their \nsoil resources to build longer-term resilience of \ntheir farm operations. In other words, farmers\u2019 \nsoil stewardship ethics appear to be helping them \nbridge short-term profit imperatives and long-\nterm sustainability goals (Roesch-McNally et al. In \nrevision).\nFinding: This research provided empirical \nevidence the increased emphasis that agencies and \norganizations such as the USDA NRCS and the \nUnited Nations are placing on soils and soil health \nis resonating with farmers, and is likely to continue \nto be well-received by Corn Belt farmers (Roesch-\nMcNally et al, (in revision)).\nImplication: Engaging farmers in conversations \nabout soil stewardship may be an effective way to \nencourage them to adopt conservation practices, \nparticularly if the practices both build soil health \nand help to reduce weather-related risks on their \nfarm. \nRecommendation: Further research is needed on \nfarmers\u2019 soil stewardship ethics, and how better \nunderstanding of soil stewardship ethics can be \nintegrated into climate risk reduction efforts.\nRecommendation: Interdisciplinary research \nopportunities should engage farmers in field-level \nresearch to assess whether farmers who express \nattitudes associated with the soil stewardship ethic \nare actually improving soil resources on their farms \nthrough the adoption and use of conservation \npractices.\nVol. 2 Climate & Managing Corn-Soybean Agroecosystems s 22\nsection 3. Conclusions\nRealizing the potential of corn-based cropping systems to meet the food, feed, fuel, and fiber \nneeds of a growing global population under changing \nclimatic conditions will require the integration of \nadvanced genetics (G), better understanding of the \nenvironment (E), and knowledge and motivation to \nmanage differently (M) (Hatfield and Walthall. 2015). \nThe research of the Sustainable Corn CAP informs the \ninteractions among E x M to better understand the \nnitrogen, carbon, and water cycles and their systems \nrelationships. \nField experimentation, statistical models, and \nbiophysical models point to the effects that variability \nin weather-climate and farmer management practices \nhave on crop yield, water use efficiency, beneficial \nand harmful insects, sediment and nitrate loads, soil \nwater retention, and nitrous oxide (N20) emissions. \nCover crops, no-till, and controlled drainage show \npromise in improving components of the N, C, and \nwater cycles, but are not sufficient alone to stabilize \nand increase yields while solving unintended \nenvironmental concerns associated with cultivated \nsystems. Project findings reinforce there are no \nsingle or simple solutions to improving yields under \nchanging climate, while simultaneously protecting \nand managing water resources, reducing off-field, \noff-farm N loss, retaining and enhancing soil carbon \nstocks, and ensuring farm livelihoods. \nManagement is a critical factor in realizing the full \npotential of the corn-based system and must not be \ntreated as a \u201cblack box\u201d variable in the G x E x M \nanalysis. Studying the biophysical impacts differing \nmanagement practices have, in addition to social \nscience research regarding factors associated with \nhuman management decision-making under variable \nconditions, allows validation of assumptions and \ndevelopment of a robust structure for understanding \nG x E x M system interactions. It is essential individual \nand public policy-level decisions are based on data \nand models that incorporate the impacts of a suite of \nmanagement practices and the capability and willingness \nof land managers and farmers to tailor practices to their \nown unique situations. There are many constraints to co-\nproducing high quality crops with increasing grain yields \nand essential soil, water and other ecosystem services \nagriculture and society needs now and in the future \n(Hatfield and Walthall 2015). Future research must \ncontinue to push the boundaries of system-level science \nand engage transdisciplinary teams, if these constraints \nare to be understood and overcome.\nThis multi-state and transdisciplinary Sustainable Corn \nCAP project advanced biophysical and social-economic \nresearch in the discovery of scientifically proven field, \nfarm, and landscape level results for dual benefits to the \nfarm enterprise and the environment. These goals are \nnot in opposition and the discoveries from this project \nwill continue to pave the agriculture scientific frontier \nas we seek to improve the resiliency and sustainability \nof our main production systems in the upper Midwest. \nThose directly involved in farming and those who \nact as consumers in the agricultural value chain are \nmutually interested in sustainability, resiliency, and the \nlong-term assurance of safe and affordable sources of \nfood, feed, fiber, and fuel. The Sustainable Corn CAP \nresearch findings presented in Volume 1 and Volume 2 \nsummarize major outcomes from this five-year project \nduring the 2011-2016 grant period. These volumes are \nonly a snapshot of project findings. Although this project \nofficially ended February 28, 2017, we anticipate analyses \nand simulations based on project data will continue with \nresults published several years into the future. \nsection 4. supporting scientific publications\nRefereed Journals\nRefereed Journals not included in Volume 1 are listed \nbelow.

All of \nthe available GCMs from Phase Five of the Coupled \nModel Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) that had \nbeen downscaled for the contiguous United States \nwere employed. Downscaled projections were obtained \nfrom the \u201cDownscaled CMIP3 and CMIP5 Climate \nand Hydrology Projections\u201d archive at http://gdo-dcp.\nucllnl.org/downscaled_cmip_projections (Maurer et al. \n2007). Projections were bias-corrected and statistically \ndownscaled to a daily time scale and to 1/8\u00b0 spatial \nresolution (about 140 square kilometers per grid cell) \nusing the Bias-Correction Constructed Analogues \n(BCCA) method (Bureau of Reclamation 2013). The \ngrid cell used in this study was centered at 40\u00b0 33\u2019 45\u201d \nN, 84\u00b0 3\u2019 45\u201d W. This study examined changes in the \nagricultural water balance under two future radiative \nforcing scenarios known as representative concentration \npathways (RCPs). RCP 4.5 represents a climate scenario \nin which global population stabilizes at nine billion, and \nglobal emissions reduction policies lead to a peak in \nGHG emissions by 2050 with a decline to stable levels by \n2080. RCP 8.5 represents a \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d climate \nscenario in which global population increases to 12 \nbillion by 2100 with no significant global climate policies \nto reduce GHG emissions (Moss et al. 2008). Using this \nmethod, 19 and 20 GCMs were available for RCP 4.5 and \n8.5, respectively.\nTable.

The A2 \nscenario describes a greater increase in greenhouse gas \nemissions by mid-century associated with a continuously \ngrowing world population, while the B1 scenario \nrepresents moderate increases in total emissions by mid-\ncentury. These increases are largely driven by increases \nin winter and annual precipitation. Simulations based on \nthe A1B emissions scenario which represents balanced \nenergy use and total emissions in between the other two \nscenarios by mid-century predict decreases in annual \ndrainage in parts of Minnesota. \nAppendix C.4. \nFor the finding described on page 17, this was based on \nspecific modeling parameters: \nThe findings are based on the average of simulations \ndriven by meteorological data for the A1B emissions \nscenario from one climate model (PCM).\nAppendix C.5. \nFor the findings described on page 17, these were based \non specific modeling parameters:\nThis finding is based on baseline Soil and Water \nAssessment Tool (SWAT) simulation results for the two \nregions: Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB) and \nOhio-Tennessee River Basin (OTRB).\nAppendix C.6. \nFor the finding described on page 19, this was based on \nnitrogen sensors placed on tractors that are above the \ncrop. Sensor height is the most likely explanation for the \ndifference in performance between the nitrogen fertilizer \nrecommendations for the two states. Sensors were 50 \ncm above plants in Missouri, but 80 cm above plants in \nOhio; the latter was likely too far away from plants to \ndistinguish their N status.\nVol. 2 Climate & Managing Corn-Soybean Agroecosystems s 38\n\n\nThe Climate and Corn-based Cropping Systems CAP (Sustainable Corn CAP) is a USDA-NIFA supported program, Award No. \n2011-68002-30190.

The exceptional circumstances that justify \nthis extension are the need to fund graduate student and other personnel positions whose hiring \nwas delayed by: 1) execution of 10 subcontracts, 2) Year 1 hiring lag time in position \nannouncements and completion of hiring processes for technical and managerial staff, and 3) \ndelay between project start time and graduate student Y1 Fall semester admissions and beginning \nof employment. Specifically, our project entailed ten subcontracts with 9 universities and 2 with \nARS. This process took approximately three months, with the last contract finalized mid-June, \n2011. Technical and managerial staff positions were not filled until 3-6 months\u2019 post project start \ndate, thus accumulating almost six month\u2019s salary in some cases. Lastly, graduate student \ntraining and education in research, extension, and education is a central component of this \nproject. A March 2011 start date allowed for graduate student recruitment; however most of \nthese graduate students were not available to start their program of study until the start of fall \n2011 semester or in some cases January 2012 semester. This resulted in a five to nine month \ndelay in the use of student personnel budget.  \n \nFunding to be carried forward. Based on funds remaining as of Sept. 1, 2015 and projected \ncosts for the remaining six months of Year 5, we anticipate approximately $900,000 will be \ncarried forward into the requested one year, no cost extension period. Of that total approximately \n$608,000 will be for direct costs and approximately $292,000 for associated indirect costs at \nIowa State University.  \n \nY6 No Cost Extension Proposed Scope of Work \nThe scope of work for the Climate and Corn-based Cropping Systems Coordinated Agricultural \nProject (CSCAP) as originally proposed and funded entails: 1) sampling measurements at 35 \nfield sites and data entered into the database; 2) synthesis and modeling of primary and \nsecondary data and publications of findings in scientific outlets; 3) cross-disciplinary integration \nand knowledge exchanges of data and findings to address more complex human-natural system \nresearch questions; 4) development of recommendations and extension of scientific findings to \nextension educators, farmers, policymakers, agricultural sector, and science educators; and, 5) \ncompletion of the graduate education of project students and guidance into the next phases of \ntheir careers. The extension of the project performance does not change the original scope of \nwork for the project as detailed above. The no cost extension for Y6 request will allow the \ncompletion of the following scope of work tasks:  \n1) Complete field site data entry, quality review, and preparation for deposition into the \nUSDA National Agricultural Library for public access;  \n2) Synthesis and modeling of data with priority given to answering coupled human-natural \nsystem questions and publication of findings; and  \n3) Completion of the graduate education of 14 graduate students whose course of work \nand research extend beyond February 2016.  \n \nFunds to accomplish these tasks will primarily be used to cover salary expenditures including \ngraduate students and database personnel (~$800,000). The remaining balance (~$100,000) will \nbe used for page costs and open access for selected publications, and also for a few travel \nexpenses related to workgroup preparation for these publications. \n2 \n \nSpecifically: \n1. Complete field site data entry, quality review, and preparation for deposition into the \nUSDA National Agricultural Library for public access. Most of Y5 field samples will be \nprocessed and data entered into the central database by Feb. 2016, the end of Y5. In Y6, \nthe data team will finalize the central database, continue to work closely with the project \nteam to prepare data for analysis, synthesis and modeling, and prepare all data for \nexternal release and posting by February 2017. Primary tasks will be: \n1) Continue reviewing data and performing quality control. \n2) Curate metadata and facilitate the entry and/or storage of one-off datasets/metadata. \nComplete development of data libraries to describe metadata, treatments, and measured \ndata to ensure standard interpretation and understanding. \n3) Work with the project research workgroups to provide visualization and statistical \nsupport; answer questions pertaining to existing data sets and data management. \n4) Prepare all data for release and upload to meet open data policies (implemented post-\naward) by populating to USDA National Agricultural Laboratory. \n5) Provide structure and tools for project and data management that are transferable to \nother teams. Continue Y5 work with AgMIP harmonization project data in \nconjunction with NAL structure and tools.  \n6) Provide guidance and recommendations based on project experience to other projects \ncollecting primary data and utilizing standardized protocols and methods. \n7) Help team PIs leverage standardized protocols, database, internal website, and \ninfrastructure in future proposals and projects that extend the legacy of our project \ninvestments.  \n \n2. Synthesis and modeling of data in Y6 will give priority to answering coupled human-\nnatural system questions and publication of findings. The team will have five years of \nproject field data from 35 sites and will continue to publish focused papers on carbon, \nnitrogen, water, human dimensions, climate, and IPM at field, watershed, and regional \nscales. Additional work will integrate two or more of these platforms to examine \ninteractions and tradeoffs when carbon, nitrogen or water benefits and risks are dominant \ngoals. However, a primary effort in Y6 scope of work will build off of Y5 team \nintegration efforts to synthesize the integration of all platforms in ways that \nsimultaneously value social, ecological and productivity goals. Team generated \nrecommendations and supporting data will be further developed for scientific journal \npublication and non-scientific audiences. Two or three workgroups will prepare data and \nwrite themed papers based on integration across all platforms for submission to high \nprofile journals. A special issue on the Sustainability of Corn in the Journal of Soil and \nWater Conservation will also be developed. \n \n3. Completion of the graduate education of 14 graduate students whose course of work \nand research extend beyond the original termination date. A number of our graduate \nstudents will not complete their degree until May, July or December of 2016. These \nstudents will continue their research analyses and write up their findings in Y6 working \nclosely with project PIs. The graduate student leadership initiated plans in Y5 to keep the \nproject graduate student cohort connected; these efforts will continue to be supported in \nY6 as students finish their degrees, seek jobs, and develop their career plans.  \n3 \n \nProject Progress Report \nTeam Accomplishments for Past Year \u2013 PROGRESS OVERVIEW \nThe Climate and Corn-based Cropping Systems Coordinated Agricultural Project (CSCAP) has \ncompleted the following goals which strategically align with the team\u2019s logic model (Appendix \nA) and milestones (Appendix B): 1) Field data. Y1-Y4 sampling measurements at 35 field sites \nare completed and Y5 sampling will be complete by December 2015. Much of Y1-Y4 data are \nentered into the database and Y5 data will be entered by the end of Y5; 2) Substantive progress \non synthesis and modeling of primary and secondary data with 154 papers reporting team \nfindings in scientific outlets to-date (Appendix C and D); 3) Cross-disciplinary integration and \nknowledge exchanges of data and findings to address more complex human-natural system \nresearch questions were accelerated with 35 published papers meeting integration criteria of co-\nauthored by two or more disciplines and institutions; 4) Project-wide recommendations to extend \nscientific findings to extension educators, farmers, policymakers, agricultural sector, and science \neducators were developed. Papers were begun for publication in Y6 and beyond; 5) Graduate \neducation of project students occurred (86 total to-date; Appendix E); with several events \ndesigned to guide them into the next phases of their careers. Project PIs met at the end of Y4 and \nidentified action items needed to complete the project as proposed and to develop a legacy plan \nfor research, extension, and education post project (see Appendix F).  \n \nThe team worked to ensure future science and outreach programming was poised to build on \nwhat the project has learned by strengthening existing while also building out new partnerships \nto leverage and transfer the work of the team such as standardized protocols, research and \nmanagement databases, internal website, field experiments, and inter-transdisciplinary networks \nof value to future proposals and projects. Many Advisory Board members have been highly \nengaged with the team and are working with the team to complete the project and plan for \nsustaining the public investment past the USDA-NIFA funded life of the project. \n \nThe team worked within and across six Objectives and has accomplished these goals: \n1. Developed standardized methodologies and performed baseline monitoring of carbon, \nnitrogen and water footprints at agricultural test sites across the Midwest. \n2. Evaluated how crop management practices impact carbon, nitrogen and water footprints at \ntest sites. \n3. Applied models to research data and climate scenarios to identify impacts and outcomes \nthat could affect the sustainability and economic vitality of corn-based cropping systems. \n4. Gained knowledge of farmer beliefs and concerns about climate change, attitudes toward \nadaptive and mitigative strategies and practices, and decision support needs to inform the \ndevelopment of outreach that supports long-term sustainability of crop production. \n5. Promoted extension, outreach and stakeholder learning and participation across all aspects \nof the program. \n6. Trained the next generation of scientists, developed science education curricula and \npromoted learning opportunities for high school teachers. \n \nCross-disciplinary integration and knowledge exchanges of data and analyses to accelerate \nsynthesis and integration occurred this year. These are highlighted next followed by \naccomplishments for each Objective this past year. The following accomplishments are \n4 \n \ncumulative (Y1-Y5): outputs, outcomes/impacts, milestones and deliverables, broad \nimpacts, student training, and concluding statements. \n \nTeam Accomplishments for Past Year \u2013 CROSS-DISCIPLINARY INTEGRATION AND \nKNOWLEDGE EXCHANGES \nAlthough the milestones are organized around a set of project objectives, our work is about \nunderstanding systems\u2014specifically the carbon, nitrogen, water and human-social systems that \nunderpin the management of corn-soybean production systems and their interactive responses to \nvariable climate and weather conditions. This requires a high level of multi-disciplinary and \nstakeholder integration through project management and systematic efforts by our \ntransdisciplinary team to purposefully connect our disciplinary knowledge, theories and data in \nways that allow us to answer some of the difficult science questions associated with managing \ncorn-based cropping systems (see project Logic Model, Appendix A). Across-team integration \ngoals accomplished were: 1) acceleration of synthesis and modeling of primary and secondary \ndata and published findings in scientific outlets; 2) increased cross-disciplinary integration and \nknowledge exchanges of data and findings to address more complex human-natural system \nresearch questions; and, 3) developed recommendations and moved scientific findings to \napplications for use by extension educators, farmers, policymakers, other groups in the \nagricultural sector, as well as science educators. \n \nTo accomplish the project goals, we continued the successful processes from past years that are \nbearing fruit and pushed forward to complete collection of all primary data (biophysical and \nsocial economic) with intent to finalize the project database; intensified cross-disciplinary efforts \nto conduct primary and regional analyses, synthesis, and modeling; and published the science of \nthe team for scientific and non-scientific audiences.  \n \nWhole-team integration tasks accomplished include: \na) The project database. Objectives 1-4 collected, cleaned and prepared project primary data \nfor analysis and actively interfaced with the database team to assure data were in the database \nby end of Y5;  \nb) An integration team comprised of Objective point persons was formed to accelerate \nintegration of disciplinary knowledge, theories, data and findings across Objectives and C, N, \nwater, and stakeholder platforms. This cohort developed a vision for integration and prepared \na plan for within and across objective integration including preparation for the August 2015 \nannual team meeting, development of the annual meeting agenda, and post-annual meeting \nfollow-up. \nc) Team workgroups synthesized findings and recommendations in prep for the annual \nmeeting specific to experimental treatments (drainage management, cover crops, tillage, \nextended crop rotations, greenhouse gases, nitrogen rate and timing, soil quality index, pests, \nclimate change and yield, landscape soil-water, social economic, extension legacy, education \nrecommendations for teachers, project management, research data management) (see 119 \nworking draft recommendations, Appendix H); \nd) Whole team integration of C, N, Water, and stakeholder platforms utilized \nmonthly/bimonthly meetings and the annual meeting to synthesize and develop \nrecommendations. Preliminary findings and plans for writing papers were presented, and \nworkgroups actively identified cross-cutting themes and integration opportunities. These \n5 \n \nmeetings accelerated exchange of theories; proposals to test hypotheses; analyses and \nsyntheses of data; and the writing and publication of science findings;  \ne) Fifty-nine recommendations and 17 highly integrated recommendations were generated at \nthe two-day annual meeting where workgroups shared findings and recommendations and \nsmall and large group discussion led to synthesis and further development. These \nrecommendations are developed for C, N, Water, and stakeholders at the field, watershed, \nand regional scales (see Appendix H, working draft of team recommendations).  \nf) Priority recommendations to focus Y5 and Y6 development of integration publications \nwere identified after the annual meeting using post-conference survey evaluation by team \nmembers and employing a Delphi method to rate and rank items. Four integration \npublications were identified with writing groups formed around these to assemble supporting \ndata and write these publications. \ng) Project extension educators attended research workgroups to participate in discussions \nfocused on findings and recommendations to create more active feedback loops between \nresearch, extension, and education so that scientific findings have strong farmer applicability; \nh) Products for non-scientific audiences have been completed and continue to be developed \nwhich communicate key scientific findings about soil (carbon), climate, crop rotations, water \nmanagement and tillage to extension and education audiences; \ni) Recommendations to guide future Extension and outreach directors in climate and \nagriculture programming are being prepared for publication; and include strategies and \ntechniques for working with extension educators, agricultural advisors and intermediaries, \nfarm media, farmers, and science teachers; and,  \nj) CSCAP Advisory Board explored with PIs potential mechanisms and partnerships to \nleverage and transfer the work of the team post-project (e.g., Midwest Climate Hub, North \nCentral Region Experiment Station directors, NA Climate Smart Agriculture, industry-\nuniversity-ARS consortia). These efforts will continue into Y6. \n \nCommunication Accomplishments \nThe team website (www.sustainablecorn.org) had an increase in number of unique visitors this \nyear (up 16%) with 31,516 page views. We initiated an effort to make our informational and \ninstructional products available to target audiences (farmers, agricultural advisors, Extension \neducators and high school teachers) now and after the project ends. Sixty of our fact sheets, \nwhite papers, the Resilient Agriculture magazine and our videos are now available at the Iowa \nState University Extension online store (search keywords, such as \u201cclimate change\u201d and \u201ccover \ncrops\u201d). Prior to Feb 2016, we will be working to expand this effort to other state-based \nExtension online stores. Other efforts to increase communications this past year with key \nexternal target audiences include: \n\u2022 Ongoing blogposts made bi-weekly on current topics through partnership with U2U. \n\u2022 Ongoing Twitter messaging made several times/week. Target audience is farmers and \nagricultural advisors. \n\u2022 Ongoing YouTube channel where all the project videos for public viewing including new \nvideos highlighting graduate student research.  \n\u2022 Distribution of our \u201cResilient Agriculture\u201d magazine at conferences and workshops. \n\u2022 A news release publicizing the team\u2019s special issue of the Journal of Soil and Water \nConservation. \n6 \n \n\u2022 Project research published in practitioner and farmer magazines including The \nProgressive Farmer and CSA (Crops, Soils Agronomy) News. \n \nPast Year Accomplishments\u2013 OBJECTIVES 1 & 2 SPECIFIC \nAccomplishments for Objectives 1 & 2 focused on building upon prior years\u2019 collaborative work \nwithin topic subgroups associated with field trial experiments (cover crops, drainage water \nmanagement, organic systems, tillage management, nitrogen management, extended rotations, \nand integrated pest management), the final year collection of field research data across the 35 \nCSCAP research network sites, transmittal of data into the central database, integration meetings \nwith Objective 3-5 members, and preparation of regional publications synthesizing data across \nthe CSCAP network. These accomplishments align with project milestones (Appendix B).  \nSpecifically: \na) Continued to virtually meet within subgroups monthly to review and synthesize data \nacross research sites;  \nb) Completed research experiments and gathered final year of data from field measurements \nincluding high intensity of soil measurements (same as Y1), laboratory analysis, and quality \ncontrol of data for entry into the central database;  \nc) Worked with database team to have individual research site data and supporting metadata \nentered, questions addressed, and ready for use as a complete dataset once Y5 data is entered; \nd) Reviewed, analyzed and synthesized data across years to identify emerging management \npractices, weather conditions, and soil properties that appear to be particularly influential on \ngreenhouse gas emissions, agronomic productivity, soil quality and health, pest pressures, \nand overall carbon, nitrogen, and water footprints of these cropping systems. Synthesis is \noccurring within workgroups on a temporal and spatial scale that is producing findings and \nrecommendations of high impact for the scientific community; \ne) Completion of the Soil Quality Index (SQI) model based on field data. Evaluate how well \nthis assesses soil quality, improved management practices, and crop yield. \nf) Extend findings and knowledge outward from the field and laboratory to farmers \nassociated with the project directly and by partnering with Obj. 5 members; and, \ng) Produced innovative publications that synthesize across the region, add to the literature \nand translate regional differences; this has been (and will continue to be) a function of \nworking across disciplines in Obj. 1&2, Obj. 3, Obj. 4, and Obj. 5. \n \nPast Year Accomplishments \u2013 OBJECTIVE 3 SPECIFIC \nAccomplishments for Obj. 3 included ongoing synthesis and modeling of CSCAP data gathered \nduring Y1-Y5, continued collaborative and integrative work with Obj. 1 & 2 practice-based \nsubgroups to capture regional and future performance of systems, improved functionality and \nsupport of the central database, and integration of socioeconomic and climate data into datasets \nfor modeling and analysis. These accomplishments align with project milestones (Appendix B). \nSpecifically: \na) Continued to meet virtually on a monthly basis within Obj. 3; \nb) Data team personnel met in DC with USDA National Ag Library, AgMIP, USDA-NIFA \nfunded CAPs, and USDA ARS personnel for small workshop focused on integration and \nharmonization across biophysical data and models for greater utility and determination of \nnext steps;  \n7 \n \nc) Developed calibration practices necessary for model predictive robustness under current \nand future climate; future impact prediction robustness requires a wide range of calibration \nconditions;  \nd) Created spatial layers using NASS crop data layers and SSURGO soils data for proceeding \nwith SALUS model simulations of the entire Midwest;  \ne) Connected landscape water transport and quality modeling efforts with socioeconomic \ndata from the HUC6 hydrologic units; \nf) Continued economic modeling to examine implications of conservation practices on cost \nand necessary economic incentives to meet nutrient reduction goals across the upper \nMississippi; \ng) Continued to develop life cycle assessment (LCA) models using site data to evaluate \nmanagement practices at all sites and to identify trade-offs across the range of life cycle \nimpact categories; and \nh) Continued to integrate climate model projections into the team\u2019s modeling in order to \nevaluate the impacts of management practices under future climate projections, with focus on \nmid-century (ca. 2050). \n \nPast Year Accomplishments \u2013 OBJECTIVE 4 SPECIFIC \nAccomplishments for Obj. 4 centered on social science research and (1) continued analysis of \nthe quantitative and qualitative data collected in Y1-3, (2) dissemination of information, \nespecially through the CSCAP Obj. 5 extension network, and (3) development of a white paper \nfor extension administrators in close partnership with USDA U2U (Useful to Useable) project. \nPublications and presentations have improved understanding of farmer perspectives on climate \nchange and adaptive and mitigative action. Dissemination of social science findings and \nrecommendations have informed the work of scientists, natural resource and agricultural \nprofessionals, and policy makers; strengthened the transdisciplinary linkages with other project \nObjectives; and, offered continued support for the learning partnerships with extension educators \nand farmers in nine Corn Belt states. These accomplishments align with project milestones \n(Appendix B). \nSpecifically: \na) The interview transcript database from in-depth interviews of 159 farmers was structured \nand coded thematically to evaluate farmer perspectives on project emphasis practices (e.g., \ncover crops, nutrient management) to complement farmer survey data analysis; \nb) Analyzed and synthesized in-depth interviews to prepare papers for two dissertations and \nscientific journal publications; \nc) Analyzed data from the Y2 random sample survey of 4,778 Corn Belt farmers from 22 \nHUC6 watersheds across 11 states including joint work with USDA Useful to Useable (U2U) \nproject were used for four CSCAP graduate student dissertation chapters and publications; \nd) Wide dissemination of Farmer Statistical Atlas Vol. I which continues to be one of the \nmost popular destinations on the team website (report downloaded 918 times by users); a \nFarmer Statistical Atlas Vol. II with U2U as lead was published based on Y2 farmer survey; \nd) Survey data were prepared for submission to the project database by end of Y5 including \npreparation of codebooks for future use of data, assurance of quality control and \nconfidentiality including removal of any identifying data;  \ne) Objectives 4 and 5 met with U2U scientists to develop content and structure of a white \npaper for the North Central Region LGU extension leadership that synthesizes the social \n8 \n \nscience of the two projects and lessons learned from extension. The intention of this paper is \nto help guide more robust Extension climate and agriculture programming post USDA \nprojects.  \nf) Outreach strategies and materials were developed in partnerships with Obj. 5 extension \neducators and farmers including fact sheets and extension presentations in each state. \n \nPast Year Accomplishments \u2013 OBJECTIVE 5 SPECIFIC \nAccomplishments of Obj. 5, the project extension and outreach team, were 1) continued work \nwith farmer groups, one-on-one data gathering and discussions with farmers\u2019 about their \nproduction systems and changes from 2012 to 2015, 2) second-round survey of 159 project \nfarmers\u2019 perceptions, practices, and responses to changing climate, 3) state-specific field days \nand crop management meetings to convey science findings and recommendations, and 4) white \npaper developed jointly with U2U for NC LGU administrators on extension lessons learned in \nconveying climate science to agricultural stakeholders. Presentations by Marilyn Thelen, \nMichigan State University, and Hans Schmitz, Purdue University, to our advisory board \nhighlighted potential of successfully integrating climate into agricultural programming. These \naccomplishments align with project milestones (Appendix B). \nSpecifically:  \na) Carried out series of locally adapted presentations to extend project information, most \noften focusing on cover crops, nitrogen timing, no-tillage, and soil health.  \nb) Worked with project farmers to build knowledge and evaluate implementation of \npractices similar to CSCAP experiments;  \nc) Conducted second assessment of 159 project farmers on i) agronomic practices on two of \ntheir fields to compare 2015 to their baseline 2012 practices, and ii) survey of farm practices \nand responses to changing climate conditions. Data were analyzed and used for graduate \nstudent papers and dissertation; \nd) CSCAP extension educators pilot tested and demonstrated USDA U2U project decision \nsupport tools to assess individual farmer fields or watershed level at topic specific field days \nand training programs; \ne) Print and video products were began for agricultural stakeholders around soil and carbon, \nwater, climate, extended rotations, and tillage;  \nf) Met with Obj 4 social scientists and U2U team to identify lessons learned from extension \nprograming and outreach about climate science and agriculture. \n \nPast Year Accomplishments \u2013 OBJECTIVE 6 SPECIFIC \nThe Y5 accomplishments of Obj. 6 were focused on high school science and graduate \neducation in these key areas: (1) translation of the science on climate change and agriculture \n(from this project and others) into educational materials for targeted stakeholder groups, (2) \ncontinued development of the next generation of scientists and agricultural professionals to \u201cdo\u201d \nagricultural science, and (3) targeted dissemination of the science, research, processes, results, \nand implications to priority audiences of the project: graduate students, undergraduate students, \nand high school science and agriculture teachers. These accomplishments align with project \nmilestones (Appendix B). \nSpecifically: \n9 \n \na) Knowledge of team science theory (i.e. transdisciplinary) was facilitated so graduate \nstudents on the project increased capacities to become contributing scientists in their own \ndisciplines and effective members of interdisciplinary teams; \nb) 31 graduate students and post-doctoral associates developed posters and one-page research \nsummaries and planned a two-day program in October 2015 to meet with USDA personnel, \ngovernment leaders, elected officials and NGOs in Washington, DC to share their project \nresearch and learn about career opportunities in government post-graduation. \nc) Project graduate students were coached in preparing post-graduation resumes, \ncommunicating science via written and spoken means, and collaborating with internal and \nexternal partners to academia, and via a spring webinar series \u201cPractical Tools and \nInformation for Emerging Scientists\u201d highlighting 7 speakers;  \nd) Science and agricultural education teachers were engaged in learning opportunities to \nunderstand how land surfaces processes and cropping systems impact climate and are \nimpacted by climate change using local and regional agriculture examples. Conducted three \none-week Climate Education Camps for teachers at Lincoln University, South Dakota State \nUniversity, and The Ohio State University.  \ne) Knowledge about climate change science was promoted via NCSE CAMEL virtual site \nwhich targets secondary teachers; CSCAP materials were populated to CAMEL as a \nreference on agriculture and climate; and, \nf) Linkages and synergy with national and international organizations were utilized by \nfaculty and students to promote a scientific discourse on climate change. \n \nTeam Outcomes/Impacts for Y1-Y5 \nOverview of Outcomes To-Date \nCollaborative research clusters and subgroups have worked effectively together on a cross-\ndisciplinary and regional basis to analyze data and increase development of joint publications as \nresult of increased understanding of diverse disciplinary perspectives and stronger trust \nrelationships. The highlight of Y5 team outcomes was the analysis and synthesis of project data \nto summarize key findings and develop recommendations. This required a high level of \nengagement, much energy and many workgroup meetings, intense integration efforts, and in-\nperson discussion at the annual meeting with rewarding results: 119 workgroup-based \nrecommendations; 59 synthesized recommendations scaled to overall team goals of carbon, \nnitrogen, water, stakeholders, climate, and pests; and finally to 17 highly integrated concepts \nwhich are the foundation for new knowledge creation and strengthening of the body of science in \nmanaging corn-based cropping systems for productivity and ecological integrity with attention to \nsoil and water resources under increasingly variable climate conditions (Appendix H). The \nformation of writing groups around three or four of these integrated themes has strengthened \nmulti-disciplinary investments in coupled human-natural science.  \n \nMembers of the CSCAP have increased their comfort in communicating across disciplines and \nactively exchanging knowledge and generating new ideas to guide hypothesis testing and \ninterpretation of findings. The effectiveness of our project processes and structure was published \nin the journal of Ecology & Society (Morton et al. 2015) with CSCAP project director, and co-\nauthors, the Pine and Wheat CAP project directors articulating the architecture of big projects \nand the integration processes and mechanisms of many disciplines working together to \naccomplish transdisciplinary science. These three USDA-NIFA CAP directors have been invited \n10 \n \nby the National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center (SESYNC) to convene a national \nworkshop on big interdisciplinary science teams and to co-author a manual for large scale \ncollaboration. \n \nAs the project nears the end of Y5, there are a number of high profile outcomes and impacts \nmaking the work of the project visible. The print and media products from the Resilient \nAgriculture National Conference held August 5-7, 2014 in Ames, Iowa continue to be \nrepurposed in magazine articles, presentations, and other media. The 48-page color magazine \npublished for the national conference with the farmer audience in mind highlights project \nfindings and was awarded an Extension Education Materials Award of Excellence from the \nAmerican Society of Agronomy. A project-wide effort was the publication of key research in the \nJournal of Soil and Water Conservation (JSWC) November-December 2014 issue on Climate \nand Agriculture at http://www.jswconline.org/. Two years in the making, 14 of the 20 articles \nwere authored all or in part by CSCAP researchers and graduate students. These articles have \nnetted in more than 26,000 total accesses by users to-date including abstract views, PDF \ndownloads. Since publication, several of the papers have reached 2500 accesses individually \nwith a range of 830 to 4900 accesses per paper; these are impressive numbers for all. The \npublication of the team research in the 2014 JSWC special issue and other journals demonstrate \nthe increased capacity of the team to synthesize and model our data and publish project findings \n(see Appendix C for total outputs per year and Appendix D for detailed past year outputs). As a \nresult of the success of the 2014 Special Issue, the Soil and Water Conservation Society has \ninvited CSCAP to develop a second Special Issue on Sustainability of Corn, based on our project \nrecommendations, for submission in 2016 and publication in 2017. The team\u2019s publication \nguidelines for how research data and findings are published (including recognizing USDA \nfunding sources) have been used extensively in the preparation, submission, and publication of \nproject findings and shared widely with other projects who are just beginning multi-disciplinary \nwork. \n \nOne outcome from the training of undergraduate and graduate students has been the publication \nof 66 journal articles they have authored/co-authored to-date. This is an important metric of \nsuccess as these students graduate and move into science-based careers. Students continue to \nlearn how to be scientists from their major professors and other project scientists. The systems \nscience focus and cross-disciplinary opportunities to learn has attracted talented young people \ninto the team, and to agricultural-based sciences overall.  \n \nField 8. B-2. Team Outcomes/Impacts for Y1-5 \u2013 WORKGROUP AND OBJECTIVE \nSPECIFIC \nThe cumulative efforts of team members for the life of the project has resulted in highly \nintegrated and purposeful outcomes that are continuing to become evident and will be fully \ndeveloped in the remaining time. Throughout Y1-Y5, team members have purposefully learned \none another\u2019s sciences, disciplinary language, areas of connection, and became trusted \ncolleagues. Workgroups during Y5 compiled an extensive list of major findings and \nrecommendations based on the science of the team and are the major outcomes of the \nCSCAP. Please see Appendix H for specific recommendations by workgroup and Objectives \nwhich often included personnel from multiple Objectives. Recommendations are going through \nreview and discussion again by team members in an effort to finalize and move out to external \n11 \n \naudiences. In addition to the disciplinary, multi-disciplinary, and transdisciplinary science \nrecommendations produced by the team, project management developed recommendations for \nresearch database management and project management and capacity building (Appendix H). \n \nWorkgroup recommendations have been synthesized and scaled up to higher levels to frame five \n\u201cbig idea\u201d papers for publication in Y6. These high-impact papers propose conceptual themes \nderived from the workgroup presentations, group data synthesis, and post-meeting survey results. \nThey are:  \n\u2022 PAPER 1. Climate and weather-sensitive conservation approaches which account for site \nvariations. \n\u2022 PAPER 2. Environmental and ecosystem services attained through improved farming \npractices.  \n\u2022 PAPER 3. Biophysical and social indicators as monitoring and feedback mechanisms to \nassess benefits and shortcomings of management practices that reduce uncertainty and risk \nunder variable climate conditions. \n\u2022 PAPER 4. Iterative exchanges and learning among stakeholders and scientists that influence \ntransfer of science and decision-making. \n\u2022 PAPER 5. Development of public policy that reflects interannual volatility from weather \nvariability and longitudinal system stability through implementation of climate-appropriate \nconservation strategies.  \n \nA sixth proposed big idea paper under exploration connects the work of the CSCAP and U2U \nproject by linking some of our corn-based management recommendations to U2U climate \ndecision support tools.  \n \nField 8. C-1. Team Outputs for Y1-5 \nThe team uses a mix of virtual (whole team and subgroups), small in-person meetings, and \nannual whole team meetings to accomplish project goals and deliverables. To date, the team has \nhad 355 virtual meetings and annual (internal) team meetings in Years 1, 2, 3, and 5. In Y4, our \nteam hosted a three-day national conference in Ames, IA which communicated the team science \nto key stakeholders while also acting as a feedback mechanism and facilitating the integration of \nstakeholder viewpoints into the science and outputs of the team in Y5.  \n \nEfforts to communicate team science and findings throughout the project life include:  \n\u2022 External team website (www.sustainablecorn.org) with many materials being transferred \ncurrently to LGU extension online stores for legacy. \n\u2022 Postings on the CSCAP & U2U AgriClimate Connection blog made biweekly. \n\u2022 A 48-page magazine containing 21 articles by our team members. A total of 520 print \ncopies have been distributed to date to farmers and crop advisors. The magazine \ncontinues to be available electronically on our public website.  \n\u2022 The 2014 national conference for Corn Belt farmers, crop advisors and CSCAP team \nmembers was promoted via news releases to ~400 local and national farm press, farm \norganizations, etc. \n\u2022 Nov-Dec 2014 Journal of Soil and Water Conservation, special issue on Climate Change \nand Agriculture included project research findings, database management, and student \nperspectives as transdisciplinary team members. \n12 \n \n \nField 8. C-2. Team Outputs for Y1-5 - OBJECTIVE 1 & 2 SPECIFIC \nThe Obj. 1 & 2 teams have subgroups and several of these groups meet once per month during \nnon-field season to discuss processing and synthesis of data and writing of papers. Many \nmembers are on multiple teams so they attend numerous virtual meetings per month. The \nworking groups include drainage water management, cover crops, organic cropping systems \n(possible through leveraged funding), greenhouse gas, tillage, nitrogen, and extended rotations; \nsome meet informally on an ad-hoc basis due to limited research sites and personnel involved.  \nTeam members are nearly finished collecting field research data with much of the data in the \nresearch database and PI\u2019s along with the data team are working hard to ensure team members \nkeep up in getting remaining data entered. The entry of management information (metadata) and \nresearch data is a substantial output for these Objectives and represents hours and hours of hard \nwork by data collectors as well as the database team. Our aggressive approach in uploading data \nis a major output to-date and allows for more rapid dissemination and use by other team \nmembers. Standardized protocols, developed in Year 1 for the CSCAP researchers to use as \nstandard methods and published in the JSWC 2014 Special Issue has been the most accessed \npaper from the issue with over 4900 accesses to-date. This paper provides a mechanism for \nfurther integration into proposals, research and reference by CSCAP members, and use by non-\nCSCAP individuals.  \n \nIn Y5, Obj. 1 & 2 personnel were highly productive in communicating their science and \nproduced a total of 134 outputs and reached 7995 individuals in-person (Appendix D; see PIs: \nCastellano, Cruse, Dick, Fausey, Frankenberger, Gassmann, Helmers, Kladivko, Kravchenko, \nLal, Lauer, Mueller, Nafziger, Nkongolo, O\u2019Neal, Sawyer, Scharf, Strock, and Villamil). \nOutputs for Y5 are highlighted in Appendix C, Table 2. Combined with Y1, Y2, Y3, and Y4 \noutput data, the Objective has a total of 704 outputs to-date and 41,568 individuals reached in-\nperson.  \n \nSome recent papers to highlight from Y5 include: \n\u2022 Castellano M.J., K.M.

Team Outputs for Y1-5 - OBJECTIVE 3 SPECIFIC \nThe modeling and synthesis team meets monthly to present and discuss ongoing analysis results, \nenhance model integration and expand collaborative analysis efforts. Several Obj. 3 members \nalso participate regularly in the Obj. 1 & 2 working group meetings to build cross-\ncommunication and interpretation of field data to ensure syntheses are framed properly from an \nagricultural perspective. In addition, discussions occur regarding model results under future \n13 \n \nclimate change to determine if the findings align with current field-based results. This provides \ninsight to field-based personnel regarding the performance of management practices in other \nlocations and under future climate. \n \nIn Y5, Obj. 3 personnel were highly productive in communicating their science and produced a \ntotal of 32 outputs and reached 2878 individuals in-person (Appendix D; see PIs: Abendroth, \nAnex, Arritt, Basso, Bowling, Gassman, Herzmann, Kling, Miguez, and Owens). Outputs for Y5 \nare highlighted in Appendix C, Table 3. Combined with Y1, Y2, Y3, and Y4 output data, this \nresult in a total of 232 outputs to-date and 15,182 individuals reached in-person.  \n \nSome papers to highlight from Y5 include: \n\u2022 Necp\u00e1lov\u00e1, M., R.P.

Team Outputs for Y1-5 - OBJECTIVE 4 SPECIFIC \nThe social-economic research team met regularly to discuss ongoing data analysis and \nmanuscript and report writing. The publication of \u201cFarmer Perspectives on Agriculture and \nWeather Variability in the Corn Belt: A Statistical Atlas I\u201d was a landmark accomplishment and \nhas been followed this year by Statistical Atlas II, co-produced with U2U. The team finished \ntranscription of 159 farmer interviews conducted by project extension educators, constructed a \ncoding framework, and began data analysis.  \n \nIn Y5, Obj 4 personnel were highly productive in communicating their science and produced a \ntotal of 36 outputs and reached 974 individuals in-person (Appendix D; see PIs: Arbuckle, \nTyndall, and Wright Morton). Outputs for Y5 are highlighted in Appendix C, Table 4. Combined \nwith Y1, Y2, Y3, and Y4 output data, the Objective has a total of 243 outputs to-date and 5261 \nindividuals reached in-person.  \n \nSome recent papers to highlight from Y5 include: \n\u2022 Morton, L.W., J.

Team Outputs for Y1-5 - OBJECTIVE 5 SPECIFIC \nExtension educators have cultivated relationships with over 155 farmer leaders and group \nmembers during Y1-Y5 to collect farm management data which has helped to build \nunderstanding of system management and areas to hone in messaging. Several extension \neducators also have on-farm demonstrations they have sought out or received from grants; this \nhelps to transfer practices out onto the landscape.  \n \nThe extension team virtually met monthly to advance working group activities as well as a spring \njoint meeting with U2U. Overall, the extension team has presented in numerous local and \nregional settings with most presentations themed around cover crops, soil health, crop \nproductivity, and weather variability (see Appendix D for presentation titles and location).  \nIn Y5, Obj. 5 personnel produced a total of 52 outputs and reached 1996 individuals in-person \n(see Appendix D for Extension Educators, PIs: Ingels and Todey). Outputs for Y5 are \nhighlighted in Appendix C, Table 5. Combined with Y1, Y2, Y3, and Y4 output data, the \nObjective has a total of 385 outputs to-date and 15,520 individuals reached in-person.  \n \nField 8. C-6. Team Outputs for Y1-5 - OBJECTIVE 6 SPECIFIC \nUndergraduate interns (total n=48, Appendix E) at Iowa State University and The Ohio State \nUniversity were engaged in team research with their mentors and presented their findings in \ndifferent avenues including annual team meetings and the national conference. Undergraduate \nresearch assistants (total n= 85) across CSCAP institutions were also involved in research such \nas in-field data collection and conducting of lab procedures. Total undergraduate students \ninvolved in the CSCAP for Years 1-5 were 133 from 8 institutions.  \n \nThe education team has focused on the development of webinars for CSCAP graduate students \nand summer climate camps for teachers on climate and agriculture. Camps occurred at Iowa \nState University, Lincoln University, The Ohio State University, and South Dakota State \nUniversity (Appendix G). A partnership and subcontract were established with the National \nCouncil for Science and the Environment (NCSE) in Y4 to transfer CSCAP factsheets and \nvideos to the Climate Adaptation Mitigation E-Learning (CAMEL) website. In Y5, Obj. 6 \npersonnel produced a total of 19 outputs and reached 1253 individuals in-person (see Appendix \nD; PIs: Lekies, Miller, Moore, Nkongolo, Todey with affiliate Blockstein). Outputs for Y5 are \nhighlighted in Appendix C, Table 6. Combined with Y1, Y2, Y3, and Y4 output data, the \nObjective has a total of 102 outputs to-date and 6097 individuals reached in-person.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n15 \n \nField 8. D. Team Milestones and Deliverables for Y1-5 \nThe team milestones for Year 1-5 are attached in Appendix B and sorted by Objective. At this \ntime, the team is on track to meet Year 5 milestones with the most challenging time-wise being \nthe upload of 2015 research data due to laboratory processing necessary of many field trial \nsamples. Team members have brought on additional temporary staff and students to meet this \ndeadline. The team deliverables (outputs) for Years 1-5 are also tabulated in Appendix C for the \nwhole team and broken out for each Objective. Team members are also writing publications in \nrequested Year 6; these are not shown in the Appendix due to space.  \n \nField 8. E. Broad Impacts for Y1-5 \nThe project has had broad scientific impacts with the development of standardized protocols for \nmeasuring C, N, and water in corn-based cropping systems. It has also built extensive \npartnerships with the 25x\u201925 Alliance, North American Climate Smart Agriculture, USDA U2U \nproject, USDA Climate Hubs, NOAA-NIDIS, and USDA National Agricultural Library; impacts \nthat ensure the project findings, publications and products are widely shared in scientific and \nnon-scientific communities. The project has also established professional networks that will have \nfuture impacts on the development of new proposals, increased collaboration across-region and \nstate, extension programming around climate, weather, and agriculture, and overall increased \nrobustness in larger scale research and dissemination of findings. The legacy of the networks our \n86 graduate students have developed is just beginning to be realized by the students themselves \nas they seek post-graduate careers, prepare manuscripts for publication, and explore applications \nof their science with extension and agricultural stakeholders. Team members have been \npurposeful in extending team findings and information out to farmers, crop consultants, \nextension personnel, scientific community, and other key stakeholders throughout the region and \nnationally. The team has presented the findings of the team to-date, to 89,824 individuals. \n \nThe team has leveraged substantial additional funding building on the CSCAP project science, \ninfrastructure, relationships, etc. The $20,000,000 in support given by our original USDA-NIFA \ngrant has now been more than doubled by additional grants and contracts awarded to project PIs. \nThese grants are complementary funds pursued by PIs to enhance CSCAP research and \nextension efforts. A total of $15,734,231 has been committed for Years 1 -5, with another \n$9,924,592 in post project years, for a total of $25,658,823 in leveraged funding (see below \nTable for details, in chronological order of receipt).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n16 \n \nLeveraged Funding Source  Project Years 1-5   Post Project  Total  \nInstitutional support (approximate)  2,185,000 \n \n2,185,000 \nUnited Soybean Board  1,185,494 348,447 1,533,941 \nSurvey Funding (NRCS/Purdue Ag/ISU CALS)  51,400 \n \n51,400 \nU2U (USDA-NIFA) 5,000,000 5,000,000 \nBiological Agriculture Partners  95,000 \n \n95,000 \nIowa Department of Agriculture and Land \nStewardship  659,068 239,992 899,060 \nUSDA-NRCS (MO)  51,762 \n \n51,762 \nIowa Soybean Association  300,000 \n \n300,000 \nSARE Grant (Extension)  65,934 \n \n65,934 \nUSDA Grant \"Precipitation Intensity Over \nCentral US\"  1,000,000 \n \n1,000,000 \nLeopold Center  39,571 \n \n39,571 \nNREC Grant (IL Cover Crops)  619,836 413,224 1,033,060 \nMN Corn Growers Assoc  162,206 \n \n162,206 \nUSDA Hatch Grant (WI)  57,687 \n \n57,687 \nGreat Plains Climate Hub  25,000 \n \n25,000 \nNOAA-SARP Grant  283,359 \n \n283,359 \nUSDA-Evans Allens Grant (Soil Management \nand Properties)  256,400 128,200 384,600 \nMI Corn Growers Assoc  77,735 \n \n77,735 \nUSDA-AFRI Nitrogen Efficiency (WI & MO)  157,981 315,962 473,943 \nNorthern Plains Climate Hub  3,000 \n \n3,000 \nUSDA-NIFA Water for Agriculture Program 999,402 3,997,607 4,997,009 \nNSF Coupled Natural Human Systems (MSU)  1,096,554 365,519 1,462,073 \nUSDA Economic Research Service  25,000 50,000 75,000 \nIndiana Soybean Alliance  20,330 \n \n20,330 \nNLAE Climate Hub  75,000 \n \n75,000 \nUSDA Foreign Agricultural Service (MSU)  133,000 \n \n133,000 \nUSDA-NIFA Developing & Promoting Water-, \nNutrient-, and Climate-Smart Technologies  992,100 3,968,400 4,960,500 \nUSDA-NRCS Enhancing Natural Resource \nManagement Capabilities  45,000 45,000 90,000 \nUSDA ERS Adopting Cover Crops  22,871 45,741 68,612 \nIowa Water Center  30,000 \n \n30,000 \nNorth Central Region Water Network  12,041 \n \n12,041 \nSARE Grant (Field Demo)  6,500 6,500 13,000 \n Total Leveraged Funds :  15,734,231 9,924,592 25,658,823 \n \nField 8. F. Training for Y1-5 \nThe CSCAP team has included a diverse set of expertise and specialties across the faculty, \npostdoctoral researchers, topic-based specialists/technical staff, graduate students, and \nundergraduate students. Appendix E includes a complete list of team personnel with individuals \nsorted by their supervising PI/lab group. The CSCAP team has been actively engaged throughout \nin helping to train and develop students within STEM disciplines. To-date, a total of 133 \nundergraduate students, 86 graduate students (29 % minority and 49% women), and 19 \npostdoctoral researchers (74 % minority and 10% women) have been members of this team; this \nequates to a total of 3701 months for this cohort of next generation scientists. Our team\u2019s current \nY5 contingent includes 40 graduate students and 6 post-doctoral scientists.  \n17 \n \n \nDuring Y1-Y5, four graduate students were elected by their cohorts to serve as graduate student \nrepresentatives and members of the Leadership Team. These student leaders work to connect \ngraduate students to the opportunities within the CSCAP graduate student body and facilitate \ntransdisciplinary engagement. Each student served a one-year appointment:  \n\u2022 Andrea Basche, PhD student, Iowa State University: 2012-2013 \n\u2022 Lindsay Pease, PhD student, The Ohio State University: 2013- 2014 \n\u2022 Gabrielle Roesch-McNally, PhD student, Iowa State University: 2014-2015 \n\u2022 Samuel Haruna, PhD student, Lincoln University: 2015-2016 \n \nGraduate students continue to do outstanding work and are active, contributing members of the \nteam as well as represent our team in professional meetings and USDA functions such as past \nProject Director meetings (2014: Andrea Basche, Iowa State University, and Lindsay Pease, The \nOhio State University) and invited to participate in PINEMAP annual meeting and participate in \nthe graduate student discussions (2014: Gabrielle Roesch-McNally, Iowa State University, and \nChris Eidson, The Ohio State University). At our 2015 team meeting, graduate student posters \nwere part of a competition with the top 3 awarded for excellence: 1st: Mike Dunbar (Iowa State \nUniversity), 2nd: Chris Eidson (The Ohio State University), and 3rd: Trevor Frank and Joe Rorick \n(Purdue University). Awarding of the top posters each year has been a highly successful means \nto recognizing our student scientists and acknowledging their excellence. Several of the students \nhave also received awards at their Universities as well as conferences. Graduate students have \nbeen involved in the successful publication of 66 journal articles which they have authored/co-\nauthored to-date including an article solely authored by them in the 2014 special issue of JSWC \n(See Appendix C and D)  \n \nField 8. G. Concluding Statement  \nIn conclusion, as the project nears completion of Year 5, this transdisciplinary team of 159 \nscientists, technical specialists and staff, extension educators, graduate students and post-doctoral \nresearchers has achieved high-impact accomplishments. Many of these accomplishments \noccurred in Y1-Y5 while others will only become evident post-project. The team has become \nwidely known for not only the development of new scientific methods and findings, but also for \nour project structure and management which has integrated cross-disciplinary sciences and \nstakeholder knowledge to generate new knowledge.  \n \nKey accomplishments include:  \n1) Established standardized sampling protocols foundational to effective integration of regional \nprimary field data for synthesis and predictive modeling;  \n2) Created a shared database to better detect changes in soil and water, and document the impact \nof future climate on crops allowing us to identify patterns of soil properties and greenhouse gas \nproduction associated with specific cropping practices;  \n3) Calibrated, validated, and applied biophysical and social science models to show the impact of \nmanagement practices and future climate on regional scales using CSCAP field trial and primary \ndata;  \n4) Built an extensive cross-disciplinary network that provides capacity to address future natural-\nhuman system research questions;  \n18 \n \n5) Trained next generation scientists in disciplinary and transdisciplinary science including \napplications to stakeholders;  \n6) Developed research and project management databases which are serving as models for other \nprojects and institutions and the USDA National Agricultural Library (NAL) repository;  \n7) Translated social science findings in ways that engage policy makers, extension and farmers \nin the research of the project to create knowledge exchanges and willingness to try new \npractices; and,  \n8) Built capacity of secondary science teachers to incorporate agriculture and climate in \nclassroom programming.  \n \nThe Integration column (Appendix A) in our logic model represents both team values and the \nkey outcomes from the activities and outputs of the project. The high proficiency and \nproductivity demonstrated by team scientists and graduate students in team deliverables \n(Appendix C and D) is a clear indicator of meeting and surpassing project milestones. The \nrecommendations developed by the team members this year on a workgroup basis as well as \nteam-wide syntheses across platforms and scales is a significant scientific advancement in our \nunderstanding of managing corn-based cropping systems and their adaptation capacity to climate \nchange. Leveraged dollars and personnel resources totaling over $25 million demonstrate the \ncapacity and desire of project PI to increase the depth and breadth of work to meet the scientific \nchallenges and societal demand placed on our agricultural systems now and in the future.  The \nteam has actively worked to strengthen and build collaborative partnership to ensure that climate \nand agriculture remain a priority and capacity is built across sectors as it relates to corn-based \ncropping systems.  \n",

The team seeks to connect multiple sciences and evaluate \napplications that increase corn-based cropping systems capacity to 1) retain more soil carbon \nresulting in improved soil quality and sustainability, 2) limit loss of nitrogen during seasonal peaks \nobserved within Midwestern systems that have naturally rich soils and applied fertilizer, 3) stabilize \nsoil and nutrients during periods of saturated and flooded conditions while improving water \navailability and efficiency for crop use during moisture stress conditions, 4) build system resilience \nby integrating productivity and environmental goals through field, farm, watershed and landscape \nlevel management in the face of changing climate, and 5) transfer knowledge and findings through \nscience-driven, experiential learning opportunities to equip farmers and teachers. Data from the \nfield research network will continue to be collected and submitted to the database, integrated into \nclimate and other secondary datasets, with analyses, modeling and publication. Analyses of social-\neconomic data from the farmer survey and interviews support work clusters to test integrated \nresearch questions and contribute to iterative information exchanges among scientists, extension \neducators, farmers, and science teachers regarding differing management practices and farmer \nwillingness and capacity to adopt. Twenty extension educators will continue to build climate and \ncropping systems knowledge, interact with team scientists, and work with 200 farmers.

Overview: Team POW for next year of funding (Y4)  \n \nThe Climate and Corn-based Cropping Systems Coordinated Agricultural Project (CSCAP) is \nentering Y4 with goals to deepen the synthesis and integration of sciences, extension, and \neducation using a transdisciplinary approach which was strengthened in Y3. The CSCAP team \nseeks to understand and connect multiple sciences and evaluate applications that increase corn-\nbased cropping systems capacity to 1) retain more soil carbon resulting in improved soil quality \nand sustainability, 2) limit the loss of nitrogen during seasonal peaks observed within \nMidwestern systems that have naturally rich soils and fertilizer applications, 3) stabilize soil and \nnutrients during periods of saturated and flooded conditions while improving water availability \nand efficiency for crop use during moisture stress conditions, 4) build system resilience by \nintegrating productivity and environmental goals through field, farm, watershed and landscape \nlevel management in the face of changing climate, and 5) transfer knowledge and findings \n2 \n \nthrough science-driven, experiential learning opportunities to equip and educate farmers and \nteachers. These five platforms (carbon, nitrogen, water, systems, and stakeholders) were \nlaunched as the framework for all research, extension, and education efforts in Y3 and will be \ncontinued in Y4.  \n \nThe six Objectives of the CSCAP are: \n1. Develop standardized methodologies and perform baseline monitoring of carbon, nitrogen \nand water footprints at agricultural test sites across the Midwest.  \n2. Evaluate how crop management practices impact carbon, nitrogen and water footprints at \ntest sites.  \n3. Apply models to research data and climate scenarios to identify impacts and outcomes that \ncould affect the sustainability and economic vitality of corn-based cropping systems.  \n4. Gain knowledge of farmer beliefs and concerns about climate change, attitudes toward \nadaptive and mitigative strategies and practices, and decision support needs to inform the \ndevelopment of tools and practices that support long-term sustainability of crop production.  \n5. Promote extension, outreach and stakeholder learning and participation across all aspects of \nthe program.  \n6. Train the next generation of scientists, develop science education curricula and promote \nlearning opportunities for high school teachers. \n \nIn Y3, the project strengthened our multi-disciplinary approach, began to develop highly \nproductive topic-based workgroups, with many individuals sharing responsibility and leadership \nfor accomplishing the work of the project. In Y4 of this project, we will continue to build out our \nnetwork to better synthesize and integrate preliminary findings and literatures to accomplish \nproject objectives and milestones.  \n \nUtilizing the standardized protocols developed in Y1& Y2, we now have two, and in some \ninstances, three years of field data from our network of 35 sites, that are ready for analysis in Y4.  \nAnalyses will center on the suite of crop management practices studied in our field trials (no-\ntillage, cover crops integrated into corn-soybean systems, extended crop rotations, drainage \nwater management, nitrogen sensing, organic system water use, and landscape position) and \nutilize a variety of modeling techniques that integrate the coupled natural and human systems \nwith which we are working. Two-hundred in-depth interviews with farmers were completed in \nY3. Analyses of social and economic data from the farmer survey and interviews will support Y4 \nmulti-disciplinary/multi-objective work clusters to test integrated research questions and \nhypotheses and contribute to iterative information exchanges among scientists, extension \neducators, farmers, and science teachers regarding the strengths and weaknesses of varying \nmanagement practices and farmer willingness and capacities to adopt them. Concurrently, in Y4, \nprimary data as well as secondary data sources (such as weather) will continue to be archived in \na central database and used in conjunction with baseline data from Y1 and Y2.  New external \nfunding from the United Soybean Board will expand our agronomic data base to include more \nmeasures of the soybean portion of the corn-soybean rotation and will be particularly valuable in \nfurther informing what is known about both phases of the rotation system.  \n \nWe first discuss overall synthesis and integration plans and then present Objective-specific Y4 \nplans of work (POW), Y3 outputs, and Y3 outcomes/ impacts. \n3 \n \n \nSynthesis and Integration: Applying our Transdisciplinary Science. Although the project plan \norganizes milestones around a set of project Objectives, our work is about understanding the \nbiogeochemical systems that underpin corn-soybean production with a suite of experimental \npractices at many scales (field, farm, watershed, landscape) and under different climate \nconditions. Our goal in Y4\u2014synthesis and integration of our sciences and the multi-directional \nlinking to extension and education\u2014 requires intentional spaces and opportunities for the many \ndisciplines in our team to connect their expertise and examine scientific questions through the \nlens of our shared research goals (see Appendix D) allowing us to identify the global and specific \nquestions of interest to the project associated with carbon, nitrogen, water, stakeholders, and \nsystems. \n \nTo accomplish the next critical steps the team will continue the successful processes from Y3 \nthat are beginning to bear fruit and push forward in Y4 within and across Objective teams to \nintensify efforts to invest in cross-disciplinary and cross-Objective dialogues and work.  \n \nY4 whole-team POW tasks are: \na) Increase effective communication within and across the team to continue to develop \nbetter understandings of each other\u2019s science and find improved ways to \noperationalize what we are learning. \nb) Increase effective communication to our external target audiences, farmers and \nscience teachers, about what we are learning.  \nc) Begin to answer research questions that reflect the complexity of corn-based cropping \nsystems under changing climate conditions through synthesis and integration of the \nteam\u2019s multi-disciplinary knowledge addressing C, N, water, GHG, pest pressures, \nfarmer perceptions and capacities to adapt and mitigate to changing climate \nconditions.  \nd) Increase the blocks of face-to-face time of team clusters around our five platforms (C, \nN, water, systems, and stakeholders) to propose theories, analyze data, test \nhypotheses, publish science findings, and develop and test applications.  \ne) Increase integration of project functions (research, extension, education) through \nexpanded involvement in existing and new team clusters in ways that increase \nfeedback loops and product development. \nf) Plan and hold a national conference in 2014 (\u201cResilient Agriculture: Adapting to \nClimate Change\u201d (http://sustainablecorn.org/2014conference.html), to share the \nfindings of the project to-date via an interactive forum with US farmer leaders and the \nCSCAP team. \ng) Publish preliminary scientific findings including working closely with Journal of Soil \nand Water Conservation (JSWC) editors to produce the 2014 special issue (Nov-Dec) \non Climate and Agriculture consisting of peer reviewed and invited papers \nhighlighting agricultural systems research. \n \nField 8. A-2.

A-3. Team POW for next year of funding (Y4) \u2013 OBJECTIVE 3 SPECIFIC  \n \nThe Y3 plan of work for Objective 3 includes substantial synthesis and modeling of CSCAP data \ngathered during Y1-Y3, as well as data from associated projects; continued collaborative work \namong subgroups; improved functionality and support of the central database, and integrating \nsocioeconomic and climate data into datasets for modeling and analysis.  \n \nThis POW will be accomplished specifically by:  \na) Continuing to meet on-line every month within Obj. 3 and to hold one face-to-face \nmeeting. Objective 3 subgroups are organized around model domains and scales, such as: \nlife cycle analysis, field-scale modeling of agronomic and soil variables, and economic \nand environmental analysis at the watershed and regional scale. \nb) Completing the database\u2019s export functionality to allow the systems analysis working \ngroups to easily use the field data and assisting team members with data compilation to \nspeed synthesis and publication efforts.  \nc) Parameterizing APSIM with Y1-3 cover crop data and build scenarios that evaluate long-\nterm implications on crop productivity and soil and water quality.  \n5 \n \nd) Connecting landscape water transport and quality modeling efforts with socioeconomic \ndata from the HUC6 hydrologic units (Obj 4 data). \ne) Continuing economic modeling to examine implications of conservation practices on cost \nand necessary economic incentives to meet nutrient reduction goals across the upper \nMississippi. \nf) Continuing to test SALUS model performance with field scale data to verify accurate \nprediction of grain yield under future climate for each treatment.  \ng) Continuing to develop life cycle assessment (LCA) models using site data to evaluate \nmanagement practices at all sites and to identify trade-offs across the range of life cycle \nimpact categories.  \nh) Continuing to integrate climate model projections into the team\u2019s modeling in order to \nevaluate the response of management practices to future climate projections, such as \nthose for mid-century (2050). \ni)  Meeting with modelers participating in the USDA-sponsored Usable to Useful (U2U) \nproject to explore opportunities for collaboration and research synergies. \nj) Providing extension educators (Obj 5) with knowledge and tools to identify and adapt \nlocal crop management practices that have the potential to reduce climate variability \nimpacts. \n \nField 8. A-4. Team POW for next year of funding (Y4) \u2013 OBJECTIVE 4 SPECIFIC  \n \nThe Y4 plan of work for Objective 4 centers on (1) analysis of the quantitative and qualitative \ndata that were collected in Years 1-3, and (2) dissemination of that information, especially \nthrough the CSCAP Objective 5 extension network. Analysis and reporting will lead to improved \nunderstanding of farmer perspectives on climate change and adaptive and mitigative action; \ndissemination of that information to inform the work of scientists, natural resource and \nagricultural professionals, and policy makers; strengthening the transdisciplinary linkages with \nother project Objectives; and, continuation of learning partnerships with extension educators and \nfarmers in nine Corn Belt states.  \n \nThis POW will be accomplished specifically by: \na) Creation of a database with transcripts from in-depth interviews with up to 200 farmers. \nb) Analysis of in-depth interviews. \nc) Analysis of data from the Y2 random sample survey of 4,778 Corn Belt farmers from 22 \nHUC6 watersheds spanning 11 states. \nd) Sharing and joint analysis and reporting of Objective 4 data and information with other \nproject Objectives. \ne) Development of innovative outreach strategies and materials through partnerships with \nextension educators and farmers. \nf) Distribution of research-based information to farmers, the general public, agency staff, \nand policy makers through publications, extension materials, presentations, and blogs.  \n \nField 8. A-5. Team POW for next year of funding (Y4) \u2013 OBJECTIVE 5 SPECIFIC  \n \nThe Y4 plan of work for Objective 5 includes further development of farmer groups to gather \nresearch data for Objective 4, one-on-one analysis of farmers\u2019 production systems to assist in \n6 \n \nestablishing practices that will adapt to and mitigate climate change, and facilitated discussions \non weather variability and agriculture.  \n \nThis POW will be accomplished specifically by:  \na) 200 farmers will build knowledge and consider implementation of practices or establish \non-farm trials that mimic CSCAP experiments. \nb) Farmer groups use performance-based environmental management and risk assessment \ntools including the Nutrient Tracking Tool to assess individual farmer fields and \nwatershed or local area aggregate data that can be compared to Objective 2 research. \nTools equip farmers with means to measure impacts on carbon, nitrogen, and soil and \nmake informed decisions on adapting to changing climate. \nc) 20 extension educators will increase climate knowledge through monthly webinars, a \nface-to-face meeting for team capacity building (in addition to the annual meeting), and \ndiscussions with individual farmers and in groups. \nd) Integrate research and outputs from Objectives 1-4 by specifying outreach plans for \nfarmers and the general public to communicate research results and recommendations as \na result of CSCAP research. \ne) Extension educators will participate in the planning of topic-specific field days and \nmeetings for extension educators, agency and industry stakeholders, and farmers in 2014 \nwith emphasis on cover crops, reduced tillage, nitrogen management, controlled drainage, \nand extended crop rotations. \nf) Deliverables for year 4 include extension publications created with graduate students, \nupdated climate and agriculture PowerPoint presentations for use in winter meetings, and \nsemi-monthly postings in the U2U-CSCAP blog (agriclimateconnection.org).  \ng) Integration across research, extension, and education efforts facilitated through Objective \nleadership meetings and communication with researchers. Means of communication \nexchanges vary as appropriate among the research and extension members.  \n \nField 8. A-6. Team POW for next year of funding (Y4) \u2013 OBJECTIVE 6 SPECIFIC  \n \nThe Y4 plan of work for Objective 6 is shaped around five key areas: (1) translate the science on \nclimate change and agriculture (from this project and others) into educational materials for \ntargeted stakeholder groups, (2) awaken and inspire the next generations of scientists and \nagricultural professionals to \u201cdo\u201d agricultural science, (3) synergize and catalyze impacts and \naccomplish more than the sum of outcomes from Objectives 1-5, (4) integrate and cycle \neducational outcomes generated by the respective Objectives back to transform the project, and \n(5) target the dissemination of the science, research, processes, results, and implications to \npriority audiences of the project: graduate students, undergraduate students, and high school \nscience and agriculture teachers. \n \nThis POW will be accomplished specifically by:  \na) Promote knowledge about climate change science. Facilitate climate literacy.   \nb) Facilitate knowledge of team science theory (i.e. transdisciplinary) so graduate students \non the project can become contributing scientists in their own disciplines and effective \nmembers of interdisciplinary teams. \n7 \n \nc) Increase knowledge by working across disciplines and solving problems in a systems \nanalysis approach within the CSCAP project.    \nd) Use knowledge and experiences of team science to communicate disciplinary and \ntransdisciplinary science in academic and non-academic audiences.   \ne) Promote linkages and synergy with national and international organizations that promote \na scientific discourse on climate change.  \nf)  Science and agricultural education teachers engage in learning opportunities to \nunderstand how land surfaces processes and cropping systems (agroecosystems) impact \nclimate and climate change using local and regional agriculture examples and \nexperiences.     \n \nField 8. A-7. Team POW for next year of funding (Y4) \u2013 SYNTHESIS AND \nINTEGRATION ACROSS ALL OBJECTIVES \n \nSeveral key activities in Y4 are planned that require synthesis and integration and utilize our \ntransdisciplinary approach and build on the continuing accomplishments of each Objective. \nPurposeful, explicit plans for cross cutting activities and outputs among Objectives in Y4 are: \n \na) The field research (Obj 2) and modeling/synthesis (Obj 3) teams have several efforts that \ninclude multi-disciplinary collaboration to address and appropriately explain findings and \nextrapolate using models. Preliminary analyses conducted to-date show unique regional \ndifferences due to soil type, environment, and management practices. In Y4, the teams \nwill work to better parameterize the expected mitigative and adaptive potential of these \npractices and the conditions impacting their relative performance. Cross-cutting efforts \ninclude (but not limited to):   \n\u2022 Water drainage flow differences based on calendar and precipitation patterns \nacross the region impacting runoff, water quality, and nitrate leaching. \n\u2022 Total biomass of cover crops based on heat unit accumulation and relative impact \non soil health and cash crop performance. \n\u2022 Nitrous oxide flux variability due to management practices, rainfall, and other \nfactors that impact net response. \n\u2022 Crop diversity and length of rotation impact on soil carbon sequestration. \n\u2022 Pest pressure response (short- and long-term) to management practices (funded \nthrough leverage United Soybean Board funds). \n\u2022 Water use efficiency of organic cropping systems that have differing plant \ncompositions, including variations in weed pressure. \nb) The social-economic research of Objective 4 has established a number of cross-objective \nsynthesis and integration efforts that include theory development, analyses and writing \npartnerships that will develop academic and lay publications in support of extension and \neducation and ground-truthing research findings with project farmers through listening \nsessions. Major efforts include:  \n\u2022 Linking the farmer survey data to biophysical team scientists\u2019 data and expertise \nin several areas: pest management (Obj. 2 IPM scientists), variations in \nprecipitation (climate scientists), and conservation practices (Obj2 scientists).  \n8 \n \n\u2022 Analysis and writing partnerships with the USDA U2U farmer decision support \ntools project which co-developed and co-funded the 2012 farmer survey will \ncontinue to co-publish in Y4.  \n\u2022 Application of the survey and interview findings to extension educators\u2019 work \nwith farmers individually and at winter meetings and field days via presentations, \nwebinars, print and electronic media.  \n\u2022 Employing farmer survey and in-depth interview data to inform Center for \nAgriculture and Rural Development\u2019s (CARD) (Objective 3), land use modeling \nactivities. Survey and interview data on farmer willingness and capacity to \nimplement innovative practices (e.g., nutrient management, use of cover crops) \nwill lead to development of more realistic scenario development and landscape-\nlevel modeling of the potential impacts of practice adoption.   \nc) The extension team, Objective 5, works closely with the social-economic Objective 4 \nteam in equipping extension educators to better understand farmer audiences so as to \nprovide educational interventions that support farmers in learning about and \nexperimenting with a variety of adaptive strategies in response to a changing climate. A \nNC SARE grant written and received by Objective 5 team will fund two Y4 face-to-face \nprofessional development meetings and will be jointly planned and conducted by \nObjective 4 and 5 teams with input from Objective 1-3 scientists. A mid-year face-to-face \nmeeting will include a facilitated discussion between farmer group members, extension \neducators, and researchers. Information gathered through this activity will help to refine \nproject\u2019s scientific, extension and educational programming. A second integrative effort \nwill be product-centered partnerships between extension educators, farmers and the \nCSCAP graduate students. Specifically, graduate students will work with extension \neducators and farmers to translate their research into practical and accessible \npublications. \nd) The education team, Objective 6, will collaborate with Objective 1 & 2 scientists to \ncreate hands-on exercises that are field or laboratory based for teacher workshops in the \nsummer. \ne) As a team, the sustainablecorn.org website is co-sponsoring a blog, \u201cAgriClimate \nConnection\u201d (http://www.sustainablecorn.org/blog/), with the USDA-NIFA funded U2U \nteam. This blog was an effort between the two project communication teams and \nextension, with ideas and writing support from team scholars of both projects. \n \nField 8. B-1. Team Outcomes/Impacts for Y3 \n \nOverview of Progress To-Date \nOverall, during Year 3, team members within Obj 1-4 made substantial progress as they began \nworking together to synthesize Y1 and Y2 data, both biophysical and socioeconomic.  This effort \nrequired an increase in meeting frequency, content discussions, and peer-to-peer responsibilities \nand expectations. The team has made good progress toward Y3 milestones, with leadership \ndetermined in keeping members focused and on track.  \n \nThe CSCAP team has increased capacity to synthesize and integrate across disciplines and \ncontinue the momentum building from Years 1 & 2 in which a strong foundation was laid by \nplacing high value on understanding one another and working hard to be knowledgeable \n9 \n \nregarding other disciplines. This has taken and continues to take significant time but the \nrewards are starting to become evident through high quality and quantity outputs (see \nAppendix B), training of undergraduate and graduate students, and colleagues who enjoy \nworking with one another and collaborating on innovative research questions.  \n \nThe team continues to function largely as a virtual community with limited in-person meetings; \nthis necessitates that members self-organize and are individually driven to succeed and meet or \nexceed expectations. The team\u2019s publication guidelines (see Appendix E) for how research data \nand findings are published are being used with members recognizing USDA funding sources \nwhen possible given format restrictions and availability of space.  \n \nTwo team evaluations were conducted in Y3 of leadership and advisory members using \ninterview methodology in Feb 2013 (evaluation 1; see Appendix F) and of the entire team during \nmid-term (July 2013) using a web-based survey tool (evaluation 2). The first evaluation provided \noutside perspective on team progress and dynamics with six recommendations that were \nconsidered and implemented by the leadership team. Two of the six recommendations were \nregarding the IPM and education (Obj 6) teams and the need to increase focus and integration; \nboth teams held strategic meetings with the IPM team developing a proposal and receiving \nfunding by the United Soybean Board and the education team developing a new work plan (see \nObj 6 milestones in Appendix 1). The second evaluation was a mid-course assessment (using the \nsame tool as the pre- and post-assessment) and clearly identified the CSCAP team as a team that \nis increasingly becoming more transdisciplinary with a high interest and desire to work well \ntogether and meet stated goals.  \n \nMembers of the CSCAP are now relatively comfortable communicating across disciplines and \nhave new ideas and connections to their discipline because of it. This is reflected in the \ncomprehensive research directive (initiated inY2) which provides the foundational disciplinary \nand multidisciplinary research questions and hypotheses upon which the team has added to in the \npast year.   \n \nUndergraduate and graduate students are learning from their major professors how to be \nscientists. Many CSCAP graduate students graduated in Year 3 and new students began. The \ntype of science conducted and approach taken by this team continues to attract some of the \nbrightest young people into the team, and to agricultural-based sciences. \n \nField 8. B-2. Team Outcomes/Impacts \u2013 OBJECTIVE 1 & 2 SPECIFIC  \n \nY3 outcomes include:  \na) Continuation of a research network with 35 sites that is being leveraged for additional \nfunds and research beyond the original scope of CSCAP and is used to drive scientific \nand lay publications,  \nb) Further discussion of nuances related to protocol carryout with gaps or errors addressed \nat a minimal number of sites. This occurred prior to the Y3 field season beginning and \nthus, ensured Y3 detailed measurements were nearly error-free in terms of methodology,  \nc) Continued development of graduate student capacity in conducting field research and a \nknowledge of protocol methods beyond their specific discipline,  \n10 \n \nd) Familiarity with new techniques, such as photoacoustic spectroscopy, that enable real-\ntime data collection versus traditional methods,  \ne) Greater appreciation for the modeling and synthesis ability of Obj 3 personnel based on \nworking group discussions and products,  \nf) Sharing of preliminary findings (Y1 and Y2) to the entire team to aid comprehension and \nknowledge of C, N, and water responses to the treatments being investigated to allow \nwork amongst Obj 3-6 to continue forward, avoiding an information bottleneck, and  \ng) Dissemination of research through articles in international journals, presentations, and the \nmedia to build scientific knowledge of the capacity these treatments having for adaptation \nand mitigation.  \n \nField 8. B-3. Team Outcomes/Impacts \u2013 OBJECTIVE 3 SPECIFIC  \n \nY3 outcomes include:  \na) Interactions with the central database and data owners to ensure proper understanding and \nuse of the primary data and assessment of data quality, \nb) Calibrations of biophysical models based on interactions with both internal and external \npartners and model testing performed using Y1-Y2 data,  \nc) Supporting Obj 1 & 2 members in data entry and in completing necessary edits to ensure \na high quality database exists for team use, \nd) Continued development of graduate student capacity in data synthesis and modeling with \nconnections to field research that go beyond their specific discipline,  \ne) Sharing of preliminary modeling and synthesis of Y1 and Y2 data to the entire team to \naid comprehension and knowledge of system and landscape responses to treatments being \ninvestigated, \nf)  Producing assessments of accuracy and realism of climate simulations and climate-\nchange projections relevant to the project, \ng) Dissemination of research through articles in international journals, presentations, and the \nmedia to build scientific knowledge of the effectiveness of these treatments in providing \nclimate adaptation and mitigation, and, \nh) Continuing to build partnerships beyond the CSCAP to connect with data sources and \nmodel developers. In Y3, partnerships with Dr. Cesar Izaurralde and Dr. Jimmy \nWilliams have enabled extensive testing with the EPIC model. Collaborations, and \nresulting publications (see Appendix 2), have also occurred with Dr. Michael Fienan \n(parameter estimation expert from the USGS), Dr. Tim Parkin (nitrous oxide expert \nfrom the ARS), members of the soil carbon modeling community (Dr. Steve Del \nGrosso & Dr. Keith Paustian), and Dr. Carlos Tornquist (EPIC and DAYCENT).  \n \n \nField 8. B-4. Team Outcomes/Impacts \u2013 OBJECTIVE 4 SPECIFIC  \n \nY3 outcomes include:  \na) Establishment of a strong research and outreach partnership with the USDA Purdue \nUniversity-led grant, \u201cUseful to Usable\u201d (U2U) and the National Agricultural Statistics \nService (NASS), which has led to jointly-authored research publications,  \n11 \n \nb) Continued development of transdisciplinary research and extension partnerships across \nthe CSCAP objectives,  \nc) Improved extension educator capacity to engage farmers about adaptive and mitigative \nmanagement options through intensive interaction with farmers and researchers on these \nissues, and  \nd) Dissemination of survey results through articles in journals, presentations, and media \nreports leading to improved knowledge of farmer beliefs about climate change, risk \nperceptions, and support for adaptive and mitigative actions among key stakeholders and \nthe general public.  \n \nField 8. B-5. Team Outcomes/Impacts for Y3 - OBJECTIVE 5 SPECIFIC \n \nY3 outcomes include:  \na) Extension educators in 7 of the 8 CSCAP states (South Dakota, Missouri, Wisconsin, \nIndiana, Michigan, Minnesota and Iowa) incorporated climate and agriculture \npresentations, information, and discussions into their existing extension programming \nefforts (see Appendix B) and reached over 500 farmers, crop consultants, and other \nextension educators, \nb) Cover crop implementation has been gaining momentum among state and federal \nagencies in many project states. Several extension educators have been able to lend \nexpertise in these programs and encourage use of cover crops as a practice that will allow \nfarmers to be better prepared for changing weather conditions, \nc) Throughout the start-up phase of the project, there has been considerable extension \neducator skepticism of climate science and climate change\u2019s effects to agriculture. The \nobjective leadership has encouraged questions and knows scientists and educators are \nlearning together with a goal of encouraging open-minded dialogues regarding what is \nknown, what is not known, certainty and uncertainty, and perceptions of risk. Leadership \nhas built trust and support among extension educators by sharing project resources as \nwell as concerns about and strategies for the transfer of climate science and agricultural \npractices to farmers, \nd) Garnering widespread support in the team\u2019s efforts to programmatically strengthen the \nLand Grant University\u2019s focus on climate education within agriculture represents a \nsignificant shift relative to past efforts. This programming emphasis is expected to grow \nin the future with the CSCAP uniquely able to lead and serve as an example. As the \nextension team has worked to develop climate training materials and messages that \nappeal to farmer and stakeholder audiences, the impact of climate on the water cycle has \nresonated well with extension educators as that impact relates directly to production \nthrough change in rainfall, soil moisture, relative humidity, etc. The team focuses their \nmessaging on the potential risks associated with weather fluctuation and crop production \nrisk management strategies rather than \u201cbig picture\u201d climate issues. Identification of these \ntopic-based outreach plans by the team is definite progress in communicating information \noutward in a way that can be positively received and implemented, and \ne) Partnership with the U2U project continued with the presentation of the beta versions of \ntwo decision support tools in which the educators participated in a guided review of the \ntools and provided feedback to the U2U project team. This direct link with U2U helps \n12 \n \nensure farmer decision tools are properly vetted as well as incorporated into Extension \nplans of work associated with row crops and climate science. \n \nField 8. B-6. Team Outcomes/Impacts \u2013 OBJECTIVE 6 SPECIFIC  \n \nY3 outcomes include:  \na) Graduate student involvement in research, extension and education efforts of the team are \nhelping to shape them into the next generation of climate and agricultural scientists and \neducators. A significant turn-over of students occurred in Y3 due to graduation and \nturnover will continue now at a heightened level until the end of the project (see \nAppendix C for graduate student listing); PIs continue to recruit and train up new \nstudents as they join. The graduate student cohort has contributed significantly to \nbuilding their own identity and connectivity, often being a resource for one another.  \nb) High student participation within the annual meeting poster symposium as well as \nprofessional society meetings, where attendees engage and ask questions of their work \n(see Presentations in Appendix B). \nc) The web-based graduate seminar titled \u201cProfessional Development for Emerging \nScientists in Agriculture and Climate\u201d highlighted six advisory board members or \nprofessionals as an opportunity for the graduate students to learn from experienced \nscientists and leaders who described their work within the agriculture and climate sectors, \nthe type of skillsets needed, and current gaps and emerging needs. Participants expressed \npositive attitudes about the webinar series and noted they were helpful in increasing \nunderstanding of different fields of study, transdisciplinary work, and practical \napplication of research, skills, knowledge gaps, and opportunities.   \nd) The appointment of our second graduate student representative to the Leadership Team \ncontinues two-way communication between the graduate students and the leadership \nteam to ensure an environment conducive to student learning and growth. \n \nField 8. C-1. Team Outputs for Y3  \n \nThe annual team meeting occurred in Y3 along with two strategic planning meetings for the \nIntegrated Pest Management team and Education Team in response to the Y3 evaluation report \nand recommendations (see Appendix F). The team met at Purdue University during the last \nweek of July for an intensive two-day annual meeting with 110 participants including advisory \nboard and special guests. Significant time was allotted to presentations of preliminary findings \nfrom Obj 1-5, table discussions about connections between the team\u2019s five platforms (carbon, \nnitrogen, water, systems, and stakeholders), Objective work time, and field excursions. The \nteam has grown substantially and the various activities and presentations sparked a lot of \nexcitement and discussion with ideas of how to further integrate areas within our team.   \n \nThe external website, www.sustainablecorn.org, was redesigned and populated with resources to \nenhance its usefulness to our primary audience of Corn Belt farmers. A blog was also launched, \nin partnership with U2U (www.agriclimateconnection.org) with team scientists and extension \nspecialists authoring content. The redesigned website and new blog were promoted and picked \nup by University and industry press. The team website has seen an increase in traffic; site usage \nstatistics from Oct. 2012 to Sept. 2013 show 3,915 unique visitors, 25,057 page views, and a \n13 \n \ntotal of 8,723 visits to the site. Additional external communication efforts in Y3 include \ndisplaying large metal signage at CSCAP research sites and smaller signs (with QR codes) for \nparticipating farmers, and training the team in creating videos for use on the website.   \n \nTeam members often provide expert opinion and recommendations to government agencies as \nwell as external partners; to-date, we know of at least 15 external relationships with our team and \nexpect the number to be higher in reality. For example, this year members responded to a need \nby NOAA and USDA that resulted in soil moisture monitoring being included in a memorandum \nof understanding.  \n \nField 8. C-2. Team Outputs - OBJECTIVE 1 & 2 SPECIFIC \n \nThe Objective 1 & 2 teams have several subgroups (as noted earlier) and these groups meet once \nper month during non-field season to discuss processing and synthesis of data. Many members \nare on multiple teams so they are on numerous virtual meetings per month. In Y3, Obj 1 & 2 \npersonnel were highly productive in communicating their science and produced a total of 140 \noutputs while reaching 8946 individuals (Appendix B; see PIs: Castellano, Cruse, Dick, Fausey, \nFrankenberger, Gassmann, Helmers, Kladivko, Kravchenko, Lal, Lauer, Mueller, Nafziger, \nNkongolo, O\u2019Neal, Pagliari, Sawyer, Scharf, Strock, and Villamil). Combined with Y1 & 2 \noutput data, Obj. 1 & 2 has generated a total of 302 outputs to-date. \n \nSome papers to highlight from this past year include:  \nMitchell DC, Castellano MJ, Sawyer JE, Pantoja JL. 2013. Cover Crop Effects on Nitrous Oxide \nEmissions: Role of Mineralizable Carbon. Soil Sci. Soc. Am. J. doi: 10.2136/sssaj2013.02.0074 \n \nKumar, S., A. Kadono, R. Lal, W. Dick. 2012. Long-term no-till impacts on organic carbon and \nproperties of two contrasting soils and corn yields in Ohio. Soil Sci. Soc. Am. J. doi: \n10.2136/sssaj2012.0055 \n \nStandardized protocols, developed in Year 1 for the CSCAP researchers to use as standard \nmethods, has been submitted for publication to increase use by external partners and build \ndatasets with similar parameters. These methods are used for measuring soil organic carbon \n(SOC), total nitrogen, soil physical properties, water quality and volume, greenhouse gas (nitrous \noxide [N2O], carbon dioxide [CO2], and methane [CH4]), crop biomass, C and N in biomass and \ngrain, insect and disease presence, and grain yield.  \n \nNearly all research sites were established in Y1, although additional plots were added and \nequipment added in Y2 at MN and OH for a total of 35 research sites currently. Research data \nfor Y1 are in the database and complete while Y2 data will be complete in fall 2013. Data from \nY3 will be entered in the spring/summer of 2014 as turn-around on samples needing to be \nprocessed takes considerable time. The entry of management information and research data is a \nsubstantial output for these Objectives and represents hours and hours of hard work by data \ncollectors as well as the database team.  \n \nThe IPM team received funding from the United Soybean Board in 2011-2012 and 2012-2013. \nIn conversations with the USB, it was discovered additional research interests revolved around \n14 \n \nsoybean footprints, similar to our work with corn footprints. The IPM team along with key \nCSCAP PIs from Obj 1 & 2 wrote a proposal and was funded $675,000 to address the \nproposed work at select sites and add to the CSCAP dataset.  \n \nField 8. C-3. Team Outputs - OBJECTIVE 3 SPECIFIC  \n \nThe modeling and synthesis team meet monthly to present and discuss ongoing analysis results, \nenhance model integration and expand collaborative analysis efforts. Several Objective 3 \nmembers also participate regularly in the Objective 1 & 2 working group meetings to ensure \ntheir results are framed properly from an agricultural perspective and appropriately account for \nvariation in soils, weather patterns, and farmer practices across the region.  \n \nIn Y3, Obj 3 personnel were highly productive in communicating their science and produced a \ntotal of 61 outputs while reaching 2406 individuals (Appendix B; see PIs: Abendroth, Anex, \nArritt, Basso, Bowling, Gassman, Herzmann, Kling, Miguez, and Owens). Combined with Y1 & \n2 output data, Obj 3 has generated a total of 121 outputs to-date. \n \nSome papers to highlight from this past year include:  \nRafique, R., M.N. Fienen, T.B. Parkin, R.P. Anex. 2013.

Gassman. 2013. Changes in hydrology and streamflow as predicted by a modeling \nexperiment forced with climate models. Hydrological Processes. doi: 10.1002/hyp.9836 \n \nObjective 3 involves the development of an analysis infrastructure that includes a database \nsystem to manage experimental data and a variety of biogeophysical and economic models \ncapable of analyzing impacts at multiple scales. During Y3, primary efforts of the database team \nhave provided support, management, and review of entered field data. A postdoc (Bunderson) \nwas hired and became the Data Manager; this addition was critical to supporting the research \nteam and completing database interfaces for data entry and export.   \n \nSeveral proposals were submitted by the Obj 3 team with funding received from the Leopold \nCenter ($23,400) for 2013-2014 supporting efforts to predict the long-term impacts of cover \ncrops using the APSIM model. Funding was also received from the USDA ($1,000,000) \nfocused on analyzing precipitation intensity over the central US (Arritt lead PI).   \n \nField 8. C-4. Team Outputs - OBJECTIVE 4 SPECIFIC \n \nThe social-economic research team met weekly or biweekly to discuss ongoing analysis of data \nand manuscript and report writing. Objective 4 PIs and graduate students also participate in \nObjective 5 conference calls and face-to-face meetings with extension educators. Outputs for Y3 \ninclude 4 peer-reviewed journal articles, 1 manuscript submitted for review, 1 poster presentation \nat a major international climate change conference, 22 HUC6 watershed-level survey data \ntabulation reports, 1 statistical atlas of survey results, and 5 presentations or webinars to \nstakeholder groups that reached approximately 1000 individuals (Appendix B; see PIs: Arbuckle, \n15 \n \nTyndall, and Wright Morton). The Objective 4 team has been rigorous in their meeting frequency \nand that is evident in their productivity and innovative findings. For Years 1-3, a total of 118 \noutputs have been produced by this team.  \n \nSome papers to highlight from this past year include:  \nArbuckle, J.G., L.S. Prokopy, T. Haigh, J. Hobbs, T. Knoot, C.

Team Outputs - OBJECTIVE 5 SPECIFIC \n \nExtension educators have over 155 key farmer leaders and group members for their state-based \nfarmer groups with the end goal of 200 across the region. As farmers are enrolled to participate \nin the project, they take a baseline assessment survey of their attitudes, beliefs and practices \nrelated to climate and conservation practices. A second assessment occurs early in Year 5 and \nwill be compared to the baseline to document change or lack of change in perceptions and \nbehaviors. Each farmer provides production and agronomic data for two fields within their \noperation that are evaluated using a suite of risk assessment and decision support tools; these \ndata are starting to be collected. CSCAP participating farmers, with support from their extension \neducator, consider a treatment(s) from those used by Obj. 1 & 2 (cover crops, tillage \nmanagement, and nitrogen management) to test on their own farm and assess risk and \nperformance.   \n \nThe extension team meets monthly via conference call and webinars to identify partners and \nresources that can create learning opportunities for their farmer groups. Team meetings are also \nused as professional development opportunities for the extension educators to learn more about \nclimate and other sciences the project is engaged in. A series of statewide and within-state \nregional publications (n= 81) were completed (Appendix B; see PI: Benning/Herzmann) for \nextension educators to use with farmers. These publications support the work of CSCAP and \nU2U and will interactions with a NOAA multi-agency effort on the National Climate \nAssessment.  \n \nObjective 5 met for a two day meeting at Monmouth, IL in May 2013 which was funded by a NC \nSARE grant. The purpose was to review the use of the Nutrient Tracking Tool and processes for \nusing performance measures as a platform for education and behavior change. The Obj. 4 team \npresented preliminary farmer interview results including emerging themes. Through discussion \nof farmer interviews and preliminary analyses, the extension educators began to connect the \nvalue of the interview process to better understanding of farmer needs and extension program \ndevelopment. The educators requested an internal website page to communicate meeting \nagendas, ideas, and attend meetings hosted by others.   \n \n16 \n \nThe research of Obj. 4 has been particularly useful in providing the extension educators a deeper \nunderstanding of the farmers they are working with. For example, the random sample survey \nacross the Corn Belt has also been administered to farmers that are in the working groups. \nFindings from these farmers were analyzed to help educators understand the variation in risk \nassessment and management practices among and between farmers. \n \nField 8. C-6. Team Outputs - OBJECTIVE 6 SPECIFIC \n \nA database was built of existing education curriculum on climate change and agriculture and also \nof existing teacher education workshops. This database identified a distinct shortage of climate \nand agriculture related curriculum for the Corn Belt region. This information helped to guide \ndiscussions at the face-to-face Obj 6 strategic planning meeting regarding where the biggest \nimpact and additions could occur in the project. \n \nA paper was presented (see PI: Miller), Bringing Disciplines Together:  Using the PERT Model \nto Reinforce Transdisciplinary Concepts during an Intensive Student Camp Experience, at the \nannual NACTA Conference. \n \nUndergraduate interns at Iowa State University were engaged in team research with their \nmentors and reported their findings through poster presentations.  A graduate coordinator was \nhired to promote the internship program (Science with Practice) among students and scientists. \n \nGraduate students participated in a breakout session and separate dinner at the Y3 annual \nmeeting and initiated a dialogue about the graduate roadmap and graduate seminar.  \n \nThe Y3 web-based graduate seminar \u201cProfessional Development for Emerging Scientists in \nAgriculture and Climate\u201d featured scientists and leaders who provided first-hand experience of \nworking within grand challenge areas related to natural resources and the necessary skillsets. \nStudents participated in weekly web-based discussions related to climate change and agriculture. \nA total of 46 individuals participated in the six webinars with a weekly average attendance of 24 \nencompassing graduate and undergraduate students, faculty, and staff; participants rated the \nwebinars highly.   \n \nLincoln University hosted the CSCAP summer climate camp for 13 high school students with \npersonnel from other Objectives providing content and support.   \n \nIn Y3, Obj 6 personnel produced a total of 20 outputs combined with Y1 & Y2 output data, this \nresults in a total of 45 outputs to-date (see Appendix B; PIs: Colletti, Lekies, Miller, Moore, \nNkongolo, Todey). \n \nField 8. D. Team Milestones and Deliverables  \n \nThe team milestones for Year 3 and Year 4 are attached in Appendix A and sorted by Objective. \nAt this time, we believe all Year 3 milestones will be met except for Objective 6 as some focus \nareas were revised (as stated earlier); therefore, summer internships, teacher training, and \ncurriculum development at OSU were not completed. The team, overall, is well positioned to \n17 \n \nmeet Year 3 and 4 milestones based on current progress. Year 1 and 2 milestones are not \nincluded here but can be found in the team\u2019s annual report submitted to USDA-NIFA in \nSeptember 2012.  \n \nThe team deliverables for Year 3 are attached in Appendix B and sorted by Objective; \ndeliverables for previous years can be found in 2012 report. The team has been productive again \nwith a total of 31 refereed journals, 118 conference presentations, 71 extension presentations, 27 \npress releases or news items, 24 white papers, 7 videos, 91 extension publications, 10 proposals, \n4 books or book chapter, 11 websites or blog post, 4 radio/tv spots, 15 partnerships with external \ngroups, and 5 project promotional pieces. Team members have also identified planned \npublications and various types of deliverables in Years 4 and 5; these are not shown in the \nAppendix due to space.  \n \nField 8. E. Broad Impacts  \n \nThe team has leveraged additional funding to address gaps or expand the work. To-date (Y1-Y3), \na total of $3,065,636 has been leveraged.  This consists of $1,675,000 in institutional support, \n$488,600 from the United Soybean Board, $375,866 from the Iowa Department of Agriculture \nand Land Stewardship, $334,000 in connection with the USDA grant \u201cPrecipitation Intensity \nOver Central US\u201d, $95,000 from the Biological Agricultural Partners to support organic-focused \nresearch, $51,400 for Survey Funding from NRCS/Purdue Ag/ISU CALS, $23,400 in connection \nwith the Leopold Center and $22,370 from a SARE grant. Additionally, team members have \nsubmitted proposals for leveraged funds that were not selected for funding but may be \nresubmitted in the future; to-date (Y1-Y3) a total of 19 proposals have been submitted by team \nmembers (see Appendix B).  \n   \nField 8. F. Training  \n \nThe CSCAP team includes a diverse set of expertise and specialties across the faculty, \npostdoctoral researchers, topic-based specialists/technical staff, graduate students, and \nundergraduate students. Included in Appendix C is the team personnel listing with individuals \nsorted by their primary Objective and then by supervising PI. To-date, a total of 61 \nundergraduate students, 51 graduate students, and 14 postdoctoral researchers are members of \nthis team. Many of these individuals have produced various items listed within the Deliverables \nsection as denoted by the author list.     \n \nThe CSCAP team is also actively engaged in helping train students within STEM disciplines. In \nY3, we initiated a STEM reporting form for all undergraduates, graduate students, and post-\ndoctoral researchers to complete so that we are tracking this in real-time. We hire talented \nindividuals who represent an array of backgrounds that contribute to the strength of the team. \nOur team\u2019s current contingent includes 36 graduate students and 12 post-doctoral scientists. Over \nthe past two and a half years, our team has included a total of 51 graduate students (25% \nminority and 39% women) and 14 post-doctoral scientists (65% minority and 15% women). \n \nLindsay Kilpatrick, elected graduate student representative for Y3 and member of the Leadership \nTeam, is working to connect graduate students to the opportunities within the CSCAP graduate \n18 \n \nstudent roadmap (described in detail in 2012 USDA report) and facilitate transdisciplinary \nengagement as possible. Graduate students continue to do outstanding work and are active, \ncontributing members. At our annual meeting, graduate student posters were part of a \ncompetition with top 3 places awarded for excellence: 1st. Andrea Basche (Iowa State University, \nObj 3), 2nd; Ao Li (University of Wisconsin, Obj 3), 3rd (tie); Maciek Kazula (University of \nWisconsin, Obj 2) and Jenette Ashtekar (Purdue University, Obj 3).   \n \nField 8. F. Concluding Statement  \n \nThe CSCAP team has been intentional about creating a productive environment that encourages \nsynthesis and integration of scientific knowledge across domain experts to improve our \nunderstanding of the interrelationships of the master variables of agriculture and climate, which \nare carbon, nitrogen, water, systems, and stakeholders. In Y4 this team of over 140 scientists, \ntechnical specialists and staff, extension educators, graduate students and post-doctoral \nresearchers will continue to progress toward addressing the societal challenge to mitigate and \nadapt the dominant Midwest corn\u2013based cropping system to climate change. As a result of mid-\nproject recommendations from our project evaluators, Y4 education goals and activities have \nbeen honed to invest more deeply in the next generation of scientists and provide science teacher \neducation materials that fit national curriculum standards and utilize what we are learning about \nclimate and cultivated agricultural systems. Central to the success of this will be creating \nstronger linkages between the team\u2019s education efforts to the research and extension. \nConsiderable investment by the United Soybean Board in Y4 will allow increased measurements \ndetailing the soybean portion of the corn-soy system. Our 2014 national conference, Resilient \nAgriculture: Adapting to Climate Change, (www.sustainablecorn.org/2014conference.html) co-\nhosted with the 25 x \u201925 Alliance will be one of the major highlights of the project, bringing \ntogether farmer leaders, project scientists, and our advisory board. \n \nThe project is beginning to publish preliminary findings (see Appendix B) with a number of \npapers under review for the Journal of Soil and Water Conservation 2014 special issue on \nAgriculture and Climate and other journals. Leveraged dollars and personnel resources totaling \nover $3 million to-date enable the project to increase the depth of work and build greater \nconnections among extension educators, scientists and farmers (see Broad Impacts on the \nprevious page for sources and sum of leveraged dollars). Synthesis and integration from our \ntransdisciplinary approach will accelerate in Y4 with project graduate students (the next \ngeneration of scientists) leading the way as they implement their \u201croadmap\u201d to becoming \ntransdisciplinary scientists. We believe the experience they are gaining through this project will \nimprove their practice of science, and will also prepare them for fulfilling careers addressing the \ncomplex societal challenges that will confront scientific fields in coming decades. \n \n \n \n \n",

This is because the air is \nprojected to warm, which can then hold more moisture. \nHeavy rainfall events have increased significantly more \nthan the annual or the seasonal totals have increased. \nThis trend is predicted to continue and to strengthen \nover the next 30 years.\nOver the past 60 years the Midwest has seen a slight \nwarming, mostly in the cooler half of the year, which  \nhas allowed the hardiness zones to move northward.\nWATER\nControlled drainage infrastructure can retain water  \nin the soil profile and be beneficial in years when \nmoisture stress occurs. Careful site selection and design \nare necessary to limit seepage from the system to \nimprove the likelihood of increasing growing-season  \nsoil moisture.\nLess benefit is achieved from controlled drainage \ninfrastructure in areas where a substantial portion of \ntotal annual drain flow occurs in spring resulting in the \nneed for drainage in order to complete field work.\nIn years with high daily temperatures and limited \nmoisture, no-till systems will have a yield advantage \nrelative to tilled systems.\nNITROGEN\nControlled drainage can reduce offsite nitrate loss to \nsurface water from drained cropland. The drainage \nsystems do not reduce the nitrate concentration in tile \ndrains; rather a reduction in nitrate loss is a result of \nreduced drain flow from the land.  \nCover crops are effective for reducing nitrate and \nsediment losses from a variety of cropland landscapes. \nModels of extensive adoption of cover crops across the \nCorn Belt region confirm that wider cover crop adoption \nby producers in the study region would be of value.\nExecutive Summary HIGHLIGHTS OF FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\nCorn is the major cereal crop of the United \nStates, with two-thirds of national corn and \nsoybean acreage concentrated in the Upper \nMidwest. Farmers in the region have highly \nspecialized knowledge and experience with \nthese crops and considerable capital and \ninfrastructure investments. It is critical, \ngiven an increasingly variable climate and \noccurrence of extreme weather events, to \ndevelop and test management approaches \nthat increase the adaptive capacity of corn-\nbased agriculture, and equip farmers and land \nmanagers to be functionally resilient. \nThe corn-soybean system has been the focus \nof research since 2011 by 140 scientists, \nextension and outreach educators, and \ncooperating farmers of the USDA-NIFA \nfunded Climate and Corn-based Cropping \nSystems Coordinated Agricultural Project \n(CAP), commonly known as the Sustainable \nCorn CAP. The project team and 35 \nexperimental research sites across nine states \nin the upper Midwest including Iowa, Illinois, \nIndiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, \nOhio, South Dakota, and Wisconsin and \ninvolve 10 land grant universities and USDA-\nAgricultural Research Service (ARS). \nThis technical report, Climate and Managing \nCorn-Soybean Agroecosystems (Volume 1) \nis a synthesis and integration of sciences \nspanning 19 disciplines and local knowledge \nof Upper Midwest farmers. The findings, \nimplications and recommendations in this \nreport represent research conducted by the \nteam over the last five years (2011-2016) and \nis focused on improving understanding of the \ncomplex interactions among weather-climate, \nwater cycles, nitrogen, soil carbon, and \nhuman-social systems of corn-based systems. \nThis work reflects experimentation and \nassessments of in-field management practices, \nsuch as drainage, tillage, cover crops, \nextended rotations, and nitrogen sensing \nto determine how farmers can better utilize \nthese practices to meet crop productivity \nand environmental goals under increasingly \nvariable weather. \niv w Climate & Managing Corn-Soybean Agroecosystems\nHIGHLIGHTS OF FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\nGREENHOUSE GAS \nTo reduce nitrous oxide (a greenhouse gas) emissions in a \ncorn-soybean system, replacement of corn with another crop, \nsuch as soybean or wheat, can achieve a greater reduction \nthan what can be achieved solely through improved crop \nmanagement practices.\nOur cover crop and drainage experiments showed no \nconsistent effect on nitrous oxide emissions from the soil \nsurface. More research is needed. \nCARBON\nLosses and gains in soil organic carbon, soil nitrate, and \nsoil water holding capacity are site specific. These changes \nreflect soil characteristics, position on the landscape, and \ntillage practices. For example, soil organic carbon in the root \nzone (0-20 cm) is eroded over time on slopes and summits, \ncausing crop yields to decrease in those locations. \nWhen used as part of a long-term (3+ years) soil \nconservation strategy, no-till can be implemented without \nyield penalty compared to more aggressive tillage systems \nin a corn-soybean rotation, under most Corn Belt \nenvironments. \nCover crops can be added to increase organic matter inputs \nand aid in protection of soil organic carbon.\nSTAKEHOLDERS\nFarmers\u2019 beliefs, attitudes, and concerns about climate \nchange, as well as confidence in their capacity to cope and \nwillingness to take adaptive and mitigative action, vary \na great deal across the Corn Belt. Strategies in support \nof adaptive management are likely to be most successful \nwhen they align with local context and conditions and take \ndifferences among farmer perspectives into account. \nFarmers are generally confident in their capacity to adapt to \nadverse weather. Highly confident farmers are less likely to \nhave experienced negative impacts of extreme weather. \nFarmers are pragmatic problem solvers. Our extension \neducators found farmers to be more receptive to exploring \nrisk management solutions when discussions focused on the \nchallenges associated with \u201cincreased weather variability and \nextremes\u201d versus the topic of \u201cclimate change.\u201d \nFarmers need more timely and accurate local weather and \nclimate information as well as tools to make management \ndecisions that effectively protect their economic, soil and \nwater resources.\n1\nClimate & Managing Corn-Soybean Agroecosystems s 2\nclimate and\nmanaging corn-soybean\nagroecosystems\nFindings, Implications and Recommendations\nsection 1. Introduction\n1.1 VARIABLE CLIMATE AND MANAGING \nCORN-SOYBEAN AGROECOSYSTEMS\nAgriculture in the United States (U.S.) is a complex and \ndynamic social-agroecological system. The temporal \nand spatial distribution of soil, water, climate, economic \nand social conditions affect the mix of crops farmers \nselect and the practices and technologies they apply \non their farms (Walthall et al. 2012). Corn-soybean \nagroecosystems, the dominant cropping system in the \nupper Midwest, influences and are regulated by these \nconditions with impacts on productivity and ecological \nwell-being at field, farm, watershed, and regional levels. \nThese systems have been the focus of research since \n2011 by scientists, extension and outreach educators, \nand cooperating farmers of the USDA-NIFA funded \nClimate and Corn-based Cropping Systems Coordinated \nAgricultural Project (CAP), commonly known as the \nSustainable Corn CAP. The project team and research \nsites span nine states in the upper Midwest including \nIowa, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, \nOhio, South Dakota, and Wisconsin. This technical \nreport is a synthesis of key biophysical and social \nfindings from the Sustainable Corn CAP research \nconducted over the last five years (2011-2016). \nManaging complex interconnected systems of carbon \n(C), water, nitrogen (N) and human action takes \nscience, experiential knowledge, and a capacity to adjust \ncrops and farming practices to integrate past and new \ninformation. A central goal of this project is to increase \nwhat is known about a suite of practices that can help \nfarmers create management systems that, in turn, sustain \na competitive agriculture and ensure the ecological \nintegrity of the landscape under increasingly variable \nclimate and extreme weather events. Climate change is \none of the primary challenges facing the production of \ncommodity crops and stewardship of land and water \nresources for future generations. Assessment of current \nsystems and adaptation experiments are first steps in \nformulating effective individual and policy responses to \nrisks, benefits, and pressures. \nCorn is the major cereal crop in the U.S., which along \nwith rice, soybean and wheat provides a total of 75 \npercent of the world caloric intake. Two-thirds of \nnational corn and soybean acreage is concentrated in \nthe U.S. upper Midwest. These agricultural commodities \nare economic engines for the region and the nation with \nthe production of corn, soybean, and wheat amounting \nto $357 billion during the 2011-2015 project period \n(see Appendix B). Farmers in the region have highly \nspecialized knowledge and experience with these crops \nand considerable capital and infrastructure investments. \nIt is critical, given an increasingly variable climate and \noccurrence of extreme weather events, to develop and \ntest management approaches that increase the adaptive \ncapacity of corn-based agriculture, and equip farmers \nand land managers to be functionally resilient. The \nSustainable Corn CAP institutions and scientists are \nwell suited geographically to identify the capacity and \nevaluate strategies that can improve the resilience of \ncorn-based systems. \nSuccessful adaptation strategies employed in this nine-\nstate region can be expected to be applicable outside \nthe area. The region has a diversity of soils, weather \nand climate, social, and economic conditions. There \nis a significant difference in range of crop acreage and \nproduction among the states are shown in 2011 to 2015 \nproduction values. Across these nine states, corn yields \nranged from 75 to 200 bu/acre (4707 to 12554 kg/ha), \nsoybean from 30 to 56 bu/acre (2017 to 3766 kg/ha), \nand wheat from 37 to 81 bu/acre (2488 to 5447 kg/ha) \n(Figures 1, 2, 3; Appendix B). The variation across this \nregion in production, soils, and climate has enabled the \nteam to evaluate a suite of management practices under \ndiffering scenarios.\n3Report Overview\nSection 1 begins by framing the U.S. and upper Midwest \ncorn, soybean, and wheat production systems to \nunderstand the current crops grown in the region. Next, \nproject goals regarding synthesis and integration of \nsciences and stakeholder views relative to production, \npest management, water, nitrogen (N), and carbon \n(C) are discussed. Section 1 ends with details of the \nproject research sites and biophysical and social science \nmethodologies used to conduct the research components \nof the project.\nSection 2 outlines team findings, implications and \nkey recommendations based on analyses, integration, \nand modeling of research data to address complex \ncomponents within these agroecosystems and a scaling-\nup to identify landscape-wide effects. The section begins \nwith a discussion of changing climate patterns in the \nupper Midwest, followed by productivity of corn-based \nsystems, and the water cycle, nitrogen and soil organic \ncarbon (SOC) stocks. Each subsection presents both \nbiophysical and social science findings, implications, and \nrecommendations based on integration of the sciences. \nSection 3 highlights the connecting threads among the \ndata, findings and recommendations, and suggests policy \nimplications and future research. \nSection 4, \u201cSupporting Scientific Publications,\u201d and \nSection 5, \u201cProject Principal Investigators,\u201d serve as \nreferences to Sections 1, 2, and 3.\n1.2 CORN-BASED SYSTEMS\nCorn, the most widely produced grain in the U.S., \nprovides the main energy ingredient for livestock feed, \nis processed into a wide range of food and industrial \nproducts, and approximately 20% is exported (USDA \nERS, 2014). Two-thirds of the U.S. corn crop is grown \nin a nine-state region of the upper Midwest, where the \nSustainable Corn CAP project took place. \nCurrently, and for the past several decades, the dominant \ncropping system in this region has been an annual \nrotation of corn and soybean. Other cropping systems \ninclude two years of corn followed by soybean, corn \ngrown continuously, and the addition of a third crop \nsuch as wheat. For the past five years, farmers have on \naverage planted 60 million acres (24 million hectares) \nof corn in this region, followed by 50 million acres \n(20 million hectares) of soybean and 7.5 million acres \n(3 million hectares) of wheat. These values represent \napproximately 67% of the corn and soybean U.S. acreage \nand 15% of wheat acreage. See Appendix B for acreage, \nproduction, and yield data per state and year (USDA \nNASS, 2016a; USDA NASS, 2016b).\nCorn-based systems are well suited to a wide variety of \ngeographies. Corn is particularly productive in the upper \nMidwest due to favorable climate and soils, although \nstresses can occur such as temperature, moisture excess \nor shortage, weed pressure, soil characteristics, fertility, \nand other factors. Yields for corn, soybean, and wheat \ncontinue to trend upward (see Figures 1, 2, 3) as a result \nof substantial efforts to improve crop genetic and farmer \nmanagement practices. Yet research has shown yield \ngains for this region would have been greater if climate \nconditions had been more stable (Mourtzinis et al., \n2015; Melillo et al., 2014; Romero-Lankao et al., 2014). \nUnintended environmental consequences of intensified \ncorn-based cropping systems present challenges that \nfarmers, crop advisors and policymakers must address. \nThe impact of variable climate on U.S. farmers is \npredicted to continue into the future based on model \nsimulations of two primary climate components \u2014 \ntemperature and precipitation. \nThese three major crops (corn, soybean, wheat) \ndiffer in plant physiology, progression of vegetative \nand reproductive development, and recommended \nmanagement practices. Because of these differences, \nthe impacts of climate change are crop and landscape \nposition specific. Corn-based cropping systems are \nvulnerable to these stresses from a changing climate:\n\u2022 Longer growing season (shifted frost dates)\n\u2022 Warmer winters\n\u2022 Warmer nights\n\u2022 More frequent severe precipitation events\n\u2022 Greater annual stream flows\nCorn, which is predominately grown in yearly rotation \nwith soybean, is a crop that is highly productive, \nintensively managed, and cultivated to positively respond \nto historical precipitation and regional temperature \npatterns. Corn and soybean production often represents \na low diversity of land use and, even without climate \nchange, has a history of unintended consequences on soil \nconditions, water quality, and water supplies (Morton \n2014). In the last 100 years, changes in the precipitation \npatterns in the upper Midwest have compromised \nproductivity in some locales, increased soil erosion, \naffected N leaching into water, increased nitrous \noxide (N2O) atmospheric levels, and altered timing of \nintraseasonal water availability.\n1.3 SYNTHESIS AND INTEGRATION OF \nSCIENCES\nThe Sustainable Corn CAP team has integrated \nknowledge from research spanning 19 disciplines, \n(continued on page 7)\nClimate & Managing Corn-Soybean Agroecosystems s 4\nFIGURE 1  |  CORN\nCorn acres planted and harvested, grain yield, and grain production value for years 2011 to 2015 in states within \nthe Sustainable Corn project region (USDA NASS 2016a, USDA NASS, 2016b).

The \nresult is a synthesis of research findings, implications \nand recommendations developed from analyses and \nmodeling based on field and survey data, climate data, \nand secondary data. This technical report (Volume \n1) and following volumes capture the comprehensive \nwork of the project, and connect multiple sciences \nand stakeholder perspectives to evaluate a suite of \nmanagement practices with these goals:\n\u2022 Increase soil carbon for improved soil quality  \nand sustainability \n\u2022 Limit loss of nitrogen from the system \n\u2022 Stabilize soil and nutrients during periods of \nsaturated and flooded conditions while improving \nwater availability and efficiency for crop use \nduring moisture stress conditions\n\u2022 Build system resilience by integrating productivity \nand environmental goals through field, farm, \nwatershed and landscape level management in the \nface of changing climate\n\u2022 Transfer knowledge and findings through science-\ndriven, experiential learning opportunities to \nequip and educate farmers and teachers \nIn the first two reports, Volume 1 and 2, Climate and \nManaging Corn-Soybean Agroecosystems: Findings, \nImplications, and Recommendations, site specific and \nsystem-scale project data are synthesized and integrated \nto address the challenge of climate change adaptation \nfor upper Midwest agricultural systems. The research \nencompassed includes not only the biophysical findings \npertaining to grain yield, C, N, and water cycles, but also \nthe social science findings on the views and practices of \nfarmers who are managing the landscape and seeking \nways to adapt to changing conditions while assuring \nproductivity and protecting the agroecosystem. \nVolume 3, Climate Change and Agricultural Extension, \nand Volume 4, Preparing the Next Generation Scientists \nand Teachers, use synthesis and integration to link the \nsuite of experimental practices at many scales (field, \nfarm, watershed, landscape) and under different climate \nconditions to extension and education. Volume 5, Project \nand Research Management of Data and Systems, presents \nrecommendations on creating and managing large \nmulti-institutional collaborative data, and the structural \nchallenges of monitoring and facilitating large multi-\ndisciplinary, multi-institutional collaborative science. \nVolumes 1 to 5 will be published in 2016 and 2017.\n1.4 BIOPHYSICAL AND SOCIAL-\nECONOMIC RESEARCH DATA \nCOLLECTED\nAn expansive field research network of 35 sites made \nup the biophysical research network and included \npreviously existing as well as newly established sites; sites \nwere in all project states except South Dakota (Figure \n4 and Appendix C). Across the sites, team members \nwere able to assess crop and environmental responses \nby researching a suite of management practices and \nmeasuring C, N, greenhouse gas (GHG), water quality \nand volume, pest populations, and agronomic \nindicators (Appendices D and E).\nMost research sites began collecting data \nin 2011 and measured parameters for five \nyears through the 2015 growing season. \nIn 2012, some additional treatments \nwere initiated, plots added, and \nmonitoring sensors installed. \nProject scientists collected and \nanalyzed biophysical data, using \nstandardized protocols developed by \nthe team prior to the first field season \n(Kladivko et al. 2014). Standardized \nprotocols exist for all data collected \nby the team, which includes soil organic \nFIGURE 4  |  Location of  \nSustainable Corn CAP participating \ninstitutions and field research sites. \nInstitutions\nField Research\n(may represent more\nthan one research site)\nBig\nBlue\nBig\nSioux\nDes\nMoines\nElkhorn\nIowa\nKaskaskia\nLoup\nLower\nIllinois\nLower\nPlatteMiddle Platte\nMinnesota\nMissouri\nLittle\nSioux\nMissouri\n Nishnabotna\nPatoka\nWhite\nRock\nSoutheastern\nLake\nMichigan\nUpper\nIllinois\nBlack Root\nMaquoketa\nPlum\nSkunk\nWapsipinicon\nWabash\nWestern\nLake Erie\nClimate & Managing Corn-Soybean Agroecosystems s 8\ncarbon (SOC), total N, soil physical properties, soil \nmoisture, water quality and volume, greenhouse gas, \ncrop biomass, C and N in biomass and grain, insect and \ndisease pressure, and grain yield (Appendix E). \nThe discussions and group decision-making were \ncentral to developing team standardized methodologies \n(Kladivko et al. 2014). The challenges of standardizing \nand ensuring methods are as similar as possible were \nworthwhile to achieve team goals related to temporal \nand spatial data analysis. But this endeavor required not \nonly effort upfront in establishing these, but continual \ncommunication, time-intensive management and quality \nreview by the data team, and high-level adherence \nchecks and correction by researcher leads and data team \n(Herzmann et al. 2014). Research data were uploaded to \nthe team\u2019s central database by team members with review \nand quality control performed by database managers to \nensure data integrity and adherence to standardization \n(Herzmann et al. 2014). \nThese field data were integrated with climate science \ndata to evaluate a suite of management practices. There \nwere many practices that could have been studied. The \nteam selected management practices that were widely \nused by farmers as well as counterparts to those that \nwere relatively novel or not yet widely implemented. \nDifferent management allowed a baseline of current \npractices to be established and determination of the \npotential improvement possible. Management practices \ninvestigated include: corn-soybean rotation, cover crops \n(cereal rye in particular) within a corn-soybean rotation, \nextended and diverse crop rotations, organic cropping \nsystem, drainage water management, canopy N sensing, \ntillage management (no-till and conventional), and \nlandscape position (Appendix D). \nEvery site included a corn-soybean rotation or \ncontinuous corn as a comparative baseline to measure \nchange over time from different practices and climate \nconditions. Specific sites varied in the combination \nof treatments studied, due to varying site capacities \nand when it was established. Integration and \nrecommendations were developed and are presented \nhere at a systems level, when possible. \nThe social and economic primary data were collected \nusing a mixed methods approach: a major random \nsample survey, conducted in partnership with the USDA-\nNIFA funded Useful to Usable project, of 4,778 farmers \nacross 11 Upper Midwest Corn Belt states (Figure 5) and \nin-depth interviews and pre-post surveys with a select \ngroup of farmer cooperators. The 2012 random sample \nsurvey, which was stratified by 22 HUC 6 (Hydrological \nFIGURE 5  |  Social economic research at \nthe HUC 6 watershed level map. \n9Unit Code) watersheds, drew its sample from the USDA \nNational Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) Census \nof Agriculture master list of farmers. Two criteria were \nused to select the sample from the overall population of \ncorn farmers: at least 80 acres (32.3 hectares) of corn and \nUSD$100,000 in the 2007 Census of Agriculture. These \nminimum production criteria were set because larger-\nscale operations farm a disproportionately large amount \nof acreage relative to their numbers: across the 11 states  \nin Figure 5, farm operations with 2007 gross sales of \nat least USD$100,000 gross farm revenue represented \n27% of farms with cropland, but cultivated 78% of all \ncropland acres (USDA-NASS 2009).\nThe farmer survey\u2019s main objective was to develop a \nresearch-based understanding of Corn Belt farmers\u2019 \nperspectives on climate change and potential adaptation \nand mitigation strategies. The survey collected data on \nbeliefs about climate change, concerns about predicted \nimpacts of climate change, recent experiences with \nextreme weather, use of decision support tools, current \nmanagement practices, and attitudes toward potential \nindividual-level and societal adaptation and mitigation \nactions. To date, this survey remains the largest \nscientifically rigorous survey focused on farmers and \nclimate change.\nThe second major social science research component \nconsisted of in-depth interviews with 159 cooperating \nfarmer-cooperators who were recruited from the Sustainable \nCorn CAP extension educators\u2019 networks. The interview \nprocess consisted of two parts: a longitudinal survey \n(baseline 2012 and follow-up 2015) and in-depth interviews \nin 2003 with the 159 cooperating farmers. The combination \nof in-depth interviews and surveys offered deeper insights \ninto how farmers are viewing the national and local climate \nchange conversation, their interpretation and responses \nto perceived risks, concerns for the sustainability of their \noperation and capacities to adapt (or not) to system changes. \nQuotes from in-depth interviews with these participating \nproject farmers, while not representative of all farmers in \nthe region, are used throughout this report to illustrate and \nelaborate survey findings.\nSECTION 2.

Although changing conditions \nare accepted as part of farming, the uncertainties \nassociated with increasing weather variability due to \nclimate change makes managing even more complex. \n2.1.1 U.S. Climate. The Third National Climate \nAssessment documents increased climate disruptions to \nagriculture in the U.S. over the past 40 years and projects \naccelerated impacts in the next 25 years (Melillo et al., \n2014). Loss and degradation of soil and water resources \ndue to increasing extremes in precipitation (Figure 6) are \nidentified as key concerns to both rain-fed and irrigated \nagriculture. The 2014 North America Regional Aspects \nReport by the Fifth Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange (IPCC) cites rising temperatures and carbon \ndioxide (CO2) concentrations, high vulnerability to \nclimate extremes, regional drought, pest infestations, land \nuse changes, and pollution as stressing North American \necosystems (Romero-Lankao et al., 2014). This report also \nfinds that effects of temperature and climate variability \non yields of major crops have been observed; and further \nnotes water resources are already stressed by non-climate \nchange anthropogenic factors. The authors conclude \nthe uncertainty and risks associated with increased \nrainfall intensities and highly variable climate influence \nagricultural productivity and present huge challenges to \nmanaging water and soil resources.\nIncreasing future climate variability is predicted to \nresult in heightened temperature effects and uneven \ndistribution of excess water and water deficits; these \nwill make crops vulnerable in known and unknown \nways (Morton 2014). As agriculture adapts to these \nspatial and temporal changes, land cover and use shifts \nalso will occur. Crop production may decline in some \nareas and expand in others. Changes in temperature \npatterns can alter accumulation of growing degree \nunits (GDU), growing season length, and precipitation \namount, intensity, and distribution (Johnson et al., \n2010). For example, soil temperature patterns (Figure \n7) influence where row crop production may expand \nto meet demands for corn and soybean. Recent \nexpansion of corn, wheat and forage production have \nbeen observed in the frigid temperature zone of North \nDakota and South Dakota with increases in temperature \nand precipitation (Laws et al. 2014). Without careful \nmanagement, a changing climate along the expected \ntrajectory will: 1) exacerbate soil erosion, transport \nand sediment deposition in streams, lakes and rivers, \n2) increase off-field and off-farm nutrient losses which \npollute water, and 3) threaten limited water supplies \n(Morton 2014).   \n2.1.2 Upper Midwest climate.

Image used with permission from the Journal of Soil and Water Conservation. \n11\nmask geographic variations in weather and climates \nacross continents and within regions in the U.S. The \nUpper Midwestern U.S. has experienced quite different \nannual and intraseasonal temperature and precipitation \npatterns compared to the rest of the country (Laws et \nal. 2014; Arritt 2016). In the past 60 years, the Upper \nMidwest has seen a slight warming most notably in the \ncooler half of the year, allowing the hardiness zones to \nextend northward. A 5 to 10% increase in average yearly \nprecipitation also has occurred, which for most states \nin the Upper Midwest equals 1 to 3 inches (2.5 to 7.5 \ncm). The greatest current and projected challenge to \nfarmers is the increase in heavy rainfall in the region. \nThere is evidence wetter spring and fall conditions in \nthe eastern part of the region present substantial field \nmanagement challenges and affect planting and harvest \nconditions. Heavy rainfall (>4 inch per day (>10 cm/\nday)) has increased significantly more than the annual or \nthe seasonal totals. These extremes in precipitation have \nbeen observed by many farmers across the region. \nA Wisconsin farmer compared past and current extreme \nrain events in his own local area: \n\u201c \u2026it seems our rains are less frequent, they\u2019re heavier, they\u2019re more intense than they were, than I ever remember \n\u2026not to say that we didn\u2019t have wet falls back then [the \nfirst few years I farmed]. I remember very wet falls. I \nremember very wet springs. I remember dry springs, dry \nfalls. But it just seems like, when we get rain now, it\u2019s a \ncouple inches at a time or it\u2019s just a trace.\u201d\nSustainable Corn CAP analyses of historical precipitation \nrecords reveal that from the 1950s through the present, \nthere have been strong increases in the occurrence of \nheavy rainfall across the region, despite only a modest \nincrease in total rainfall. Increases are greatest for the \nheaviest amounts (more than 4 inches per day (10 cm/\nday)). Specific findings include: \nFinding: Over the past 60 years the Upper Midwest \nhas seen a slight warming, mostly in the cooler half \nof the year, which has allowed the hardiness zones to \nmove northward.\nFinding: Mean precipitation is predicted to increase \nslightly, mostly in winter and spring. This is in part \nbecause the air is projected to warm, allowing it to \nhold more moisture. \nFinding: Heavy rainfall events have increased \nsignificantly more than the annual or the seasonal \ntotals have increased. This trend is predicted to \ncontinue and to strengthen over the next 30 years. \nFinding: The length of intraseasonal dry spells  \n(i.e., days between rainfall events) is predicted  \nto increase. \nImplication for landscape level and individual \nfarmer decisions: The recent trend of more frequent \nheavy rainfall in the Upper Midwest is expected to \ncontinue and intensify in future decades. Increased \nfrequency of heavy rainfall in past decades is not \na natural fluctuation, but is the \u201cnew normal\u201d and \nis expected to intensify. This is a robust result that \nis found under all climate modeling approaches. \nPredicted interaction of climate change with farm \nmanagement depends on the climate model that is \nused, mainly because of different changes in water \navailability predicted by different climate models.\nThese climatic trends set the context for evaluating \nand interpreting current management practices to \nunderstand how well fields, farms, and the regional \nlandscape can absorb the shocks associated with \nincreasing variability in weather and climate shifts. \nIncreased knowledge about threats to and opportunities \nfor productivity and environmental impacts on C, N, \nwater, and farmers under future climate scenario models \ncan guide farm practices and policy towards more \neffective adaptive management. \nRecommendation: Farmers need to be prepared for \nshortened windows of time for field operations and \nfor the impacts of more frequent heavy rainfall with \nlonger intraseasonal dry periods. \nRecommendation: Long-term adaptation measures \nwill need to accommodate changes in precipitation \nand can include practices that help compensate such \nas no-till and residue management, drainage water \nmanagement or cover crops to reduce erosion.\n2.1.3 Farmers\u2019 experiences and views on \nclimate change. A wide variety of adjustments and \nadaptations must occur if we are to successfully address \nshort and long-range challenges to the resilience of \ncropping systems and the broader agricultural landscape. \nA major question underlying the work of the Sustainable \nCorn CAP is how we can help farmers deal with \nproduction and environmental impacts and associated \nuncertainties caused by weather variability, taking into \nconsideration regional and local soil and environmental \nvariations. In order to answer this question, there was \na need to better understand farmers who are managing \ncorn-based systems. This meant seeking answers to \nquestions such as: What are farmers thinking about \nclimate change? What are their experiences with \nvariability in weather and extreme rain and drought \nevents? What are their concerns and perceptions of risk \nassociated with variability in weather and long term \nweather shifts? What are their current practices and to \nwhat extent are they adapting to changing conditions? \nSocial scientists on the team explored these questions \nby assessing farmer beliefs, risk perceptions, attitudes \ntoward adaptation and mitigation actions, and perceived \ncapacities to respond to climate change. Beliefs are \npeople\u2019s perceptions about the world and how it works. \nThey are statements about what is regarded as true and \nnot true. Beliefs originate from a variety of sources, \nranging from scientific fact, systematic or unsystematic \nobservations, learned behaviors, and unverified \nassumptions (Arbuckle et al. 2013; Church et al. 2015; \nLoy et al. 2013). Perceptions of risk are subjective \nassessments people use to understand and cope with \ndanger and uncertainties in their lives. Risk assessments, \nrational and intuitive, vary based on perceptions \nof whether there is a problem, the parameters of \nthe problem, exposure and sensitivities to the risk, \nprobabilities of loss, and resources available to address \nthe risk (Slovic 2009; Morton et al. In Review). Farmers \ncontinually assess and manage risk in their agricultural \noperations. These risks include production risks (yield \nloss), price/market volatility, institutional change \n(regulations), weather (short-term field management) \nand climate (longer-term investments), and social norm \nexpectations. Farmer capacities to respond to changing \nconditions are based on their current situation, access to \ndata, information and technology, and their confidence, \nability and skills to turn data into useable information \nabout how to best respond (Arbuckle et al. 2014).\nBeliefs\nAn Indiana farmer elaborated what he is thinking about \nclimate change:\n\u201c Now, I\u2019m not sure how much things are actually changing. When they talk about the world temperature \nchanging 2/10 of a degree in a year relative to... to what \nit has been, you know, historically. I don\u2019t know. I wish I \nhad a dinosaur around to ask him\u2026what kind of changes \nI should be looking at? I\u2019m just not too torn up about the \nweather and changes right there. But, as far as the drought \nthat happened [2012], you know, it didn\u2019t rain so I don\u2019t \nknow how any practice I could have made last year that \nwould have changed my outcome other than the level or \nthe type of crop insurance I would have bought. Other \nthan that... I tried my best. It went in better than I\u2019ve ever \nseen a crop go in and [I was] just tickled pink until it didn\u2019t \nrain. So that\u2019s just the way life is when you farm. It doesn\u2019t \nrain, you don\u2019t make money.\u201d \nFinding: Two-thirds of surveyed farmers believed \nclimate change is occurring. However, they differed \nin their beliefs about causality. Eight percent \nattributed climate change primarily to human \nactions; 33% to both human and natural causes, and \n25% to mostly natural causes. One-third of farmers \nthought there was not enough evidence to know \nwith certainty whether climate change is occurring \n(31%) or did not believe that it is (3.5%). \nFinding: Despite differences in beliefs about the \ncauses of climate change, a majority of farmers \nagreed or strongly agreed they had noticed more \nvariable or unusual weather on their farms over the \nlast five years. \nImplication to farmer risk assessments: Beliefs \nabout climate were associated with perceptions of \nrisk, and willingness to take action to mitigate and \nadapt to weather/climate conditions. Those who \nbelieved climate change was primarily caused by \nhuman activities were those most concerned and \nwilling to adjust their practices (Arbuckle et al. 2015).\nImplication to farmers moving out of current \nstatus quo: Farmers\u2019 uncertainty about projected \nclimate change impacts on their production systems \nwere associated with beliefs about the causality of \nclimate change, experiences with drought, concern \nabout heat stress on crops and their agricultural \ninformation network. These factors were \ninformation sources that reduced (or increased) \nperceptions of too much uncertainty (Morton et al. \nIn review).\nClimate & Managing Corn-Soybean Agroecosystems s 12\nExperience with weather\nFinding: Many farmers seem to use their \nexperiences with past weather as a baseline to make \nsense of current weather and projected weather in \norder to make good management decisions. Project \nmodels examining factors that influence decisions \nto implement no-till (NT), cover crops, and to \nplant more crops on highly erodible land (HEL) \nfind that actual past climate and precipitation can \nhave a significant effect on the type of management \nput in place. Further responses are local, since \nseasonal precipitation varies greatly across the upper \nMidwest and has a differential impact on the type of \nmanagement used (Morton et al. 2015).\nFinding: There is significant variability among \nfarmers in their beliefs about climate change \ncausality, experiences with drought and flooding, \nconcern about impacts of extreme events on the \nfarm enterprise, and assessments of risks and \nopportunities that change may bring. (Arbuckle  \net al. 2014)\nImplication for those working with farmers: \nWeather experiences and perceptions of risk \nmay increase willingness to adapt to climate  \nchange regardless of climate beliefs  \n(Arbuckle et al. 2015).\nRisk perceptions and uncertainty\nUncertainty about local weather conditions present \nchallenges to farmers making real time decisions about \nplanting, nitrogen fertilizer applications, herbicide \nand pest management, and harvest. These risks and \nuncertainties associated with variable climate and extreme \nweather events are direct and underlying factors that affect \ndaily and longer-term farm management decisions.  \nOne Wisconsin project farmer voiced his concern about \nthe unpredictability of weather: \n\u201cWell, my real concern about climate change is\u2026 the wind patterns and what that affects, rainfall, either \ngetting too much, too little, whatever. The fact that the \nMidwest, what we would consider the Corn Belt or the \nbread basket of the United States, is that way because we \nhave predictable rainfall and predictable weather and my \nconcern is unpredictability\u2026 which doesn\u2019t lend itself well \nto producing a crop or to planting for anything.\u201d\nA Michigan farmer acknowledged that uncertainty in \nweather was expected:\n\u201cThe only thing I trust is it\u2019s going to change. It\u2019s not going to be the same. Next year will not be ... like any year \nprevious, right? This summer won\u2019t be like any of the other \nsummers I\u2019ve experienced. It\u2019ll be different. And that\u2019s \nwhat makes it glorious to farm. Cause you don\u2019t get bored. \nYou\u2019ve just got to be ready.\u201d \nFinding: Beliefs, perceived risks, confidence, \nattitudes and current practices varied widely across \nthe upper Midwest. In Iowa, trust in environmental \nor agricultural interest groups as sources of climate \ninformation influenced the perceived climate risks \nto agriculture, and support for adaptation and/or \nmitigation responses (Arbuckle et al. 2015).\nImplication: Variations in trust and beliefs about \nclimate change can have direct effects on perceived \nrisks to the farm operation and potential changes  \nin practices.\nFinding: The majority of farmers in the upper \nMidwest perceive there is too much uncertainty \nabout the impacts of climate change to justify \nchanging their agricultural practices (Morton et al. \nIn review). \nImplication: Farmer uncertainty points to using \na \u201cwait and see\u201d approach as a rational adaptation \nstrategy until better, more locally accurate climate \ninformation and future consequences are available \nto guide decisions.\nAttitudes toward adaptation  \nand mitigation actions\nThe survey measured farmer attitudes regarding \npotential individual-level and societal responses to \nincreased weather variability. The survey provided \nrespondents with a number of statements about actions \nthat might be taken by individual farmers, farmers as \na group, private sector firms, extension, government \nagencies, and other actors. In general, farmers expressed \nfavorable attitudes toward adaptation actions, but \nfew farmers supported reduction of GHG emissions \n(Arbuckle et al. 2013; Loy et al. 2013).\nFinding: Most respondents believed farmers in \ngeneral (65%) and they themselves (58%) should \ntake additional steps to protect their farmland from \nincreased weather variability.\nFinding: Majorities of surveyed farmers agreed \nExtension (62%) and farm organizations (52%) \nshould help farmers prepare for increased weather \nvariability. Just 43% agreed state and federal agencies \nshould do the same.\n13\nClimate & Managing Corn-Soybean Agroecosystems s 14\nFinding: Less than one-fourth of respondents \nagreed they should reduce GHG emissions from \ntheir farms (23%) or that government should do \nmore to reduce GHG emissions (23%).\nFinding: Farmers who believed climate change \nwas occurring were more likely to support adaptive \naction, but even farmers who were uncertain about \nor did not believe in climate change supported \naction to adapt to increased weather variability.\nImplication: Extension and outreach should \nbe framed in terms of helping farmers adapt to \nincreased weather variability and extreme weather \n(refer to Volume 3).\nCapacity to adapt\nFinding: The biophysical situation (flooding, \ndrought, saturated soils, and/or having a river \nrun through the farm) and farmer\u2019s identities \n(conservationist and productivist) significantly \ninfluence field and farm management strategies to \nadapt (or not) to changing conditions.\nImplications: There is evidence that farmers are \npaying attention to the biophysical situation as well \nas are being guided by their own understandings \nof themselves as good farmers in making decisions \nabout their farm operation. \nRecommendations: This work suggests that \neducators and policymakers should focus on \ninterventions, incentives and policies that appeal \nthe farmer\u2019s conservationist identity to increase \nadaptations that protect the agroecosystem in the \nlonger term. More research is needed to better \nunderstand what activates identities, core values \nand beliefs and how some values are privileged over \nothers in adaptive decisions.\nFinding: Many farmers are confident that they \n have the knowledge, technical skills and financial \ncapacity available to adapt to future changes in \nclimate. A great majority of them are supportive of \nindividual, private sector and government action in \nsupport of adaptation.\nImplication: Farmers have a great deal of \nexperience with variability in weather and have \nsuccessfully addressed issues associated with \nthese changing conditions. This confidence seems \nto reduce stress and concerns about the impacts \nof changes in climate. Outreach that appeals to \nfarmers\u2019 skills and capacity to adapt to weather \nextremes may resonate with them.\nProject findings about current and projected upper \nMidwest climate patterns and an understanding of \nfarmers\u2019 beliefs about climate change, experiences with \nclimate hazards, perceptions of risk, and capacities to \nadapt suggest the following recommendations:\nRecommendation: To reduce farmers\u2019 uncertainty, \nincrease their access to and capacity to understand \nand interpret local historical and current weather \nand climate records.\nRecommendation: Give farmers opportunities to \nlearn how to use decision support tools that simulate \nthe effects of different climate scenarios, use of \ndifferent production practices and their impacts on \nproductivity, SOC and N stocks.\nRecommendation: Convey scientific probabilities \nusing confidence levels based on scientific evidence \nto help farmers more accurately interpret how  \nto incorporate scientific uncertainty into their \nproduction decision making. \nRecommendation: Focus on adaptation measures \nthat are consistent with farmers\u2019 concerns with \ncurrent experience of climate variability, such as \nmeasures that are effective in managing heavier \nbut less frequent precipitation. Because most \nfarmers do not attribute climate change to human \nactivity, farmer engagement strategies that focus  \non increasing capacity to deal with extreme or \nvariable-weather may be more effective  \nthan strategies focused on \u201cclimate change\u201d or \n\u201cglobal warming.\u201d \nProject social scientists found Midwest farmers have \nhighly heterogeneous perspectives about climate \nchange and associated risks (Arbuckle et al. 2014). Six \ndistinct classes of farmers were identified based on the \nvariations of beliefs about climate change, the degree \nto which they had experienced extreme weather, risk \nperceptions and attitudes toward public and private \nadaption, and mitigation action. These categories were \nlabeled the concerned (14%), the uneasy (25%), the \nuncertain (25%), the unconcerned (13%), the confident \n(18%), and the detached (5%). The farmers comprising \nthe concerned and the uneasy groups were relatively \nengaged in thinking about climate change, worried about \nthe potential impacts, and were supportive of public and \nprivate, individual, and collective action to address the \nrisks and causes of climate change. These farmers also \ntended to have experienced negative impacts of extreme \nweather in recent years. The uncertain class appeared \nto be less concerned, but tended to believe that climate \nchange is occurring, and were supportive of adaptation \nand mitigation at levels similar to those of the concerned \nand uneasy. Farmers who made up the unconcerned, the \nconfident, and the detached tended to not believe climate \nchange is occurring, expressed much less concern about \npotential risks, were more confident in their capacity to \nadapt, and were not as likely to support action. Except \nfor the confident, these subpopulations reported very \nlittle experience with adverse weather-related impacts on \ntheir farm operations over the previous five years. The \nsignificance of personal experience in many analyses of \nthe data suggests that as increased climate variability and \nextreme weather events become more visible, farmers \nmay become less uncertain and more pro-actively seek \nmanagement strategies to reduce perceived risks. \n2.2 CORN AND SOYBEAN PRODUCTION \nAND MANAGEMENT\nAlthough corn biomass has economic value for feed and \nbedding, and recently cellulosic energy, grain production \nper area is the primary measurement of productivity. \nThe amount of grain harvested each year is a function of \nthe environment and farm management impact on the \ngenetic potential of the hybrid or variety. Corn, soybean, \nand wheat are each well suited for production in the \nUpper Midwest, but differ in overall crop development, \ntype of stressors, length of time required for grain fill, and \nother production factors. Therefore, the impact of climate \nchange will vary within and across years due to the crops \ngrown, weather conditions experienced, management \npractices employed, and inherent site characteristics. \nThe impact on grain development and overall yield \nis a function of understanding how changing climate \npatterns impact the sensitivity and vulnerability of the \ncrops. For corn, the silking period is the most sensitive \nperiod and historically has received much attention \nby plant breeders to ensure successful pollination \nand fertilization occurs. Stressors such as heightened \ntemperatures, drought, or disease can be long-term in \nnature and can hasten grain fill, resulting in less starch \naccumulated and thus, lower yields. Soybean has an \noverlap in its development with the growth of leaves, \nflowers, and pods occurring simultaneously much of the \nseason. This growth pattern inherently lessens the impact \nof a one-time stress or event experienced by the crop \nbecause of its compensatory behavior. Flower abortion, \nhowever, occurs more frequently at higher temperatures. \nA stressful environment, especially related to moisture \navailability and temperatures (both air and soil), will \nreduce grain yields in all crops. \nFarmer specialization, knowledge and experience with \ncorn, soybean, and wheat production practices in the \nNsalambi Nikongolo, Lincoln Univ., inspects an insect sticky trap\nClimate & Managing Corn-Soybean Agroecosystems s 16\nUpper Midwest are key reasons these crops are produced \nhere efficiently. This knowledge is a valuable building \nblock as the region strives for greater sustainability \nand resilience. Use of these monoculture systems has \nseveral strong qualities primarily because the field can \nbe custom-managed to suit these crops as optimally as \npossible each growing season. However, the downtime \nbetween crops, most typically six months, is a long period \nfor the landscape to be exposed to weather events that \ncan lead to soil erosion, nutrient leaching, and fallow \nperiods that may impact overall system performance \nwhen taking into consideration environmental indicators. \nManagement strategies are needed that reduce the period \nwhen no living crops are on the landscape. Any new \nmanagement practice involves a learning curve, different \nrisks and challenges for the farmer. Our recommendations \nare derived from research findings and are aimed at \nfacilitating successful adoption of practices with which an \nindividual farmer may not be familiar. \n2.2.1. Analyses of plot and field  \nexperiment data by project scientists reveal a \nnumber of patterns that inform yield and management \nunder differing conditions.\nYield and Management \nFinding: Corn yields were sometimes reduced \nfollowing a cereal rye cover crop. Greater rye \nbiomass tended to be associated with greater corn \nyield reductions when there was less time between \ntermination and corn planting, colder temperatures, \nand greater precipitation.\nImplications for farmers: To manage a cereal \nrye cover crop before corn, terminate the rye \nwhen small and a minimum of 2 weeks before \nplanting corn. This recommendation is congruent \nwith the Midwest Cover Crops Council (MCCC) \ntargeting a rye height of 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) \nat termination. This can help reduce risks from \nallelopathy, insects, and N immobilization.\nRecommendation for farmers: Use planting and \nproduction practices that enhance early season corn \ngrowth to help eliminate potential corn grain yield \npenalty from a cereal rye cover crop. Corn planters \nshould have attachments and proper setup. Some \nstates recommend starter N for corn when planting \ninto cereal rye cover crop or no-till.\nFinding: Soybean grain yield was not increased or \ndecreased when planted following a winter cereal \nrye cover crop, no matter the amount of rye growth \nor the number of days planted after rye termination.\nImplication for farmers: Soybean crops can be \nplanted the same day as cereal rye termination or \nany time after termination without detrimental \neffects on grain yield.\nFinding: Cereal rye cover crop growth varied widely \nacross the region and across years. This was due to \nclimate variation across the region, weather in a \ngiven year, timing of rye seeding and termination, \nand specific management practices utilized.\nRecommendation for agricultural researchers \nand funders: There is a need for more research \nand experimentation to improve the practicality \nand reliability of rye cereal cover crop seeding and \nestablishment due to the regional and within  \nyear variability.\nRecommendation for farmers and land managers: \nAdditional site specific on-farm experimentation is \nneeded to discover effective management strategies \nto establish and grow cereal rye cover crops within \nthe time windows (fall and spring) available between \nmanagement of grain crops.\nFinding: Averaged across all seven sites, annual \ncorn yields were similar between tillage systems \nduring all years except 2012. In 2012, yields in \nconventional tillage were 9 and 8% less than yields \nin no-till for the continuous corn and corn-\nsoybean rotations, respectively. This was due to low \nprecipitation and high air temperatures during the \n2012 growing season.\nImplication for farmers: In years with stressful \ngrowing conditions, particularly high daily \ntemperatures and limited moisture, no-till systems \nwith residue mulch may have a yield advantage \nrelative to tilled systems due to inherent changes in \nthe soil and plant microclimate. \nFinding: Five-year average corn yields of the \ncorn-soybean rotation did not differ between \nconventional tillage and no-till for five of the seven \nresearch sites evaluated. \nImplication for farmers: When used as part of a long-\nterm (3+ yrs.) soil conservation strategy, no-till often \ncan be implemented without yield penalty compared \nto more aggressive tillage systems in a corn-soybean \nrotation under many upper Midwest environments.\nFinding: Five-year average soybean yields of the corn-\nsoybean rotation did not differ between conventional \ntillage and no-till for four of six research sites (one of \nthe seven sites was not included in the analysis). The \n17\ntwo research sites with differences had greater yields \nin no-till compared to conventional tillage. \nRecommendation to extension and crop advisors: \nEncourage use of no-till to improve soil structure, \nincrease long-term infiltration and reduce runoff \nand erosion based on soil, slope, other field \ncharacteristics and crop.\nProject findings associated with corn and soybean \nproduction systems reveal important nuances in \nemerging research on cover crop use and reaffirm prior \nresearch on tillage. Use of no-till can reduce vulnerability \nto varying amounts and intensities of precipitation \nand improve soil moisture retention. For production \ncapabilities, additional cover crop research is needed to \nmove towards established best management practices \nfor regions that effectively improve the management, \ntiming of seeding, and springtime termination, as well \nas variations in climatic and geographic responses. The \nsoil health benefits of no-till and cover cropping may not \nalways be translated into direct yield benefits because \nthe latter is strongly influenced by conditions during \nthe growing season. Yet the ecological and ecosystem \nbenefits of these best management practices must be \nconsidered in an overall production strategy.  \n2.2.2 Management practices of Upper \nMidwest farmers reflect attempts to address the \nsometimes competing goals of sustaining or improving \nproductivity, environmental, economic, and social \nindicators. Accomplishing these goals present difficult \ntrade-offs for farmers as they seek to manage under \nincreasingly variable weather and changing climate. \nIn order to understand receptivity to new practices and \ncapacity to adapt the corn-based system, the project \nfocused on medium and large-scale farmers whose \noperations represent a large portion of the region. Social \nscientists studied farmers with a minimum of 80 acres \n(32 hectares) of corn production and U.S. $100,000 \ngross sales whose farming operations were in the 22 \nwatersheds with the highest acres of corn harvested \nin 2007 in the Upper Midwest (see Section 1.4 for full \ndescription of methods). Farmers surveyed, on average, \nowned and rented a total of 1025 acres (415 hectares), \nwith a little more than 59% of those acres rented. \nFarmers reported producing corn for diverse markets: \ncommodity, sweetener, export, feed (81.3%); ethanol \n(64.5%); livestock-silage (39.4%); specialty or value-\nadded including organic (4.5%); seed (5.5%); and other \n(3.6%). Over half of the farmers produced corn for at \nleast two different markets. Ninety-eight percent of the \nfarmers graduated from high school (GED equivalent) \nand one-quarter had a 4-year or higher college degree. \nTwenty-six percent planned to retire in the next five \nyears. Almost 55% of all farmers anticipated a family \nmember would take over the farm operation whenever \nthey decided to retire. \nA little more than one-fourth of the random sampled \nfarmers reported using cover crops in 2011, with most \nof those planting cover crops on 40% or less of their land \n(Table 1). Soil types and slope vary considerably across \nthe region. Some landscapes have steep slopes that are \nhighly erodible land (HEL), and many farmers were \nplanting these hillsides to a cultivated crop and used \nmanagement practices such as limited tillage or no-till \nto reduce water runoff and soil erosion. Nearly 60% of \nfarmers reported planting at least some HEL to crops \nin 2011 (Morton et al. 2015). Just over 60% of farmers \nreported using no-till on at least some of their land, with \n18% reporting using it on 100% of their land. Forty-\none percent of the farmers used diversified rotations \nthat included small grains, forages, or other crops on \ntheir own land. Most farmers reported using nutrient \nmanagement strategies such as testing of soil, manure \nPractice Mean\nStandard \nDeviation 0% 1-40% 41-59% 60-99% 100%\nArtificially drained through tile or \nother methods\n49.3 40.0 22.9 22.7 9.0 22.8 22.6\nNo-till 37.5 38.8 38.3 18.5 15.3 9.9 18.0\nPlanted to cover crops 6.4 16.5 73.3 21.8 2.6 1.1 1.2\nHighly erodible land that was \nplanted to crops\n24.5 33.1 41.0 34.0 6.5 10.9 7.6\nTABLE 1  |  Summary statistics for farmer response variables.\nReprinted by Permission, ASA, CSSA, SSSA.

Loy. 2015. \nUpper Midwest climate variations: Farmer responses to excess water risks. 44:810-822. http://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2014.08.0352\nand plant tissue to determine fertilizer rates on their own \n(81%) and rented (71%) land. A similar percentage of \nfarmers used integrated pest management techniques. \nA Minnesota project farmer explained his use of soil \ntests to guide nitrogen management: \n\u201cAnd so to get a handle on nitrogen and rates, for the most part, but then also looking at P & K,\u2026 (we\u2019re) \nlooking... for cost effectiveness and where we want to be. \nSo we... soil test and it\u2019s fairly complicated. The more we \nknow, the less we know on certain places.\u201d \nAlmost one-quarter to one-third reported to not be \nfamiliar with three technologies that could help them \nmanage inputs (irrigation efficiency best management \npractices, 24%; water control structures, 23%; and \nnitrogen canopy sensors, 34%). \n2.3 INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT\nIncreased carbon dioxide (CO2) and subsequent change \nin temperature are predicted to affect plant-eating insects \n(Bale et al. 2002) and possibly crop pests (Cannon et \nal. 1998). Although day-length is the greatest stimulus \nfor triggering the start or end of overwintering, insect \ndevelopment and migration can be predicted in \ntemperate regions because insects are cold blooded. \nIncreases in temperature are likely to speed their \ndevelopment and improve overwintering success in \ntemperate regions (Bale and Hayward 2010). However, \nlong periods of high temperatures may lower survival, \nespecially if temperatures exceed upper lethal limits. If \nthe maximum daily temperatures decrease, as predicted \nfor the Midwest (see Section 2.1), a changing climate \nstill may negatively affect insects. For example, if the \naverage temperature remains consistently higher during \nkey points in an insect\u2019s development, this may interfere \nwith development. Finally, the changes in temperature \nand resulting impact on insect herbivores (i.e. crop pests) \nis complicated, as many suffer significant mortality from \npredation and parasitism from other insects, which in \nturn may respond to a changing climate.\nBeyond existing pests, invasive species continue to \nnegatively affect agriculture (Liebhold and Tobin 2008) \nespecially within the U.S. Elevated temperatures can \nexpand or shift the range available for invasive insects. \nFor example, soybean aphids are sensitive to changes \nin temperature (McCornack et al. 2004) and combined \nwith its natural enemies, this becomes a model system \nfor exploring the possible impact of climate change on \nan insect pest. Elevated CO2 increases soybean aphid \npopulation (Dermody et al. 2008), not because of CO2 \ndirectly, but rather from an increase in temperature \nat the leaf surface (O\u2019Neill et al. 2011), and affected \nplant physiology (O\u2019Neill et al. 2010a). Anticipating the \nimpact of increasing temperature on aphids and their \nnatural enemies is challenging. Several efforts to model \nthe relationship between aphid and natural enemies \nhave suggested biological control may be strengthened \n(Abbott et al. 2014) or destabilized (Meisner et al. 2014) \ndepending upon the life history traits of the prey and \nnatural enemies. To improve future modeling efforts, \nempirical data are needed, especially in the context \nof farming practices that may be adopted due to \nclimate change, if pest managers are to be proactive in \npreventing future insect outbreaks.\n2.3.1 Farmer response to climate change also \nmay affect pest pressure. Specifically, farmers may \nuse cover crops and extended rotations to improve soil \nquality and prevent erosion. However, cover crops may \nproduce a \u2018green-bridge\u2019 during the spring for migrating \npests to better inhabit spring-seeded crops. \nFinding: An increased risk from true armyworm \n(Mthimna unipuncta) occurred in Iowa due to the \nuse of cover crops in corn (Dunbar et al. 2016). \nUnfortunately a compensatory increase in predatory \ninsects did not occur with the presence of a cover \ncrop in corn or soybean (Dunbar et al. in review \nA). This increased pest pressure risk occurred even \nwhen farmers were following recommendations to \nremove the cover crop to prevent a green-bridge \nfrom forming.\nImplication for integrated pest management \nfunding: This pest can be managed, but will come at a \ncost for a practice that requires governmental support \nto ensure adoption. It is not clear to what extent other \nmitigation practices will increase the likelihood of \npreviously uncommon pests causing outbreaks.\nExtending rotations beyond continuous corn to include \nmore frequent inclusion of other crops can have multiple \nbenefits, especially in light of a changing climate. Crop \nrotation is recommended for the most important \ninsect pest of corn, the western corn rootworm (WCR, \nDiabrotica virgifera virgifera). Areas within the Upper \nMidwest have a higher percentage of continuous corn \nacreage due to a host of reasons including soil type, \nhigh market demand, and adoption of WCR resistant \ncorn. Although most farmers in the upper Midwest use \nBt-corn with specific proteins that target this pest, the \noveruse of this tactic has led to resistance to multiple \nBt-toxins (Gassmann et al. 2011). A hopeful outcome \nfrom this situation is that farmers will return to rotation, \nwhich could reduce both the impact of the WCR and the \nClimate & Managing Corn-Soybean Agroecosystems s 18\n19\noccurrence of Bt-resistant populations. Unfortunately, \nalthough the former is true, we did not see evidence \nthat crop rotation reduced the occurrence of resistant \npopulations (Dunbar et al. in press). Furthermore, \nextending rotations within a corn production system did \nnot affect beneficial insect communities within either \ncorn or soybeans (Dunbar et al. in review B).\n2.3.2 Weed pressure. Almost 50% of upper \nMidwest farmers surveyed by the project in 2011 \nwere concerned or very concerned about increased \nweed pressure. Similar concerns were expressed about \nincreased insect pressure (50%) and higher incidence of \ncrop disease (50%) (Loy et al. 2013).\n2.4 WATER CYCLE \nThe continuous movement of water throughout the \nearth is the hydrological cycle as it moves from one \nstorage location to another by processes of precipitation, \ninfiltration, runoff, and evaporation. Its storage \nlocation depends greatly on climatic factors, especially \ntemperature changes. The water balance refers to a \nchange in internal moisture storage as balanced by \nmoisture fluxes into and out of a particular location \n(Bowling 2012; Laws et al. 2014). Over multi-year \nperiods with little to no change in the hydrologic system, \nthe field-scale water balance describes how precipitation \ncauses runoff, drain flow, ground water recharge and \nevapotranspiration. Increasing precipitation intensity \ncan generate more surface runoff and lessen the amount \nin the soil profile. Storage of snow and soil ice decreases \nduring warmer winter periods and thereby, increases \nwinter surface runoff, drain flow, and groundwater \nrecharge. Changes in the winter months can change the \nhistoric soil moisture and temperatures at the start of \na growing season. Surface runoff, especially on sloped \ntopographies, is erosive and can lead to soil movement \ndown slope, off-field and off-farm causing sedimentation \nof nearby creeks, rivers, and lakes.\nManagement of the water balance in corn-soybean \nproduction is designed to remove excess water at the \nfield and watershed scales as well as retain soil moisture \nin preparation for the growing season. In rainfed \nclimates, like the Upper Midwest, surface ditching and \nsubsurface tile drainage are used to improve soil aeration \nin the root zone of growing plants and crop yields on \npoorly-drained soils. Potential benefits of drainage \non naturally poorly drained soils are reduced erosion, \nearlier planting date, improved seed germination and \nestablishment and more rigorous plant growth and \nhealth. (Laws et al. 2014; Strock 2016).\nControlled drainage refers to the practice of limiting the \noutflow from a subsurface drainage system through the \nuse of a control structure at the system outlet. It is one \nmechanism that researchers are studying to discover \nunder what conditions farmers can use it to adapt \nto increased variability in precipitation. It may allow \nfarmers to \u201csave\u201d subsurface water for later use by the \ncrop when needed.\nThere are a number of concerns associated with drainage \nthat need to be carefully addressed. Tile drainage during \nperiods of extreme precipitation and lack of vegetation has \nhad an unintended consequence of off-field and off-farm \nN, phosphorous (P), and sediment losses. Nitrate loads \nfrom tile-drained fields have been shown to contribute to \nhypoxic conditions in the Gulf of Mexico (Alexander et \nal. 2008; Frankenberger 2012; Laws et al. 2014). Attention \nto practices that reduce nitrate loss while maintaining \ndrainage functions during the cropping season are of high \nimportance at the individual farm and watershed levels.\n2.4.1 Project findings based on plot and \nfield experiments reveal a number of implications \nand recommendations for farmers who have or will \ninstall drain tile in their fields. This pertains to the use of \ncontrolled drainage to retain water and decrease nitrate \nloss during the non-growing season.\nFinding: The seasonal timing of drain flow differs \nbetween the northwest portion of the region \n(Minnesota and Iowa), where most flow occurs \nin April-June, and the eastern portion (Ohio and \nIndiana) where flow can occur throughout the \nwinter. The timing is correlated with the quantity of \nwinter precipitation and the amount of annual soil \nfreezing, with more soil frost leading to later drain \nflow, but greater winter precipitation resulting in \nearlier drain flow. Regionally, the drain flow was \nmost correlated with (1) winter precipitation, and \n(2) annual precipitation minus evapotranspiration, \nas influenced by soil type. The volume of drainage \nand subsequent nitrate load from subsurface \ndrainage is strongly influenced by these two climate \nvariables allowing for USDA and land managers to \ntarget regions for controlled drainage.\nImplication to drainage contractors and farmers: \nAddition of controlled drainage infrastructure \nshould be targeted to locations where it is most \neffective based on drain flow timing and landscape \ncharacteristics. Less benefit is achieved from \ncontrolled drainage infrastructure in areas where a \nsubstantial portion of total annual drain flow occurs \nin spring, when stored drainage water must be \nreleased to completed field work.\nFinding: Controlled drainage reduced annual drain \nflow by 3-68% in Iowa, 7-49% in Indiana, 12-68% in \nOhio, and 25-100% in Minnesota. Controlled drainage \ndid not result in substantial soil moisture increases.\na) Controlled drainage raised the water table on \naverage, but differences in the number of hours \nduring the growing season in which the water \ntable was within 12 inches (30 cm) of the surface \n(which might be detrimental) and between 12 \nand 24 inches (30 and 60 cm) of the surface \n(which might be beneficial) were not statistically \nsignificant in Iowa or Ohio, and only significant in \none of two sites in Indiana.\nb) Controlled drainage increased volumetric \nsoil water content in the profile during July and \nAug by an average of 0.3 inches (0.8 cm) in Ohio \nand 0.4 to 2.2 inches (1.1 to 5.7 cm) in Indiana, \nand reduced total hours of soil moisture deficit \nover the entire year. However, growing season \nmetrics of soil moisture deficit that included the \nmagnitude of the deficit did not show significantly \ndifferent levels of soil moisture stress.\nImplications to drainage contractors and farmers: \nControlled drainage infrastructure can retain water \nin the soil profile and may be beneficial in years \nwhen moisture stress occurs. Careful site selection \nand design are necessary to limit seepage from \nthe system to improve the likelihood of increasing \ngrowing season soil moisture.\nAlthough drainage water management adoption is \nlimited, it is being encouraged through training in the \ndesign and installation of drainage management systems, \neducation of landowners, and financial incentives \nprovided by state and federal conservation programs. \nIndividual landowners and farmers\u2019 decisions have \nlandscape-scale impacts on soil and water resources. \nA number of recommendations for future research, \neducation and policy development are: \nRecommendation to extension and crop advisors: \nIncrease engagement and education of landowners \nand farmers to help them assess their drainage \nchallenges and explore solutions that address their \nindividual field and farm concerns and watershed \nscale impacts associated with nutrient loss and  \nwater quality.\nRecommendation to extension and crop advisors: \nGiven the uncertainty in future climate and local \nweather variability, farmers should implement \nmethods that are appropriate to localized conditions \nthat affect water availability.\nRecommendation to policymakers: Develop \npolicies that encourage drainage water management; \nJeff Strock, Univ. of Minnesota, sets up water quality \nsampling equipment\n21\nespecially targeting cropping regions with greatest \npotential to benefit from improved management and \nhighlighting importance of the timing of drainage \nfor improving water quality.\n2.4.2 Upper Midwest farmer responses \nto managing water. Variability in climate and \nextreme weather events means farmers need strategies \nto manage their crops so they have enough water to \nproduce healthy plants, but not too much. Forty-seven \npercent of farmers agreed that increased investments in \nagricultural drainage systems were needed to prepare \nfor increased precipitation (Loy et al. 2013); with almost \n68% of farmers within the Western Lake Erie HUC 6 \n(Hydrologic Unit Code) watershed calling for more \ndrainage. Seventeen percent of farmers across the region \nthought more investments in irrigation systems were \nneeded to prepare for more frequent drought with the \npercentage of agreement in the Middle Platte HUC 6 \n(47%) and Southeastern Lake Michigan HUC 6 (36%).\nFinding: More than 75% of farmers have creeks, \nstreams, or rivers running through or along the land \nthey farm. Nearly three-fourths reported experience \nwith saturated soils and 37% reported significant \nflooding from a stream or river on some of the land \nthey farmed at some point during the five years \nprior to the survey (2007-2011). Slightly less than \n30% had experienced significant drought on the \nland they farmed in the past five years.\nFinding: Farmer concern about excess water \nvaried across the region. In the Western Lake Erie \nwatershed (OH, MI, IN), 72% of farmers were \nconcerned or very concerned about more frequent, \nextreme rains and 64% were concerned or very \nconcerned about increases in saturated soils, \ncompared to 31% and 14%, respectively, in the Big \nBlue watershed (NE, KS).\nA Wisconsin farmer-cooperator reflects on the \nvariability of weather from year to year:\n\u201c[The weather is] all over the board from last year\u2019s drought and heat to years of wet and cold. I mean,\u2026 you\u2019ll \nnever have an average year; it\u2019s always one extreme or the \nother and it\u2019s just how do you try to work around it.\u201d \nA Michigan farmer-cooperator responds to extreme \nvariations in precipitation in his locale: \n\u201cWe seem to be having these extremes from one year to the next. Like this year, it\u2019s way too wet. Last year, it \nwas plenty dry. The year before that, it was cold and wet \ninitially, and then it got too dry after that\u2026 You need to \ndo the best you can so that you\u2019re not locked into a corner. \nObviously, you can\u2019t do anything about the rain but, if you \ndon\u2019t work your ground to death and you leave residue on \nthe ground...you\u2019re going to conserve more moisture than  \nif it\u2019s wide open and getting baked by the sun.\u201d \nImplications of variability in precipitation: The \ntiming, amount and intensity of precipitation during \nthe growing season will have significant effects on \nwhether the crop germinates, becomes established, \nand develops to maximize its yield potential. \nRay Arritt (left), Iowa State Univ., and  \nDennis Todey, South Dakota State Univ.\nClimate & Managing Corn-Soybean Agroecosystems s 22\nFinding: Almost 75% of farmers in the region \nreported at least some cropland they farmed was \nartificially drained and 23% reported 100% of \ntheir land was drained (see Table 1, Morton et al. \n2015). Farmers in the western portion of the region \nstudied (Nebraska) and Southeastern Lake Michigan \nwere the most likely to irrigate portions of their \nfarmland. Middle Platte, Loup, and Big Blue farmers \nreported irrigating on average 78%, 56%, and 57% \nrespectively of their owned lands. Southeastern Lake \nMichigan farmers reported irrigating on average \n17% of owned land.\nFinding: Growing season precipitation varied across \nthe six subregions of the Upper Midwest (2007-2011) \nand was significantly associated with variations in \nmanagement practices (cover crops, tillage, drainage, \nand planting to HEL) (Morton et al. 2015).\nImplications for farmers: Regional climate \nconditions may not well represent individual \nfarmers\u2019 actual and perceived experiences with \nchanging climate conditions. \nImplications to climate science: Accurate climate \ninformation downscaled to localized conditions has \npotential to influence specific adaptation strategies.\nFinding: Increased wetness in the last five years \nrelative to the past 40 years was associated with \nwater management, NT, cover crops and planting \ncrops on HEL. Further, the differential responses in \npractices were associated with geographic locations, \npersonal experiences with saturated soils and \nflooding, marginality of soils and diversification of \ncorn markets (Morton et al. 2015).\nImplications at field, farm, and watershed scales: \nExtensive drainage of crop land is practiced across \nmuch of the Upper Midwest and is one strategy \nfarmers seem to be using to deal with heavy rain \nevents so they can get into their fields for planting, \nearly season application of nitrogen, and harvest. \nExcess water not only can affect crop growth and \nproductivity but also influences off-field, off-farm soil \nerosion and N losses with unintended consequences \nto water quality and future soil productivity.\nRecommendations to farmers: Experiment with \na suite of practices to better manage your cropping \nsystem with close attention to technologies that \nmitigate excess water, soil erosion, and nutrient \nlosses during the growing season. \n2.4.3. Landscape-wide modeling offers \na region-wide view of how conservation \npractices could affect downstream  \nwater quality.\nRecommendations to policymakers: Government \ncost share and other conservation practice support \nprograms should focus on identification of the \nmost cost-effective locations for installing/adopting \nconservation practices for a given watershed or region.\n2.5 NITROGEN SYSTEM\nNitrogen (N) is an essential nutrient for plant growth \nand often is the limiting nutrient in corn-based systems \n(Sawyer 2012). Although abundant in nature, most N \nis not in a form that plants can take up and must be \nconverted to plant available ammonium or nitrate. This \nmay be accomplished by either atmospheric N2 fixation \nby plant/microbe symbiosis or by industrial fertilizer \nmanufacture. Ammonium (NH4) can be biologically \nconverted to nitrite (NO2) and then rapidly to nitrate \n(NO3). Nitrate is highly mobile in the soil and easily \nleaches through the hydrologic system during times of \nthe year when growing plants are not on the landscape. \nDenitrification occurs when soils are saturated and \nnitrogen is lost from the soil into the atmosphere. This \nis a biological process that converts nitrate (NO3) into \ndinitrogen (N2), nitric oxide (NO) or nitrous oxide \n(N2O) gases. Dinitrogen gas is inert in the air (a main \ncomponent of air), but nitrous oxide is a greenhouse gas.\nThe complex pathways and reactions of nitrogen as it \npasses between soil, air, microbes, plants, and humans \nis called the N cycle (Sawyer 2012). In soils, microbes \ncreate many of these reactions; many processes can occur \nsimultaneously, and the resulting forms of nitrogen \nmay behave very differently than the previous forms of \nN. The management of N fertilizer in corn production \nimpacts timing and availability of N for plant growth \nand whether it is lost through water flows or to the \natmosphere. During wet springs in fields with bare soils, \nnitrogen applied through fertilizer applications or from \nnatural soil processes can be lost from the system. This \nmay result in lower crop yields, economic loss, and \nincreased levels of local and downstream N in water \nsystems (Laws et al. 2014). \nA range of approaches are available to maintain good \nN supply to crops while reducing N losses to water and \nair. Some involve management of nitrogen fertilizer \n(N timing, N rate, N source) while others involve \npractices such as cover crops and controlled drainage as \ndiscussed in this report. For example, cover crops grow \nduring seasons of the year when the cash crop has been \nharvested and the field is fallow. The use of a cover crop \nprovides vegetation that can actively take up nutrients \nsuch as N, thereby reducing N loss.\n23\n2.5.1 Soil nitrate. Analyses of project data based on \nplot and field experiments reveal a number of findings \nthat help the project research team better understand the \nsoil N cycle and the influence of climate. These findings \nhave implications for some of the management options \navailable to farmers.\nFinding: Total N uptake by the cereal rye cover \ncrop increased as the cover crop growth increased. \nThe cereal rye cover crop reduced soil nitrate-N \nconcentrations in the spring, with the amount  \nof reduction weakly correlated to the amount of \nrye biomass and rye N content. Cereal rye also \nreduced soil nitrate-N concentrations in the fall at \nsome sites where measured, in spite of relatively \nlittle fall growth.\nImplications: Total nitrogen uptake by the cereal \nrye cover crop increased as growth of the cover crop \nincreased. With a crop on the landscape during \nperiods without a cash crop, the soil nitrate-N \nconcentration was reduced in spring and fall when \ncompared to soil nitrate-N with no rye cover crop. \nRecommendations to extension and crop  \nadvisors: Promote greater cover crop use to reduce \nNO3- leaching; engage the industry to accelerate \neffective technologies that integrate row crop and \ncover crop combinations.\nImplications to farmers: The rye cover crop system \nshould be managed to maximize fall cover crop \ngrowth and have proper management in the spring \nbefore establishment of the cash crop. However, \nmaximizing cover crop growth could be a tradeoff as \nthat could increase risk of reduced corn yield. \nFinding: Modeling results indicate climate change \nwill bring about precipitation changes in future spring \nseasons. Approximately 22% of future springs (April \nto June) will have a >20% increase in precipitation \ncompared to the historical mean. This could cause a \nshift toward more NO3- loss in spring that may not be \nalleviated entirely by split N applications.\nFinding: Model results indicate NO3- leaching \nis expected to increase with climate change. \nThis is because of increased soil organic matter \ndecomposition occurring from increased \ntemperatures. The increase in nitrate leaching and \ndecrease in soil organic matter are reduced when \ncover crops or extended rotations are implemented.\nFinding: Modeling hypothetical adoption of \ncover crops across 95% of the cropland in the \nUpper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB) and Ohio- \nTennessee River Basin (OTRB) resulted in total \nmean annual reductions (1981 to 2000) across the \ntwo regions of total N of about 18% to 21%, total \nP of about 15% to 21% and large reductions in the \nNorthern Gulf of Mexico (NGM) hypoxic zone.\nRecommendation: Cover crops have been shown to \nbe effective in field studies for mitigating NO3- and \nsediment losses for a variety of cropland landscapes. \nOur simulation results of extensive adoption of \ncover crops across the Upper Midwest region \nconfirm this, and point to the need for wider cover \ncrop adoption by producers in the region.\n2.5.2 Nitrate movement to water. The value \nobtained in using a water control structure is its potential \ninfluence on the total nitrogen exiting the system. A \nfarmer can manage the drainage outlet during parts of \nthe year when a higher water table will not harm the \ncrop, and may benefit the crop, and thereby, reduce the \nnitrate load to ditches and streams. This nitrate load \nreduction is due primarily to the reduced drain flow \nvolume and potentially higher denitrification from \nanaerobic soil conditions.\nFinding: Controlled drainage reduced NO3- load \n(which is the quantity of most interest for nutrient \nreduction, calculated as NO3- concentration x drain \nflow). Ranges: 11-72% in Iowa; 30% in Indiana; \n12-70% in Ohio; 30-100% in Minnesota. Controlled \ndrainage, unlike some other practices such as cover \ncrops, should not be expected to reduce nitrate \nconcentration in tile drains but rather reduce loads \nthrough decreasing the flow.\nImplications: Controlled drainage can reduce offsite \nNO3- loss to surface water from drained cropland. \nThe systems do not reduce the NO3- concentration \nin tile drains; rather a reduction in nitrate loss is a \nresult of reduced drain flow from the land.\nRecommendations to farmers and crop advisors: \nTile-drained areas are vulnerable to nitrate loss. \nFarms can implement conservation approaches \nappropriate to their climate, landscape, and \ncropping patterns. \nThe nitrogen, water, and carbon cycles are interrelated, \nalong with crop productivity, so alterations in one will \nimpact others.\nFinding: Model results indicate by targeting \ncropland conservation investments to the most \ncost-effective location and extent of coverage in \nthe Mississippi-Atchafalaya River basin, northern \nGulf of Mexico (NGM) hypoxic zone goals can be \nClimate & Managing Corn-Soybean Agroecosystems s 24\nreached at less than half the cost of non-targeted \nconservation practices. It is important to note, \nhowever, that limitations in site suitability exist \nbecause of low slope requirements. \nRecommendations to policymakers: Conservation \nagency policies need to encourage implementation \nof practices such as controlled drainage, which may \nnot have an economic benefit, possibly through \nincentive/cost share programs that continue beyond \nthree years and pay more than a portion of costs.\n2.5.3. Greenhouse gases (GHG) include an array \nof naturally occurring and human-synthesized chemical \ncompounds (Castellano 2012). Agriculture directly \naccounts for 10-12% of total global anthropogenic GHG \nemissions and indirectly 17-30% is associated with \nland use changes (US EPA 2015). Nitrous oxide (N2O) \nproduction from agricultural soil management accounts \nfor 35-50% of all U.S. agricultural GHG emissions and \nhas been a focus within the Sustainable Corn project. The \nproject gathered and analyzed data on N2O emissions \nfrom corn and soybean systems at 18 sites to discern \ninfluence from various management practices. \nFinding. Drainage had no consistent effect on N2O \nemissions (mass N2O/area/time) over 10+ site years \nof data. Patterns of N2O loss from year-to-year \ncould not be consistently correlated to differences in \nsurface soil moisture. \nImplication: Due to year-to-year variation in \nweather, drainage did not have a consistent effect on \nN2O emissions. \nFinding. A cereal rye cover crop, as managed in this \nproject (herbicide termination, no incorporation, \nno tillage) had no consistent effect on direct N2O \nemissions in the corn or soybean phases of the corn-\nsoybean rotation. However, indirect N2O emissions \nresulting from NO3- leaching were not considered. \nImplication: On average, cover crops increased \ndirect N2O emissions from the soil surface by \napproximately 10% relative to no cover crops, but \nindirect N2O emissions resulting from leaching \nof NO3- were not considered. Moreover, more \nmeasurements in the late fall and early spring when \ncover crops are actively growing may reveal the \npositive effect is a spurious result due to lack of more \ncomprehensive measurements.\nFinding. Cereal rye cover crop and drainage \nexperiments had no consistent effect on N2O direct \nemissions from the soil surface. A reduction in GHG \nemissions, specifically N2O, from systems that \nincorporate cover crops cannot be assumed. More \nresearch is needed.\nFinding. N2O emissions from corn were greater  \nthan those from soybean or wheat. Wheat and \nsoybean emitted 30-70% less N2O than corn \n(massN2O/area/time). \nImplication for policymakers: To reduce N2O \nemissions in corn-based cropping systems, \nreplacement of corn with another crop, such as \nsoybean, wheat, or perennial crops will typically \nachieve greater reduction than what can be achieved \nsolely through improved crop management practices \nof the corn phase, such as N fertilizer optimization. \nRecommendation: A change in crop rotations to \ninclude greater cash crop diversity, such as soybean or \nwheat, will reduce N2O emissions compared to corn. \nFinding. The application of N fertilizer increased \nN2O emissions from the soil up to 2.5 months after \napplication, especially when soils were warm and \nwet. Sensor-based variable-rate sidedress N reduced \nN2O emissions compared to standard uniform \npreplant N field-level rates based on initial results \nand site modeling.\nJoe Lauer, University of Wisconsin, works with two next generation \nscientists\n25\nImplication to farmers: Applying N fertilizer in-\nseason with sensor-based variable rate technology, \nrather than using whole field uniform rate \nrecommendations, may reduce N2O emissions early in \nthe season resulting in lower total annual emissions.\n2.5.4. Upper Midwest farmers\u2019 perceptions \nand selection of practices to manage N \nvary across the region. Farmer surveys and interviews \noffer insights into what farmers are thinking about the \nrelationships among agricultural fertilizer use, N in \nwater, and their management practices.\nFinding: Just one-third of random sample \nsurveyed farmers agreed or strongly agreed with \nthe statement, \u201cnutrients and sediments from \nagriculture have negative impacts on water quality \nin their state.\u201d A similarly low proportion of farmers \nwere concerned or very concerned about the \nincreased loss of nutrients into waterways.\nImplications: Despite the fact that nutrient loss \nfrom agriculture is negatively impacting surface \nwater quality in all surveyed watersheds, nearly two-\nthirds of farmers in the region were not aware of \nthose negative impacts on water quality.\nA South Dakota project farmer elaborates his view on \nthe problem of N in the water:\n\u201c\u2026 nitrates in Minnesota and the Dakotas [were] here long before commercial fertilizers were even used. And so \nwe got to keep in mind that\u2019s a part of the nitrogen cycle \nand that these nutrients cycle over time and... nitrates \nhappen to be soluble and... move with the water. And in a \nyear like last year [2012] where there\u2019s less water, they get \nconcentrated. And that is probably more the problem, the \nDaren Mueller (left), Iowa State Univ., and Bryan \nOverstreet, Purdue Univ., measure the plant \npopulation in a soybean field\namount of water that we had last year rather than just the \ntile structure... So we\u2019ve got to keep that balance in mind \nand... make sure that we\u2019re not harming the environment \nbut, at the same time,... we need to be able to produce \nagricultural products.\u201d \nAn Iowa project farmer says he does not have much \ncontrol over where nitrogen goes: \n\u201cSo everybody gets up in arms\u2026 and they don\u2019t understand Mother Nature\u2019s process\u2026 Whether it be my \nprocess to why I apply nitrogen or anybody else\u2019s [process], \nthey do the best they can but, if it doesn\u2019t get utilized by the \nplant, you can\u2019t control that because Mother Nature always \nholds the trump card. And we can only do the best we can \nand if she decides she wants to do something different, \nwe\u2019re [out of luck].\u201d \nA number of literatures find that farmers who manage \nfor both profitability and minimization of environmental \nimpacts, and put long-term conservation in place \nbecause of concern for the ecological health of their \nwatershed, also are likely to be concerned about N runoff \nfrom their fields and farm (McGuire et al. 2013, 2015). \nProject scientists\u2019 analysis of farmer survey data found \nsimilar evidence.\nFinding: Farmers who have stronger conservationist \nidentities are more likely to put in place adaptive \nmanagement strategies for long term protection \nagainst soil erosion and excess N losses from high \nprecipitation events and runoff. \nImplications: Use of a suite of conservation \nmanagement practices can help prevent soil erosion \nand reduce loss of excess N. Farmers who value soil \nand water resources, are concerned about the long-\nterm implications of their farming practices, and \nconsider these values as central to their farmer identity, \nare implementing a variety of conservation practices.\nCover crops are conservation practices known to \nscavenge N and improve water quality. Adoption of cover \ncrops in 2011, when social scientists surveyed farmers \nacross the Upper Midwest, was at about 27% of farmers \n(see Table 1) and they had planted cover crops on 40% or \nless of their cropland. Although project field experiments \nwere focused on the use of cereal rye as a cover crop, \nfarmers are trying many types and combinations of cover \ncrops with differing experiences. Subsequent in-person \ninterviews with farmers in the region identified personal \nand structural barriers to incorporating cover crops into \ncorn-soybean rotations. In some interviews, farmers \nusing cover crops expressed disillusionment with cover \ncrops and their capacity to be scaled up across the region \n(Roesch-McNally et al. in press). \nFinding: Many farmers believe cover crop use \nentails risks from establishment and termination to \ntimely field work and to yield. Farmers who report \nhigher levels of perceived risks are less likely to \nreport cover crop use; however, farmers who report \ngreater understanding of cover crops report lower \nlevels of perceived risk (Arbuckle and Roesch-\nMcNally, 2015).\nInterviewed project farmers offer their perspectives on \ncover crops:\n\u201cYeah, I have [considered cover crops]. I think the concept is intriguing and interesting and I\u2019m just not sure \nhow would I... implement a cover crop.\u201d South Dakota farmer\n\u201cNo [haven\u2019t used cover crops] considering it though.... we\u2019re looking at seeing the positives and negatives of it. We \nhave several around us here that are using cover crops.... I \njust need to talk to some more producers. We\u2019re probably \ngoing to,\u2026 within a year or two of taking a look at it\u2026 Of \ncourse, it does improve the soil tilth\u2026 but we\u2019d like to see \na cover crop that, maybe, can add some nitrogen at a... \nmore reasonable expense than what the cost of anhydrous \nammonia is. You know, if we can do that, I\u2019d be really \ninterested in that.\u201d Illinois farmer\n\u201c\u2026 Cover crops definitely, I think, hold a lot of promise but I think there\u2019s going to be a learning curve there, \ndefinitely, that you\u2019re going to look to your neighbor or \nwhoever to say, hey, he\u2019s out killing off his oats or whatever, \nmaybe I\u2019d better get after it and get that done too.\u201d Another Illinois farmer\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m not saying I wouldn\u2019t do it again, it\u2019s just that it\u2019s... hard getting it established [be] cause, a lot of times, \nwe don\u2019t like to work our bean ground in the fall\u2026. But it \nseems like you would have to get it established so I\u2019m not \nsure how much I\u2019m going to gain if I open up that ground \nin the fall of the year and try to get this thing established \nor, leave the ground undisturbed and not establish \nanything... It\u2019s something... I\u2019ve argued it in my mind but I \nhaven\u2019t come up with a good answer yet.\u201dWisconsin farmer\nRecommendation to researchers: Increase research \nto quantify potential risks with cover crops and \ndevelop risk management practices.\nRecommendation to extension and crop advisors: \nFocus more outreach on helping farmers to better \nunderstand risks and how to manage them. A better \nunderstanding of risks and the effectiveness of risk \nmanagement strategies would help farmers to more \neffectively weigh costs and benefits of cover crops.\n2.5.5. Nitrogen management is a production \nefficiency concern with huge implications for water \nquality and farm profitability. Current management practices \nare inadequate to address the unacceptable N, sediment, \nand phosphorus losses into near-by streams and lakes \n(Alexander et al. 2008; Ribaudo 2011). These high sediment \nand phosphorus loads are exacerbated by an increasingly \nvariable climate and more frequent and extreme (4-inch or \n10-cm) rain events in short periods of time. \nRecommendations to farmers: Improve management \nof N to increase plant productivity, economic \nefficiencies, and reduce N loss that contributes to \nhypoxia conditions in the Gulf of Mexico.\nRecommendations to extension and crop advisors: \nProvide farmers and landowners with nutrient \nreduction strategies (in field, edge of field, farm, \nand watershed scale practices) that can reduce \noff-farm N loss and watershed level accumulations \nthat increase nitrate levels in downstream waters. \nEngage in an active dialogue about water quality \nissues associated with changes in the water cycle \ninfluenced by climate variability.\n2.6 CARBON SYSTEM\nSoil carbon, comprising ~1-6% of the total soil mass, \nplays a key role in the global carbon cycle. Most of the \nsoil carbon resides within soil organic matter (SOM) \nand is stored in the upper 3 feet (1 m) of the soil profile \nClimate & Managing Corn-Soybean Agroecosystems s 26\n27\n(Kravchenko 2012). SOM, an essential component \nof healthy fertile soil, is made up of previously living \nplant and animal residues that are in different stages of \ndecomposition (Lal 2014). It is a reservoir for nutrients \nnecessary for plant growth and development such as N, \nP, sulfur (S) and micronutrients. Microorganisms feed \non SOC and decompose SOM at different rates ranging \nfrom fast (several years), slow (decades to centuries), and \npassive (thousands of years) (Kravchenko 2012). Water, \nair, and temperature conditions influence the rate of \nmicrobe decomposition of SOM.\nSOM is one of the major binding agents of soil \naggregation (Lal 2015a). It holds particles together and \ncreates soil pores within and between aggregates to \nprovide air and moisture to the roots and drain excess \nwater. Carbon within the upper soil profile is more \naffected by changes in management practices than \ndeeper in the root zone. While tillage has been a staple  \nin many agricultural systems, scientists know soil \naggregate formation is disrupted when carbon is released \nfrom tillage operations (Lal 2015b). Soil disturbance \nincreases the availability of carbon to microorganisms \nand speeds the rate of decomposition and release of \ncarbon into the atmosphere as CO2 under aerobic \nconditions and CH4 under anaerobic environments. \nTillage also increases the propensity for erosion and \nother types of soil degradation. \nThe elimination of tillage results in the seed placed \ndirectly into an undisturbed soil with a goal of 100% soil \ncover, although this is difficult and not possible for all \nsoil and crop systems (Dick 2012; Lal 2015b). No-till can \npreserve complexity and heterogeneity of soil structure, \nreduce loss of SOC, improve water infiltration and \nstorage in the soil, limit soil erosion and enhance soil \nhealth (Lal 2014). Use of cover crops has the potential \nwithin certain environments to increase soil aggregation, \nretain SOC, reduce soil erosion, and improve water \ninfiltration and soil biological activity (Kladivko 2012). \nFor researchers to detect a change in SOC varies by soil \ntype and experimental design (Necpalova et al. 2013) \ndue to site variability and the slow, small changes in \nSOC. Scientists within this project measured SOC at \nthree periods capturing baseline, midpoint, and at the \nend; these results will be included in Volume 2. The \ndesign of our sampling protocol and experiments were \nfocused towards constructing a long-term footprint that \nrequires more than 5 years of funding. Implementation \nof these management practices on the landscape and \ntheir ability to sequester SOC take an uncertain length of \ntime to see an appreciable increase. \n2.6.1 Regional variation in soil organic \ncarbon. Losses and gains in SOC, soil NO3, and soil \nwater holding capacity are site specific. These changes \nreflect soil characteristics, position on the landscape, \nand tillage practices. For example, SOC in the root \nzone (0-8 inches or 0-20 cm) is eroded over time on \nslopes and summits, causing crop yields to decrease in \nthose locations. The Sustainable Corn CAP research \nexperiments have significantly different amounts of SOC \nas seen in Figure 8; this needs to be considered when \nunderstanding the rate of change and sequestration \ncapacity of soils in the Upper Midwest.\nBased on preliminary analysis of the data and in \ncongruence with existing literature, project \nrecommendations to protect and increase SOC and  \nlimit carbon loss from climate change include:\nFinding: Some soil types and experiments could \nrequire more than 20 years to show a measurable \nchange (Necpalova et al. 2013), which is important \nin funding programs and policies focused on \nimprovement of SOC.\nFinding: Cover crops can be added to increase \norganic matter inputs and aid in protection of SOC. \nPhillip Owens, Purdue Univ., examines soil samples\nClimate & Managing Corn-Soybean Agroecosystems s 28\nRecommendation to farmers: Grow cover crops \nwith a management goal of obtaining higher biomass, \nthereby increasing SOC, when and where possible.\nRecommendations to extension and crop advisors: \nContinue to document and raise awareness of \nbenefits of cover crops and NT, and how to manage \nthem for different benefits.\nRecommendations to farmers and crop advisors: \nLearn about conservation management strategies \nthat can increase soil organic matter and control \nerosion, especially in sensitive fields with highly \nerodible land. In general, best management practices \nthat create a positive carbon budget (input > losses) \nwill enhance SOC.\nAdditional project data and analyses of SOC and tillage \nare reported in Volume 2, published in 2017.\n2.6.2 Upper Midwest farmers\u2019 views on \nthe value of soil and carbon. The project\u2019s \n2012 random sample survey of farmers found that, on \naverage, 38% of farmers believed profitable markets for \ncarbon credits should be developed to encourage use of \nconservation tillage, cover crops and other practices (Loy \net al. 2013). This is a solid one-third of farmers with a \nvery narrow range of variability in the region; from 30% \nin the Des Moines HUC 6 to 44% in Black Root HUC 6. \nOver 60% of farmers were using no-till on some portion \nof their cultivated system with 43% implementing it on \nover 41% of their land (Morton et al. 2015). However it \nis observed that the use of no-till is not continuous from \none year to another and is mostly a rotational no-till, \nwhich is not as effective from an ecological standpoint. \nMany farmers realize that conservation practices must be \nin place for many years for an increase in SOC to occur. \nAn Iowa farmer observes:\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re working with the soil, it\u2019s not like a light switch. You can\u2019t just change things and see immediate \nresults. The soil needs time to transition. The conversion \ntime of three or more years (to no-till) can pose difficult \ntradeoffs for farmers.\u201d \nFinding: More than one-quarter of farmers reported \nexperiencing significant soil erosion on at least some \nof their land over the five years prior to the survey \n(2007-2011). Almost 38% expressed concern about \nincreased soil erosion on their farm. \nFinding: Farmers who reported higher proportions of \ntheir farmland as being HEL and planted to crops also \ntended to have higher proportions of land in no-till \nand cover crops (Morton et al. 2015). \nFIGURE 8  |  Soil organic carbon in the root zone (0-8 inches or  \n0-20 cm) across research sites in the region. \nFinding: 19 of 22 HUC 6 watersheds experience more \nextreme precipitation events (exceeding the 99th \npercentile) between 2007-2011 than would be expected \nby chance compared to the historical record.\nImplications for farmers: Planting crops on HEL \nunder increasing extreme precipitation events of 4 \ninches (10 cm) or higher rainfall may increase the \nvulnerability of the soil resource and the likelihood of \nhigh levels of erosion and gully formation.\nRecommendation to policymakers: Put policies in \nplace that incentivizes not planting crops on HEL. \nPlanting crops on HEL, under increasing number of \nextreme rain events, is an increasingly risky practice \nthat is likely to escalate erosion and reduce SOC.\nFinding: Many farmers believe cover crops \nhave numerous agronomic (e.g., soil health) and \nenvironmental (e.g., water quality) benefits. Farmers \nwho rate benefits more highly are more likely to \nreport cover crop use.\nFinding: Farmers believe structural barriers such as \nlack of market infrastructure (e.g., seed, equipment, \nand technical assistance), compatible regulatory/\npolicy frameworks (e.g. crop insurance), and \nconventional thinking among landlords and crop \nadvisors are impediments to cover crop adoption.\nImplications: Farmers\u2019 perceptions about cover crop \nimplementation and the balance of risks and benefits \nare influencing their decisions to try them.\nRecommendations for policymakers: Continue to \nwork toward improved facilitating infrastructure. \nOutreach to agricultural advisors (e.g., agricultural \nretailers, custom operators) will help them become \nmore comfortable with cover crops, or to view them \nas a business opportunity.\nRecommendations for policymakers: Develop \noutreach strategies for non-operator landowners; for \nexample, educational materials that target them with \nmessages about the potential short and long-term \nbenefits of cover crops.\n29\nSECTION 3. Conclusion\nManagement practices employed in corn-based cropping \nsystems and utilized to build adaptive capacity to climate \nchange allow significant gains in production, resilience, \nand sustainability overall. Analyses and modeling \nof project field experimental data offer new findings \nand add detail to prior literatures related to managing \nwater, nitrogen, and carbon in Upper Midwest corn-\nbased cropping systems under increasingly variable \nclimate and extreme precipitation events. This team has \nsubstantially advanced agro-climate science and increased \nunderstanding of the barriers to action from the field \nto the watershed level. This information can be used to \ndevelop regional policies that more effectively influence \nadoption of diverse conservation practices and equip \nfarmers for climate change.\nProject biophysical scientists have identified basic \nprocesses that enhance soil health, conserve nutrients \nand sustain productivity. Strategies are directed towards \nretention of SOC to improve soil health, reduce the loss \nof soil N and other nutrients to enhance use efficiency \nof resources, improve system resilience to sustain \nproductivity, and strengthen communication with land \nmanagers to develop an effective action plan. These \nstrategies can be mutually obtained by adopting a suite \nof practices proven to be successful across much of \nthe Upper Midwest, followed by local adoption by the \nfarmer based on farm-level agronomic and ecological \ngoals. \nThe interconnectedness among carbon, nitrogen, water, \nand crop productivity necessitates a system mindset \nwith the benefit of ripple effects occurring across many \nfacets of the agroecosystem when improvements are \nmade. Findings, implications, and recommendations \nhighlighted in this report include cover crops to build \nSOC, no-till to conserve soil and water and enhance \nSOC, and controlled drainage to conserve nutrients and \nleverage water resources. \nWidespread adoption of these strategies by transfer \nof knowledge through science-driven learning \nopportunities and educational programs is necessary to \nlessen the impact from climate change on agricultural \nsystems in the Upper Midwest. This transdisciplinary \nteam has determined that improving the system as a \nwhole, with a focus on the soil, is critical to developing \nclimate-resilient corn-based systems.\nProject social scientists found that Midwest farmers have \nhighly heterogeneous perspectives about climate change \nClimate & Managing Corn-Soybean Agroecosystems s 30\nJane Frankenberger, Purdue Univ., leads a field \ndemonstration during the project\u2019s 2013 annual meeting, \nin Indiana\nand associated risks (Arbuckle et al. 2014). Many farmers \nseem to use their experiences with past weather as a \nbaseline to make sense of current weather and projected \nweather in order to make good management decisions. \nProject models examining factors that influence \ndecisions to implement no-till, cover crops, and to plant \nmore crops on highly erodible land find that actual past \nclimate and precipitation can have a significant effect on \nthe type of management put in place. Further, responses \nare local, since seasonal precipitation varies greatly \nacross the Upper Midwest and has a differential impact \non the type of management used (Morton et al. 2015). \nUncertainty, perceptions of vulnerability, and access to \nresources such as crop insurance and other programs \ncan affect capacities (and willingness) to respond to \nperceived risks and hazards (Loy et al. 2013; Morton \net al. In review). Farmer adaptations are responses to \nperceptions and interpretations of information and \nexperiences; these do not always reflect best management \npractices scientists have found to be most effective. \nThe effectiveness of adaptive responses to a changing \nclimate in corn-based systems depends on the degree to \nwhich the region\u2019s farmers are willing and able to link \nknown science with their own local knowledge-based \nexperiences. Farmers, crop advisors, climatologists and \ntechnical specialists are the stakeholders who are the \nultimate integrators of agricultural science within and \nacross the agroecosystem (Prokopy et al. 2013; Wilke \nand Morton 2015a, 2015b). These stakeholders combine \nand weigh science with their own knowledge and \nexperiences to make land use and management decisions \nthat influence production and environmental outcomes \nat field, farm, and watershed levels. Prior literatures and \nfindings from this project suggest that underlying beliefs \nand values, attitudes, social norms and relationships \nare situationally activated in farmers\u2019 assessments \nof risks and opportunities (Slovic 2009; Prokopy et \nal. 2015a; Prokopy et al. 2015b; Arbuckle et al. 2015; \nMorton et al. 2015). Social scientists are just beginning \nto understand how these factors are incorporated into \na farmer\u2019s decision to adapt (or not), and how they \naffect willingness and capacities to respond to increased \nvariability in weather and climate.\nThe Sustainable Corn team has developed an extensive \ncross-disciplinary network of colleagues and research to \nbetter understand current and future capacity of Upper \nMidwest corn-based agroecosystems for resilience \nto climate change. This complex challenge spans \nbiophysical, social, and economic aspects necessitating \nintegrated research questions that drive solutions that \ncan be implemented on a local and regional basis. \nScientists and stakeholders now have a greater set of \nresources grounded in scientific research to evaluate \nmanagement systems and the dynamic potential to \nreduce uncertainty and risk under an increasingly \nvariable climate. \nThe findings and recommendations in this report \nrepresent project research intended to increase \nunderstanding of the distribution and timing \nof precipitation and temperature, management practices, \nand human perceptions of risk and vulnerability of \n31\nLaura Bowling, Purdue Univ., leads a field demonstration in Indiana\ncorn-based agroecosystems. This science is critical if \nagriculture is to continue to innovate, adapt and thrive \nunder changing conditions. The research findings and \nwork with stakeholders reinforce one overarching \nconclusion: local adaptation of corn-based cropping \nsystems to climate extreme will require farmers  \nto experiment with practices, and customize a  \nsuite of practices that work for their landscape and \nlocal climate.\nThe Sustainable Corn CAP team acknowledges that \npeople learn and change behaviors in different ways \nand at different rates. Human adaptations to a changing \nclimate will not be linear nor always seem rational. A \nvariety of strategies are needed to increase continuous \naccess to science and its changing parameters, and to \nensure interpretations that are meaningful and of value \nto farmers, agricultural policymakers, and society at \nlarge. The transfer of scientific knowledge and the \nreconstruction of new knowledge when scientific and \nstakeholder knowledge are integrated is a dynamic and \never-changing process. Findings in this report have \nimplications for Extension and outreach efforts as well \nas education of science teachers and next generation \nscientists. Volume 3 of this Technical Report series, \nClimate Change and Agricultural Extension, co-produced \nin partnership with the USDA-NIFA Useful to Usable \n(U2U) project, addresses the challenges and provides \nguidance for communicating climate science and \napplying it to managing agricultural systems. Volume 4, \nAgri-Climate Education; Preparing the Next Generation, \ndocuments hands-on learning field days and modules \nthat help teachers communicate these principles in the \nclassroom. \nThe Sustainable Corn CAP has expanded knowledge \nabout C, N, water, and human-social systems that \nunderpin corn-soybean systems and their interactive \nresponses to variability and extreme weather events. \nWhile funding for this project has ended, the work \ncontinues. Many of the Sustainable Corn CAP scientists \ncontinue this work in a variety of ways. Project next \ngeneration scientists, the graduate students and post-\ndoctoral associates who were trained in their discipline \nas part of this project, will use what we have learned \nto build new science as they move into their future \ncareers. These next generation scientists worked side-\nby-side with more experienced scientists within and \noutside their discipline to bring together disciplinary \ntheories, methodologies, and known science with other \ndisciplinary sciences to create new knowledge that better \nrepresents the dynamic and complex nature of the corn-\nbased agroecosystem. \nThe Sustainable Corn team continues to evaluate \nsystem scale research outcomes of in-field management \npractices to determine how farmers can develop systems \nthat meet crop productivity and environment goals \nunder changing conditions.\nGroup discussion during the project\u2019s 2012 annual meeting.  \nFrom left: Reagan Waskom, Colorado Water Institute; Dennis Todey, South Dakota State \nUniv.; and Robert Anex, Univ. of Wisconsin.\nSECTION 4.

By supporting research, education, and Cooperative Extension \nprograms at land-grant universities and other partner organizations, NIFA moves \nscience from labs to farms and classrooms, to the dining table, and back again.\nNIFA provides program leadership and more than $1 billion of congressionally-\nappropriated funding each year. NIFA\u2019s mission, vision, goals, and initiatives are \nlinked to the strategic goals and priorities of USDA and the Research, Education,  \nand Economics (REE) Action Plan. The resulting scientific progress enhances the  \ncompetitiveness of American agriculture, bolsters the U.S. economy, enhances  \nthe safety of the nation\u2019s food supply, improves the nutrition and well-being of \nAmerican citizens, and sustains the nation\u2019s environment and natural resources. \nNIFA grants also help institutions address shortfalls in curricula design, material  \ndevelopment, faculty enhancement, instruction delivery systems, student  \nexperiential learning opportunities, scientific instrumentation for teaching,  \nand student recruitment and retention. \nThe following projects highlight how NIFA-funding contributes to significant \nachievements in food, agricultural, natural resources, and human sciences.\nnifa 2014 impacts report local and global food supply  and security\nblueberries pass peaches in georgia \nUniversity of Georgia horticulturists have \ndeveloped several varieties of blueberries that \nare specialized as early- and late-season \ncrops, as well as larger berries at a higher \nyield. As a result, Georgia peaches have taken \na backseat as blueberry production has \nincreased from 3,500 acres to more than \n20,000 acres in recent years. With annual \nfarm gate values approaching $254 million, \nthe blueberry has become Georgia\u2019s number \none fruit crop. In addition to improving yield, \nthis research project included additional \nmechanical harvesting, reducing commercial \nproduction time to 3 years or less, and devel-\noping sound harvest management practices.\u2022 \nheating up lettuce production\nLettuce contains a gene that halts seed  \ngermination if it gets too hot, and that could \nbe trouble in California and Arizona\u2014two \nstates that produce more than 90 percent  \nof the lettuce grown in the United States. \nResearchers at the University of California-\nDavis discovered a chromosome in wild \nPeruvian lettuce that allows for germination  \nat higher temperatures and transferred that \ngene into commercial lettuce. The result is less \nwater used to cool the soil, a longer growing \nseason, and a reduced need for shipping\u2014 \na combination that means more water for \nother uses, more money for farmers, more \nfresh lettuce for consumers, and reduced \ngreenhouse gas emissions. \u2022 \ngenetics may improve how  \ncattle process nutrients\nAnimal science researchers at the University \nof Missouri are working to improve feed \nefficiency in beef cattle. Investigators have \nlocated the chromosomal regions responsible \nfor growth performance that help cattle get \nthe most out of what they eat. Armed with  \nthis knowledge, cattle producers will be able  \nto build their herds by selecting and breeding \nstock that best possess this trait. These  \n\u201cfeed conversion\u201d genes are located on \ndifferent chromosomes in different breeds,  \nso herd improvement selection criteria will \nvary by breed. By increasing the nutritional \nefficiency of their herds, cattle producers  \nwill see higher profits by reducing the amount \nof feed it takes to raise cattle. This will also \nreduce the environmental footprint of beef \nproduction by reducing amount of manure  \nand greenhouse gases.\u2022\nresponding to climate  \nand energy needs\nresearch team works to sustain  \ncorn through weather extremes\nAmerican corn production covers about 95 \nmillion acres on 400,000 farms and brought \nin about $65 billion in 2013.

Iowa State University is leading a \nwide range of researchers from 10 land-grant \nuniversities and USDA\u2019s Agricultural Research \nService in a Sustainable Corn Project to \nmitigate and adapt the Midwest \u201cCorn Belt\u201d  \nto climate change. Since the project began  \nin 2011, researchers have created a central \ndatabase to better evaluate how drainage, \ncover crops, tillage, fertilizers, and crop \nrotations affect water, carbon, and nitrogen \ncycles under variable weather conditions.  \nIn addition, the team is training 159 students\u2014\nundergraduate through post-doctoral\u2014 \nto become the next generation of scientists \nwho can help increase future food production \nand ensure the integrity and resilience of \nnatural resources.\u2022\ngreen energy alternatives:  \nfrom stable waste to power source\nMorrisville (NY) State College has put  \nthe spurs to turning waste into sources  \nof renewable energy. Researchers at  \nMorrisville\u2019s Renewable Energy Training \nCenter have discovered a way to convert  \nhorse manure and bedding into briquettes  \nand then use those briquettes as fuel to heat \ntwo of the school\u2019s residence halls. Producing \nthese briquettes is only a portion of the \nmulti-million dollar grant, which funds the \nstudy of renewable energy sources, including \nsolar and wind systems. The availability  \nof horse manure and bedding material at \nMorrisville creates a \u201cgreen\u201d solution to the \nrising cost of fuel production, saves money  \nthe school used to spend in disposal costs, \nand gives students a living laboratory to \naccompany classes in renewable energy  \nand sustainability.\u2022\nsustainable use of natural resources\ncover crops save irrigation  \nwater and expense\nUniversity of Nebraska researchers have \ndemonstrated that reduced tillage or no-till \nfarming can save on irrigation. The researchers \ndetermined that farm plots with cover crops  \nor crop residue saved on irrigation water by as \nmuch as 60 to 110 millimeters per year, which \nsaved farmers thousands of dollars per year  \non a 130-acre field. In these days of prolonged \ndrought and severe wildfires across much  \nof the United States, the practice of cover \ncropping and reduced-till agriculture can save \nfarmers money in reduced pumping costs and \nleaves more water available for other uses.\u2022\nnutrition and childhood obesity\ninventing healthier fats\nProsperity Organic Foods, Boise, ID, used a \nNIFA-administered Small Business Innovation \nResearch (SBIR) grant to develop an organic, \nhealthy baking/cooking fat that raises energy \nexpenditure to assist with healthy, sustainable \nweight management. The organic baking/\ncooking fat was derived from an organic \nbuttery spread that is already in distribution  \nin North America. The organic baking/cooking \nfat will be the first product line of its kind \nlaunched into the existing butter and marga-\nrine category to compete directly with non-\nspread forms of butter and shortening. The \ncompany has been awarded an SBIR Phase II \ngrant, which allows them to conduct further \nresearch and development and prepare for \nproduct commercialization.\u2022\nimproving the quality of soy flavor\nUniversity of Kentucky researchers took  \non the task of sniffing out and removing the \nsource of the unpleasant odors produced \nduring soy protein manufacturing. They knew \nthat if they found a way to remove the sulfur- \ncontaining odorants they could improve the \nflavor of soy-based products and promote \nconsumer demand. The team discovered  \nthat the addition of an approved food additive \ncalled potassium iodate during the manufac-\nturing process stopped a chemical reaction \nwithin the soybeans and practically eliminated \nthe foul odor. The technology of this process, \nwhich has been patented and is undergoing \ntrials in a large U.S. soy processing plant,  \nis an example of how basic research funded  \nby a NIFA competitive grants program has \nbeen transferred to private industry.\u2022\ncamden grows: a community  \nfood projects success story\nThe Community Food Projects Competitive \nGrant Program provides funds to low-income \ncommunity, non-profit organizations that \ndevelop projects to combat food insecurity, \nthe state of having limited access to adequate \nfood. These projects help communities  \nprovide for their own food needs and create \nnew marketing opportunities that help  \nboth agricultural producers and low-income \nconsumers. One such project, \u201cCamden \nGrows,\u201d produces and distributes fresh \nproduce to the residents of Camden, NJ\u2014 \ndocumented as the poorest city of its size in \nAmerica.

Allergies to peanuts are \namong the most severe of all food allergies, \naffecting some 2.8 million people in the United \nStates, including 400,000 school-aged \nchildren. Now, however, there is good news \nfrom the North Carolina Agricultural and \nTechnical State University (NC A&T) where \nscientists have discovered a way to remove  \nup to 98 percent of the allergens. Researchers \nfound that by soaking roasted peanuts that \nhave been shelled and skinned in a solution \ncontaining food-grade enzymes, they can \nvirtually reduce or eliminate two key allergens. \nThe process does not affect flavor, and treated \npeanuts can be eaten whole, in pieces, or as \nflour in various products. The process has \nbeen validated at the University of North \nCarolina at Chapel Hill through human clinical \ntrials using skin prick tests. NC A&T officials \nexpect hypoallergenic peanut products to hit \nstore shelves soon.\u2022\nnovel pasteurization system  \nhelps keep food safe\nA new microwave system developed by \nNIFA-funded researchers at Washington State \nUniversity is now available to food companies \nto help reduce the chances of contamination \nin chilled or frozen meals. The microwave-\nassisted pasteurization system processes 8-  \nto 20-ounce pre-packaged chilled meals. Shelf \nlife exceeding 1 month at refrigeration tem-\nperatures are possible. The potential applica-\ntions of this technology extends to controlling \npathogens on fresh and minimally processed \nfruits and vegetables using lower temperature \npasteurization and sophisticated packaging.\u2022\nmiddle school students get  \n\u201chands on\u201d food safety education\nUniversity of Tennessee educators have \ndeveloped a food safety education curriculum \nfor middle school students entitled \u201cHands \nOn: Real World Lessons for Middle School \nClassrooms.\u201d Hands On is a free, interactive, \nresearch-based program that integrates \nscience, social studies, math, language arts, \nand vocabulary that teaches students key food \nsafety concepts and practices. Foodborne \nillnesses cause an average of 5,000 deaths per \nyear and costing up to $37 billion per year in \nhealth care costs. Since adolescents frequently \nprepare after-school snacks, and even meals,  \nit is important for them to receive this training. \nAs of March 2013, Hands On has reached \nmore than 34,000 students at 148 middle \nschools in 11 states.\u2022\neducation and science literacy\ngrowing numbers of female  \nfarm operators make timing  \nright for annie\u2019s project\nAnnie\u2019s Project, an education program that  \nis dedicated to empowering women in  \nagriculture, develops the networks and skills \nwomen need to form successful partnerships. \nAcross America, Annie\u2019s Project courses \nprovide women in agriculture with answers, \nbusiness skills, friendship,and confidence.  \nThe number of women owning farm business-\nes or becoming more involved in farm  \ndecision-making is growing nationally.  \nFor example, in New York\u2019s Chautaugua \nCounty, 228 women, or 16 percent, are \nprimary farm operators according to the 2007 \nCensus of Agriculture. Women farm owners/\noperators are on the rise, with a 3 percent \nincrease from 2002 to 2007 in Chautauqua \nCounty. These women don\u2019t have to go it \nalone, as Cornell Cooperative Extension \nfacilitates Annie\u2019s Project in New York and \noffers a 6-week program in risk management, \nfarm business planning, marketing, and \nmore.\u2022\nhelping afghans strengthen  \ntheir extension capacity\nWith NIFA-administered funding and  \ncollaboration from USDA\u2019s Foreign Agricul-\ntural Service, the University of California-\nDavis is leading a consortium of American \nuniversities (Purdue, Washington State,  \nand University of Maryland) that is helping  \nto strengthen the extension education system \nin Afghanistan. The Afghanistan Agricultural \nExtension Project (AAEP) initiated provincial \nmodel teaching farms,  farmer field schools \nand on-farm demonstrations\u2014now main-\ntained and supervised by Afghan extension \neducators\u2014to cover such topics as women  \nin agriculture, greenhouse production,  \nconservation agriculture, and improved grain \nstorage methods to reduce postharvest loss. \nAAEP has trained nearly 8,000 extension \neducators, agricultural faculty, students and \nfarmers and established more than 600 \nfarmer field schools in 19 Afghan provinces \nsince 2012. \u2022\nrural prosperity/ \nrural-urban interdependence\nteaching the next generation of \namerica\u2019s farmers and ranchers\nA team from the University of Arkansas used \nfunding from NIFA\u2019s Beginning Farmer and \nRancher Development Program to develop \nonline educational modules and in-person \ntraining and mentoring to underserved groups. \niS\nto\nck\n p\nho\nto\ncontinued next page >>\nU\nSD\nA\n p\nho\nto\niS\nto\nck\n p\nho\nto\niS\nto\nck\n p\nho\nto\nUSDA is an equal opportunity provider and employer  |  June 2014\ninvesting in science | securing our future | www.nifa.usda.gov\nProject educators teach poultry, livestock,  \nand agroforestry production to military \nveterans, Spanish-speaking individuals, \nwomen in agriculture, African-Americans,  \nand economically and educationally  \ndisadvantaged groups.

A reasonable amount of \ntime must be given to primary owners of data to publish in their respective journals. It is expected \nsecondary users of the data will know their journal\u2019s stipulations regarding the disclosure of the dataset \nat time of publishing. This is an important clarification so that any published work on modeling does not \nunknowingly disqualify future publications of the dataset from occurring.  \n \nIt is the role of the data owner to assure the data is of highest quality with no known errors or changes \nexpected to occur once it is uploaded to the team database. Secondary users may access and initially \nwork with data contained in the database but must obtain PI agreement prior to publication.  \n \nWe affirm that it is highly desirable the owners of data be given an opportunity to review and comment on \nall publications that utilize their data. The primary data owners will improve the quality of analyses and \nthe papers that describe them by providing insights into the quality and meaning of the data, the nature \nof the physical systems that they represent, and proper and correct use of the data. \n \nToward this end, data owners should be given a period of at least twenty-one (21) days to review and \ncomment on publications that utilize their data prior to journal submission. In some circumstances this \nmay not be possible, such as use of data in special submissions that have a firm deadline, but such \ncircumstances should be rare exceptions.  Ordinary journal submissions should be made only after \nreview by the data owners and a discussion between the analysts and data owners of any comments \nresulting from the review. Owners of primary data are not, however, invested with the power to veto or \ndelay a submission through inaction. It is expected that all members of the team will work together in a \ncollaborative and supportive way, resulting in a large number of publications of superior quality. \n \nAuthorship of primary data owners should be as outlined in Category 1, point 3 (page 2); in which data \nowners should be listed alphabetically following authors of the paper. Authors using datasets benefitting \nfrom compilation, visualization, interpretation, analysis, or synthesis performed by the data team should \nconsider including data team members as authors as appropriate.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7 \n \nI have discussed this publication with all involved data owners and have followed the guidelines as stated in \nthis document for my specific type of publication.   \n \nTitle of Publication: ________________________________________________________ \n \nPublisher: _______________________________________________________________ \n \nLead Author of Publication: ______________________________   Date _____________ \n \n \nI agree to use of the data, which was collected by myself and/or my team, for use in the lead author\u2019s \npublication.
