It has 2 \nimportant implications for atmospheric chemistry, climate regulation, and 3 \nsulfur transport from the marine to the atmospheric and terrestrial 4 \nenvironment. In addition, DMS acts as an info-chemical for a wide range of 5 \norganisms ranging from microorganisms to mammals. Microorganisms that 6 \ncycle DMS are widely distributed in a range of environments, for instance oxic 7 \nand anoxic marine, freshwater and terrestrial habitats. Despite the importance 8 \nof DMS that has been unearthed by many studies since the early 1970s, the 9 \nunderstanding of the biochemistry, genetics and ecology of DMS-degrading 10 \nmicroorganisms is still limited. This review examines current knowledge on the 11 \nmicrobial cycling of DMS and points out areas for future research that should 12 \nshed more light on the role of organisms degrading DMS and related 13 \ncompounds in the biosphere. 14 \n 15 \nDMS and related organic sulfur compounds 16 \nVolatile sulfur compounds play an important role within the biogeochemical cycle of 17 \nsulfur. In being able to transfer from the liquid into the gas phase and vice versa, 18 \nreduced volatile sulfur compounds have particular importance for affecting the 19 \ncomposition and chemistry of the atmosphere. Although carbonyl sulfide (COS) has 20 \nthe highest concentration of the reduced volatile sulfur compounds in the atmosphere, 21 \ndimethylsulfide (DMS) has the highest source strength (Watts 2000) and is thought of 22 \nas a climate cooling gas (Charlson et al. 1987). DMS is produced by a variety of 23 \nchemical and biological processes, both natural and man-made, and it is itself subject 24 \nto a wide variety of chemical and biological transformations in the environment. 25 \nSome aspects of the microbial metabolism of the related compounds (see Table 1) 26 \n 3\ndimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), dimethylsulfone 27 \n(DMSO2),  methanethiol (MT) and methanesulfonic acid (MSA) are also considered 28 \nwhere appropriate as these occur as precursors and/or degradation products of DMS. 29 \n 30 \nIndustrial roles of DMS and related compounds.  31 \nFrom an anthropocentric point of view, DMS and the related compounds DMSO and 32 \nDMSO2 are of particular interest in terms of their roles as flavour compounds and 33 \ntheir industrial applications. DMS is a colourless liquid with a boiling point of 41\u00b0C. 34 \nand has a disagreeable odour akin to that of rotting cabbage. In our daily lives it is 35 \noften present at low concentrations as an important flavour compound in a wide range 36 \nof foods, including raw and processed fruits and vegetables such as tomatoes, 37 \nsweetcorn, grapes, asparagus and brassicas (Bills and Keenan 1968; Buttery et al. 38 \n2002; Kubec et al. 1998; Miers 1966; Segurel et al. 2004; Ulrich et al. 2001; Wong 39 \nand Carson 1966), cheeses (McGugan 2002; Milo and Reineccius 1997) honey (de la 40 \nFuente et al. 2007), and truffles (Talou et al. 1987), for instance. DMS is equally 41 \nimportant as a flavour compound in a variety of beverages including beers (Meilgaard 42 \n2002), wines (e.g. Segurel et al. 2004), orange and grapefruit juice (Shaw et al. 1980), 43 \nand is also found in roast coffee (Rhoades 2002) and processed milk (Keenan and 44 \nLindsay 1968). DMS can be part of the essential aroma profile but also be of concern 45 \nas it can contribute to off-notes.  46 \nDMSO is a water-soluble polar organic solvent that is useful in a range of 47 \nindustries, and is also relevant as a pharmaceutical drug delivery agent that can 48 \nfacilitate the movement of various compounds across lipid membranes (Leake 1967). 49 \nBoth DMSO and DMSO2 are found in a wide range of foods including milk (Pearson 50 \net al. 1981). Humans excrete 4-11mg of DMSO2 per day via urine. Marketed as 51 \n 4\nmethylsulfonylmethane, it is also a constituent of some dietary supplements (see 52 \nParcell 2002 for a review). 53 \n 54 \nEnvironmental significance of DMS and related compounds 55 \nThe roles of C1-sulfur compounds in an industrial and human context described above 56 \nare eclipsed by the major functions of these compounds in the environment, which 57 \nhave stimulated a substantial body of research over the last three decades. Chemical 58 \nweathering of rock and the water solubility of sulfate lead to loss of sulfur from the 59 \ncontinents due to surface water runoff to the oceans. The oceans are rich in sulfur, 60 \nhaving a sulfate concentration of approximately 28mM. Emission of sulfur species 61 \nfrom the marine environment into the atmosphere, their atmospheric transport and 62 \nsubsequent deposition by wet and dry deposition on the continents are thus an 63 \nimportant link in the sulfur cycle, affording sulfur transport from the oceans to the 64 \ncontinents (compare Figure 1). Prior to the work by Lovelock and colleagues it was 65 \nassumed that hydrogen sulfide was the volatile sulfur compound emitted into the 66 \natmosphere that provided a precursor for sulfate aerosols in marine air (Saltzman and 67 \nCooper 1989), however Lovelock and colleagues showed that dimethylsulfide was 68 \nmuch more abundant in the marine boundary layer than hydrogen sulfide (Lovelock et 69 \nal. 1972). Based on these findings it was realised that DMS provides a route for sulfur 70 \ntransport between the oceans and the terrestrial environment (Nguyen et al. 1978). It 71 \nis now well established that DMS is the most abundant form of biogenic sulfur input 72 \ninto the atmosphere; estimates range from 19 to 50 Tg of sulfur that are emitted as 73 \nDMS from the marine environment per annum (Andreae 1990), which translates to 74 \naround 200 million tons of sulfur, or roughly to 0.66 tons of sulfur emitted per km2 of 75 \nocean surface on average.  76 \n 5\n 77 \nAtmospheric oxidation of DMS and the CLAW hypothesis  78 \nIn the atmosphere, DMS is subject to chemical and photochemical oxidation resulting 79 \nin a range of organic and inorganic sulfur species, mainly sulfate, sulfur dioxide and 80 \nmethanesulfonic acid (MSA) (Hatakeyama et al. 1982; Panter and Penzhorn 1980; 81 \nPham et al. 1995), but DMSO and DMSO2 are also formed (Harvey and Lang 1986; 82 \nZhu et al. 2003), and DMSO has been detected in rain water (Kiene and Gerard 1994; 83 \nRidgeway et al. 1992; Sciare et al. 1998). The atmospheric residence time of DMS is 84 \nshort, only about a day, and the main atmospheric sinks are believed to be the daytime 85 \noxidation with hydroxyl radicals and reaction with nitrate radicals during the night; 86 \nhowever, it appears that the reactions removing DMS and their rate constants are 87 \ncomplex and not yet well understood in detail (see Barnes et al. 2006 for a review). 88 \nAs indicated above, the atmospheric transport and subsequent dry and wet deposition 89 \nof these sulfur compounds on the continents provide an important link in the global 90 \nsulfur cycle. In soils, atmospherically derived sulfur contributes to the pool of sulfur 91 \navailable for assimilation as a plant nutrient, directly as sulfate, or indirectly after 92 \nmicrobial regeneration of sulfate from organic sulfur compounds such as MSA, 93 \nDMSO and DMSO2 (see Kertesz 2000 for a review). The atmospheric oxidation 94 \nproducts of DMS form aerosol particles which have direct and indirect effects that 95 \nlead to negative temperature forcing of the Earth-atmosphere system, directly 96 \nreflecting solar radiation and indirectly by providing particles that can act as cloud 97 \ncondensation nuclei (CCN) in the atmosphere. An increase in the number of CCN 98 \nfacilitates the formation of clouds that have a higher number of relatively smaller 99 \nwater droplets, thereby increasing the cloud albedo and decreasing the amount of solar 100 \nradiation to reach the Earth surface. Hence, atmospheric DMS has been linked to 101 \nclimate regulation and is considered as a climate-cooling gas (Charlson et al. 1987). 102 \n 6\nCharlson and colleagues hypothesised that production of DMSP by phytoplankton in 103 \nthe oceans was the basis of a geophysiological feedback loop that regulates global 104 \nclimate, also known as the CLAW hypothesis according to the first letters of the 105 \nauthors\u2019 surnames (Charlson et al. 1987). The CLAW hypothesis states that an 106 \nincrease in solar irradiation and climate warming stimulates phytoplankton growth in 107 \nthe oceans and leads to an increased production of DMSP in the surface ocean causing 108 \na greater flux of DMS into the atmosphere. The associated increase of DMS-derived 109 \naerosol particles in the atmosphere causes more solar radiation to be reflected, either 110 \ndirectly by aerosols or indirectly through intensified formation of high albedo clouds; 111 \nultimately these consequences of DMS emission are predicted to cause a cooling of 112 \nthe Earth\u2019s climate. Climate cooling and reduction of the amount of 113 \nphotosynthetically active radiation reaching the ocean surface, due to increased 114 \nalbedo, cause a decrease in phytoplankton growth and lead to a reduction of DMSP 115 \nproduction in the ocean, a concomitant decrease in DMS emission and therefore an 116 \neasing of the aforementioned negative temperature forcing; the phytoplankton 117 \nDMSP/DMS system is therefore suggested to form a negative feedback loop 118 \n(Charlson et al. 1987).  119 \nVallina and Sim\u00f3 found that marine DMS concentrations are positively 120 \ncorrelated with solar radiation dose (Vallina and Sim\u00f3 2007) which might lend 121 \nsupport to the CLAW hypothesis as an increase of solar radiation would be expected 122 \nto cause climate warming and increased DMS emission. Different approaches of 123 \nmodelling the expected increase of marine DMS production under global warming 124 \nscenarios, however, have suggested only a modest 1-2% increase in DMS production, 125 \nwhich is much weaker than observable seasonal variations of DMS (Bopp et al. 2003; 126 \nVallina et al. 2007). Nevertheless, studies have confirmed that DMS-derived aerosol 127 \n 7\ncan be a significant source of CCN especially in the remote marine atmosphere that 128 \nreceives little dust and aerosol from the continents (Ayers et al. 1991; Vallina et al. 129 \n2006), but the interactions and pathways in atmospheric DMS oxidation are complex 130 \nand not fully understood precluding quantitative modelling (Ayers et al. 1997). The 131 \nview that emissions of DMS from the marine environment have implications for 132 \nclimate and atmospheric chemistry is widely supported, but there is as yet no 133 \nunambiguous evidence for the validity of the CLAW hypothesis. 134 \n 135 \nSources of DMS  136 \nMarine environment 137 \nVarious estimates of the flux of DMS to the atmosphere have been made (range of 15-138 \n109 Tg a-1) but a review of the sources of DMS suggests to adopt a figure of 139 \napproximately 24.49 +/- 5.3 Tg a-1(Watts 2000). The strength of the marine 140 \nenvironment as a source of DMS has been estimated at around 21 Tg a-1 and is 141 \ntherefore by far the most important source totalling around 80% of the total DMS 142 \nflux, the remaining 20% originate from vegetation, salt marshes and estuaries, soils, 143 \nwetlands and also include anthropogenic sources (Watts 2000). 144 \nDimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) is the main source of DMS in the marine 145 \nenvironment. DMSP is a metabolite of certain species of macroalgae (Challenger and 146 \nSimpson 1948; Van Alstyne and Puglisi 2007) and phytoplankton, in particular in 147 \ndinoflagellates and in species such as the Haptophytes Emilinia huxleyi and 148 \nPhaeocystis (Liss et al. 1994; Malin and Kirst 1997). Algae can accumulate DMSP to 149 \nhigh internal concentrations reaching to hundreds of mM (reviewed in Stefels 2000; 150 \nYoch 2002). Corals and their zooxanthellae also contain large amounts of DMSP (Hill 151 \net al. 1995), which can be the source of high local DMS concentrations (approx 1\u00b5M) 152 \n 8\nin coral reefs, for instance in coral mucus ropes (Broadbent and Jones 2004). It has 153 \nbeen suggested that DMSP has a role as an osmolyte (Kiene et al. 2000; Stefels 2000), 154 \nan antifreeze compound (Kirst et al. 1991) or an antioxidant (Sunda et al. 2002), but 155 \nits exact role remains unresolved and it is possible that it serves distinct roles in 156 \ndifferent organisms (Otte et al. 2004). Some vascular plants also contain DMSP, for 157 \ninstance some halophytes of the genus Spartina and Wollastonia biflora contain 158 \nsignificant amounts of DMSP, and the molecule has also been detected in sugar cane 159 \n(see Otte et al. 2004 for a review).   160 \nUpon lysis of DMSP-containing organisms, for instance by viral attack (Malin 161 \net al. 1998) or zooplankton grazing (Wolfe et al. 1994; Wolfe and Steinke 1996), 162 \nDMSP becomes dissolved in seawater. Microbial degradation of dissolved DMSP 163 \noccurs through a number of different pathways (Howard et al. 2006; Johnston et al. 164 \n2008) (compare Figure 2), and the majority of DMSP is not degraded to DMS 165 \n(Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 1999; Kiene et al. 2000; Moran et al. 2003; Yoch 2002). Until 166 \nrecently, the enzyme cleaving DMSP was generally referred to as \u201cDMSP lyase\u201d, but 167 \nthe exact mechanisms by which DMS is formed from DMSP had not been 168 \ninvestigated in any detail. Using genetic analysis of bacteria that form DMS from 169 \nDMSP, Johnston and coworkers have described three different pathways of DMSP-170 \ndependent DMS formation that involve enzymes that are members of different 171 \nenzyme families (Curson et al. 2008; Johnston et al. 2008; Todd et al. 2009; Todd et 172 \nal. 2007).   173 \nDissolved DMSP and/or DMS derived from it has been shown to be a 174 \npowerful signalling molecule that attracts certain bacteria, e.g. chemotaxis by 175 \nSilicibacter TM1040 (Miller et al. 2004), but also affects the swimming (copepods, 176 \nharbour seals, coral reef fish) and flying (petrels, shearwaters) behaviour of a range of 177 \n 9\norganisms presumably as a foraging cue (see review by Johnston et al. 2008). A role 178 \nof DMS as an info-chemical is also indicated by studies demonstrating that it allowed 179 \ndogs and pigs to detect truffles in soil (Talou et al. 1990) and a study that showed the 180 \nimportance of volatile organic sulfur compounds including DMS, DMDS and 181 \ndimethyltrisulfide (DMTS) in the \u201cbouquet of death\u201d that attracted burying beetles to 182 \ncarcasses of mice (Kalinov\u00e1 et al. 2009).  183 \nThe majority of DMS emission is from open ocean environments, but microbial 184 \nmats and intertidal sediments are also important sources of DMS (Steudler and 185 \nPeterson 1984). Several studies have investigated the cycling of DMS and related 186 \ncompounds in such ecosystems (Jonkers et al. 1998; Kiene 1988; 1990; Kiene and 187 \nCapone 1988; Lymio et al. 2009; Visscher et al. 2003; Visscher et al. 1991).  DMSP-188 \nproducing plants and macroalgae, e.g. the salt marsh cord grass Spartina alterniflora 189 \nor the green algal seaweed Ulva spp., can contribute to the production of DMS in such 190 \necosystems (Kiene and Capone 1988 and references therein), however, other 191 \npathways of DMS formation may be more important in anoxic sediments, including 192 \nreduction of DMSO, metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids, and methylation of 193 \nsulfide (Jonkers et al. 1996; Kiene and Capone 1988; Lomans et al. 1997; Visscher et 194 \nal. 2003; Visscher et al. 1991). 195 \n 196 \nTerrestrial sources of DMS 197 \nDMS formation also occurs in terrestrial and freshwater environments, and, with 198 \nexceptions (see below), DMS formation in these environments is not due to DMSP 199 \ndegradation. As noted above for coastal sediments, the processes involved are 200 \nrespiratory reduction of DMSO (Zinder and Brock 1978c), degradation of sulfur-201 \ncontaining amino acids (Kadota and Ishida 1972; Kiene and Capone 1988), and 202 \n 10\nanaerobic degradation of methoxylated aromatic compounds (Bak et al. 1992; 203 \nLomans et al. 2001). Methylation of sulfide in aerobic microorganisms due to the 204 \naction of thiol-S methyltransferase has been demonstrated and predominantly gives 205 \nrise to MT (Drotar et al. 1987). 206 \nOverall, the emission of DMS from terrestrial and freshwater sources has not 207 \nbeen studied as intensively as that from the marine environment and as yet there is not 208 \na clear view of the relative importance of different production mechanisms. Wetland 209 \nemission rates of volatile sulfur compounds, including DMS, were subject to diel 210 \nvariations and an influence of plant communities was noted; in most wetlands, 211 \nemission rates were insignificant compared to those measured in intertidal sediments 212 \ndominated by Spartina (Cooper et al. 1989). Sphagnum-dominated peat bogs were 213 \nshown to evolve both DMS and MT, the formation of both compounds was 214 \nbiological, and methylation of MT was the main source of DMS (Kiene and Hines 215 \n1995). Soils may also emit volatile organic sulfur compounds including DMS and 216 \nfluxes can be enhanced by waterlogging (Banwart and Bremner 1976), but soils are 217 \nnot considered a major source of atmospheric sulfur (Andreae 1990; Watts 2000) and 218 \nvolatilisation of sulfur compounds  is not thought to contribute significantly to loss of 219 \nsulfur from soils (Banwart and Bremner 1976). Recently, DMS formation and 220 \ndegradation was observed in deeper layers (mainly below 1 m depth) along the profile 221 \nof an agricultural soil in Australia. The so-called agricultural sulfate soil investigated 222 \nin that study is in close proximity to a tidal inlet, may receive sporadic inputs of 223 \nseawater and thus is characterised by relatively high sulfate concentrations. It was 224 \nsuggested that DMS might be a potential source of the SO2 emissions that have been 225 \nobserved from this type of soils (Kinsela et al. 2007). The decomposition of plant 226 \nresidues in soil, especially those of crucifer species with a high content of sulfur-227 \n 11\ncontaining glucosinolates, can generate a number of volatile sulfur compounds 228 \nincluding DMS, MT and DMDS (Lewis and Papvizas 1970). Such locally enhanced 229 \nproduction of volatile sulfur compounds after amendation of soils with crucifer 230 \nresidues can be exploited in controlling soil borne phytopathogenic fungi. The bio-231 \nfumigant effects of crucifer tissue amendation were suggested to be mainly due to 232 \nisothiocycanates (e.g. Gamliel and Stapleton 1993) with additional contribution by 233 \nless toxic volatile sulfur species such as DMDS (Bending and Lincoln 1999). A 234 \ncombination of isothiocyanates and DMS was potent in inhibiting the activity of soil 235 \nnitrifying bacteria (Bending and Lincoln 2000).  236 \nIn freshwater environments, DMS and MT production may occur in anoxic 237 \nregions of stratified lakes and their sediments, as a result of sulfide methylation and/or 238 \ndegradation of methoxylated aromatic compounds (Fritz and Bachofen 2000; Lomans 239 \net al. 2001b; Lomans et al. 1997; Richards et al. 1991), but production of DMS has 240 \nalso been detected in oxic layers of freshwater lakes (e.g. Richards et al. 1991). DMS 241 \nin oxic freshwater lakes may be derived from phytoplankton and DMS release by 242 \nphytoplankton cultures was stimulated by methionine (Caron and Kramer 1994). 243 \nAlthough DMSP is not generally considered a major DMS precursor in freshwater 244 \nenvironments, DMS production in Lake Kinneret (Israel) appeared to be due to 245 \nblooms of the DMSP-containing freshwater dinoflagellate Peridinium gatunense 246 \n(Ginzburg et al. 1998). In a study of freshwater river sediments, Yoch and colleagues 247 \nfound that DMS was produced upon addition of DMSP to sediment slurries and 248 \nidentified DMS-producing Gram-positive bacteria (Yoch et al. 2001), demonstrating 249 \nthat the genetic potential for DMSP degradation was present far away from the marine 250 \nenvironment, although it was noted by the authors that the enzyme systems 251 \nresponsible for DMS production could have cognate substrates other than DMSP. 252 \n 12\n 253 \nDMS production by plants 254 \nPlants may be the main source of DMS in the terrestrial environment with a source 255 \nstrength estimated at 3.2 Tg a-1, of which half is thought to be derived from tropical 256 \nforests (Watts 2000). Plants emit a range of volatile sulfur compounds including H2S, 257 \nDMS, MT, COS, and CS2, with H2S and DMS usually the dominant species, but 258 \nemission rates are variable and dependent on many factors (reviewed by Schr\u00f6der 259 \n1993). In a study of environmental conditions that affect volatile sulfur emissions 260 \nfrom plants, Fall and coworkers (Fall et al. 1988) showed that DMS was the dominant 261 \nsulfur compound emitted by a range of crops including corn, alfalfa and wheat. Sulfur 262 \nfluxes were positively correlated with temperature and light intensity but were 263 \nindependent of the pCO2 (Fall et al. 1988). A similar correlation of DMS emission 264 \nrates and temperatures was found in a study of the gas exchange of DMS and COS of 265 \ntrees, but DMS emission was not a universal feature across the tree species tested and 266 \nit was concluded that the contribution of tree-derived DMS to the global sulfur budget 267 \nis negligible in temperate regions (Geng and Mu 2006). 268 \n 269 \nAnthropogenic sources of DMS 270 \nIn an industrial context, DMS and other reduced sulfur compounds such as 271 \nmethanethiol, dimethyldisulfide (DMDS) and hydrogen sulfide are products in the 272 \nwood pulping process, e.g. in the paper industry, and can occur in significant amounts 273 \nin liquors of the so-called Kraft process where it is a byproduct of the Swern oxidation 274 \nof alcohols to aldehydes (Omura and Swern 1978). The food and brewing industry, 275 \nagriculture and animal farming are also responsible for DMS emissions (Kim et al. 276 \n2007; Rappert and M\u00fcller 2005).  Anthropogenic sources of DMS are thought to be 277 \n 13\nresponsible for less than 1% of the total sources, but the emission of volatile sulfur 278 \ncompounds can be significant at the local scale. Due to the low odour thresholds of 279 \nvolatile organic sulfur compounds these can be a cause of nuisance odours (Zhu et al. 280 \n2002), for instance from wastewater treatment of paper manufacture (Catalan et al. 281 \n2008), or in the treatment of other sewage with high DMSO concentrations, caused by 282 \nreduction of DMSO to DMS under anaerobic conditions (Glindemann et al. 2006). 283 \nIndustrial operations providing composts for mushroom production (Derikx et al. 284 \n1990; Noble et al. 2001), field spreading of manure and application of biosolids, as 285 \nwell as livestock operations are further DMS sources linked to the agriculture and 286 \nfarming industries (Rappert and M\u00fcller 2005). DMS is also emitted from landfills, but 287 \nis less abundant than hydrogen sulfide (Kim et al. 2005).  288 \n 289 \n 290 \nSinks for DMS and related compounds 291 \nGiven the role ascribed to DMS in affecting atmospheric chemistry and climate, it is 292 \nof interest to understand the factors that control the flux of DMS to the atmosphere. In 293 \nsurface seawater the DMS concentration is determined by the rate of production 294 \n(mainly) from DMSP, and a variety of loss terms. Sea-to-air transport is dependent on 295 \nhydrological and meteorological parameters, for instance wind speed (Liss and 296 \nMerlivat 1986) and wave action (Watson et al. 1991). DMS is also photochemically 297 \noxidised in surface water to DMSO (Brimblecombe and Shooter 1986). Although 298 \nlarge quantities of DMS are produced in the upper mixed layer of the oceans, only a 299 \nsmall fraction of DMS escapes to the atmosphere, while the majority (estimated at 300 \n~90%) is degraded in the mixed surface layer due to microbial processes, including its 301 \nuse as either a carbon or sulfur source, or its biological degradation to DMSO (Archer 302 \n 14\net al. 2002; Hatton et al. 2004; Kiene and Bates 1990). The microorganisms and the 303 \nmicrobial metabolism of DMS are discussed below. 304 \n 305 \nDMS-degrading microorganisms 306 \nThe first insights into the microbiology of DMS-degrading organisms were obtained 307 \nby studies of Thiobacillus and Hyphomicrobium species beginning in the 1970s with 308 \nthe isolation of Thiobacillus strains from a pine bark biofilter that was used to remove 309 \nodorous compounds such as H2S, MT, DMS and DMDS from effluents of a paper 310 \npulp factory in Finland where these compounds were produced from methoxy groups 311 \nof lignin in the paper pulping process (Sivel\u00e4 and Sundman 1975). Further 312 \nThiobacillus species and isolates of Hyphomicrobium were then obtained that grew on 313 \nDMS as sole carbon source (De Bont et al. 1981; Kanagawa and Kelly 1986; Pol et 314 \nal. 1994; Smith and Kelly 1988; Suylen and Kuenen 1986). A diverse range of 315 \nmicroorganisms able to degrade DMS has since been isolated from a wide variety of 316 \nenvironments, including soils, plant rhizospheres, activated sludge, biofiltration 317 \noperations, seawater, cultures of marine algae, marine and freshwater sediments, 318 \nmicrobial mats and also humans from which DMS degraders have been isolated from 319 \nfeet and mouth samples. Table 2 lists species that have been shown to grow at the 320 \nexpense of DMS, while Figure 3 illustrates the identity of DMS-degrading organisms 321 \nin a phylogenetic context for representative strains with known 16S rRNA genes.  322 \n 323 \nMicrobial metabolism of DMS  324 \nThere are numerous biological pathways that contribute to DMS degradation in the 325 \nenvironment; in principal these serve (i) the utilisation of DMS as a carbon and 326 \nenergy source, (ii) its oxidation to DMSO by phototrophic or heterotrophic organisms, 327 \n 15\n(iii) and its utilisation as a sulfur source. Various types of DMS degradation pathways 328 \nhave been reported in the literature, some of these featuring MT and/or H2S as 329 \nintermediates, while other pathways do not give rise to volatile sulfur compounds. 330 \nThe scheme in Figure 4 provides an overview of the conversions of DMS and related 331 \nC1-sulfur compounds that occur in a wide range of different organisms. Details of 332 \nspecific biochemical conversions of DMS and microorganisms carrying them out are 333 \npresented below.  334 \n 335 \nUtilisation of DMS as a carbon and energy source for bacterial growth.  336 \nUtilisation of DMS as a carbon and energy source is thought to occur by one of two 337 \npathways that have been suggested which contain either a DMS monooxygenase (De 338 \nBont et al. 1981) or a presumed methyltransferase (Visscher and Taylor 1993b) 339 \ncarrying out the initial oxidation of DMS. It has been suggested that the 340 \nmethyltransferase is inhibited by chloroform while the DMS monooxygenase was 341 \nsuggested to be inhibited by methyl-tert butyl ether (Visscher and Taylor 1993b).  342 \n 343 \nDMS monooxygenase pathway. The work by De Bont and colleagues suggested that 344 \nDMS metabolism in Hyphomicrobium S involved an initial NAD(P)H dependent step 345 \nof DMS oxidation by a DMS monooxygenase (DMO), yielding formaldehyde and 346 \nmethanethiol (De Bont et al. 1981). DMO has also been suggested to be responsible 347 \nfor initial DMS degradation in some Thiobacillus strains (Visscher and Taylor 348 \n1993b). Formaldehyde is either directly assimilated into biomass or further oxidised 349 \nvia formate to CO2 in order to provide reducing power. Assimilation of the 350 \nformaldehyde produced during DMS and MT degradation in methylotrophic bacteria 351 \nis accomplished by the serine or ribulose monophosphate cycles (e.g. Anthony 1982; 352 \n 16\nDe Bont et al. 1981), while in DMS-degrading autotrophs that have been analysed 353 \nformaldehyde is oxidised to CO2, part of which is then assimilated into biomass via 354 \nthe Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle (Kelly and Baker 1990). Methanethiol produced by 355 \nDMS monooxygenase in the first step is degraded by MT oxidase to formaldehyde, 356 \nhydrogen peroxide and sulfide (Gould and Kanagawa 1992; Suylen et al. 1987). 357 \nFormaldehyde is again either assimilated directly into biomass or oxidised to CO2 358 \nwhile sulfide is converted to sulfite either by methanethiol oxidase (in the case of 359 \nHyphomicrobium spp.) or sulfide oxygenase (in case of Thiobacillus spp.) which is 360 \nthen oxidised to sulfate (via sulfite oxidase). Hydrogen peroxide is reduced to water 361 \nand oxygen by catalase and the growth on DMS of organisms utilising MT oxidase is 362 \nusually inhibited by the catalase inhibitor 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole.  363 \nThe biochemistry and genetic basis of DMS and methanethiol degradation in 364 \nthese isolates has remained largely uncharacterised, although methanethiol oxidase 365 \nwas purified from several species including Hyphomicrobium EG (Suylen et al. 366 \n1987), Thiobacillus thioparus Tk-m (Gould and Kanagawa 1992), and Rhodococcus 367 \nrhodochrous (Kim et al. 2000). MT oxidase from Hyphomicrobium strain EG (Suylen 368 \net al. 1987) was reported not to require any co-factors for activity. The insensitivity of 369 \nthis MT oxidase towards the metal-chelating agents EDTA and neocuproine 370 \nsuggested that the enzyme did not contain metal ions or haem co-factors. It was 371 \nsuggested that the native Hyphomicrobium enzyme was a monomer with a molecular 372 \nweight of 40-50 kDa, but MT oxidase from Thiobacillus thioparus sp. Tk-m (Gould 373 \nand Kanagawa 1992) appeared to be a monomer of 29-40 kDa. Two more recent 374 \nstudies reported purification of MT oxidase from Rhodococcus rhodochrous (Kim et 375 \nal. 2000) and a reassessment of the MT oxidase from Thiobacillus thioparus Tk-m 376 \n(Lee et al. 2002), giving molecular weights for these enzymes of ~61 kDa. It is not 377 \n 17\nclear whether different forms of methanethiol oxidase with different molecular weight 378 \nmay exist; in any case there is still a considerable lack of understanding of the 379 \nbiochemistry of methanethiol oxidation in bacteria. 380 \nAlthough the activity of DMS monooxygenase in methylotrophs and autotrophs 381 \ndegrading DMS under aerobic conditions was reported in a number of studies (Anesti 382 \net al. 2005; Anesti et al. 2004; Borodina et al. 2000; De Bont et al. 1981; Moosvi et 383 \nal. 2005), further information about the enzyme has not been forthcoming as it 384 \nappeared to be unstable and no purification has been achieved. No genes encoding a 385 \nDMS monooxygenase have been identified.  386 \n 387 \nMethyltransferase pathway. Thiobacillus ASN-1 used an alternative initial step of 388 \nDMS degradation which was independent of oxygen and which was suggested to be 389 \ndue to a methyltransferase (Visscher and Taylor 1993b). It was suggested that the 390 \nmethyl group was transferred to an acceptor molecule and then further oxidised via 391 \nfolate-bound intermediates. The methyl accepting factor was suggested to be 392 \ncobalamin related although it was not identified (Visscher and Taylor 1993a; b). 393 \nFurther oxidation of the remaining methanethiol appeared to follow the same scheme 394 \nas in the DMS monooxygenase pathway described above. 395 \n 396 \nDMSO2 and DMSO oxidation via DMS. In the initial study of Hyphomicrobium X 397 \nby De Bont and colleagues (De Bont et al. 1981) one of the substrates for growth of 398 \nthe strain was DMSO, which was reduced to DMS and thus fed into the DMS 399 \nmonooxygenase pathway. Subsequently, it was shown that DMSO2 could also be 400 \ndegraded by some methylotrophs via DMS, as enzyme activities for DMSO2 401 \nreductase, DMSO reductase and DMS monooxygenase were detected in cell-free 402 \n 18\nextracts of Hyphomicrobium sulfonivorans and Arthrobacter sulfonivorans growing 403 \non these compounds (Borodina et al. 2000; Borodina et al. 2002). 404 \n 405 \nGrowth on DMS under anoxic conditions 406 \nSeveral bacterial and archaeal strains able to degrade DMS and MT under anoxic 407 \nconditions have been isolated (Finster et al. 1992; Kiene et al. 1986; Lomans et al. 408 \n1999b; Lyimo et al. 2000; Ni and Boone 1991; Tanimoto and Bak 1994; Visscher and 409 \nTaylor 1993a). The thermodynamic aspects of growth of SRB and methanogens on 410 \nmethylated sulfur compounds have been reviewed in detail elsewhere (Scholten et al. 411 \n2003). SRB and methanogens are thought to be responsible for anaerobic DMS 412 \noxidation in anoxic sediments of coastal salt marshes, estuaries, and freshwater 413 \nsediments (Kiene and Capone 1988; Kiene et al. 1986; Lomans et al. 1999a; Zinder 414 \nand Brock 1978b), but the degradation of DMS has also been reported with nitrate as 415 \nelectron acceptor (Haaijer et al. 2008; Tanimoto and Bak 1994; Visscher and Taylor 416 \n1993a). The characteristics of methanogenic Archaea growing on DMS and MT have 417 \nbeen reviewed previously, isolates belonged to the genera  Methanolobus, 418 \nMethanomethylovorans, Methanosarcina and Methanosalsus (Lomans et al. 2002). 419 \nCompared to methanogens, relatively few SRB growing on DMS have been isolated. 420 \nTanimoto and Bak (1994) obtained Gram positive, spore-forming SRB from 421 \nthermophilic fermenter sludge which they classified as Desulfotomaculum species. 422 \nThese isolates were also able to grow on DMS using nitrate as electron acceptor 423 \n(Tanimoto and Bak 1994). Based on slurry incubations with tungstate and 424 \nbromoethanesulfonate addition to selectively inhibit SRB and methanogens, 425 \nrespectively, Lymio and coworkers found that the degradation of DMS and MT in 426 \nanoxic mangrove sediments was dominated by SRB (Lymio et al. 2009). A strain was 427 \n 19\nisolated, the first SRB from a marine environment, which was closely related to 428 \nDesulfosarcina sp. and exhibited very slow growth rates on DMS, but which had a 429 \nhigh affinity for DMS. The authors concluded that due to the extremely slow growth 430 \nobserved, such SRB might be outcompeted by methanogens in enrichments and slurry 431 \nincubations when relatively high DMS concentrations are used since methane 432 \nproduction increased exponentially during slurry incubations.  433 \nThe biochemical and genetic basis of DMS degradation in SRB remains 434 \nuncharacterised. More data are available for methanogens. It was shown that during 435 \ngrowth on acetate of the methanogen Methanosarcina barkeri the cells also converted 436 \nDMS and methylmercaptopropionate (MMPA) to methane and a corrinoid protein 437 \nfunctioned as a co-enzyme M methylase capable of DMS and MMPA degradation 438 \n(Tallant and Krzycki 1997). Fused corrinoid/methyl transfer proteins have been 439 \nimplicated in methyl sulphide metabolism in Methanosarcina acetivorans 440 \n(Oelgeschlaeger and Rother 2009). 441 \n 442 \nOxidation of DMS to DMSO 443 \nIn phototrophic bacteria, the oxidation of DMS to DMSO can be used to provide 444 \nelectron donors for carbon dioxide fixation as suggested by a study of DMS 445 \ndegradation by a culture of an anoxygenic phototrophic purple sulfur bacterium that 446 \nconverted DMS stoichiometrically to DMSO (Zeyer et al. 1987). Similarly, DMS can 447 \nbe utilised by certain phototrophic green sulfur bacteria when growing on reduced 448 \nsulfur compounds such as thiosulfate and hydrogen sulfide (Vogt et al. 1997). 449 \nDMS to DMSO conversion by heterotrophic bacteria was first described by 450 \nZhang et al (Zhang et al. 1991) in Pseudomonas acidovorans DMR-11 (reclassified as 451 \nDelftia acidovorans).  In this strain DMSO was stoichiometrically formed from DMS 452 \n 20\nas a product of co-oxidation during heterotrophic metabolism, for instance during 453 \ngrowth on a range of organic compounds, but no carbon from DMS was assimilated. 454 \nDMS removal in cell free extracts of strain DMR-11 was dependent on the presence 455 \nof NADPH, which could not be replaced by NADH. Complete conversion of DMS to 456 \nDMSO was also shown in the marine heterotrophic bacterium Sagittula stellata E-37 457 \n(Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 1997) in cells grown on glucose, irrespective of additional organic 458 \ncarbon being added during the assay. The enzymes responsible for the conversion of 459 \nDMS to DMSO in both Sagittula stellata and Delftia acidovorans are unknown. 460 \n 461 \nDMS dehydrogenase. The biochemistry and genetics of DMS to DMSO oxidation in 462 \nphototrophic metabolism in which DMS serves as an H donor have been studied in 463 \ndetail in Rhodovulum sulfidophilum (Hanlon et al. 1996; McDevitt et al. 2002). In this 464 \nstrain, DMS-dependent DMSO formation is mediated by DMS dehydrogenase 465 \n(DMSDH), a heterotrimeric enzyme comprising three subunits (DdhABC) in which a  466 \nmolybdopterin co-factor is bound to the A subunit (Hanlon et al. 1996). The enzyme 467 \nis encoded by the ddh operon containing the genes ddhABCD, which encode the A, B 468 \n(containing putative [Fe-S] clusters) and C (containing a b-type haem) subunits, and 469 \nddhD is thought to encode a polypeptide that could be responsible for the maturation 470 \nof the molypdopterin-containing enzyme (McDevitt et al. 2002).  471 \n 472 \nOxidation of DMS to DMSO by methanotrophs and nitrifying bacteria. DMS 473 \noxidation has also been observed in resting cell suspensions of methane-grown 474 \nmethanotrophic isolates of Methylomicrobium (Fuse et al. 1998; Sorokin et al. 2000) 475 \nand in Methylomicrobium pelagicum the product was identified as DMSO. The 476 \nnitrifying bacteria Nitrosomonas europaea and Nitrosococcus oceani (Juliette et al. 477 \n 21\n1993) also converted DMS to DMSO and some evidence suggests that ammonia 478 \nmonooxygenase (AMO) is the enzyme co-oxidising DMS to DMSO in these bacteria. 479 \nWhile the co-oxidation of MT by purified methane monooxygenase (MMO), the key 480 \nenzyme in aerobic methanotrophic bacteria, has been reported (Colby et al. 1977), it 481 \nis still unclear whether DMS is co-oxidised by MMO, although this seems likely 482 \ngiven the close evolutionary relationship of AMO and particulate MMO (Holmes et 483 \nal. 1995). 484 \n 485 \nReduction of DMSO to DMS by DMSO reductase. A range of microorganisms can 486 \ncouple the oxidation of organic carbon compounds to respiratory reduction of DMSO 487 \nto DMS under anoxic conditions (Zinder and Brock 1978a). The enzyme 488 \ndimethylsulfoxide reductase, which reduces DMSO to DMS, was first purified and 489 \ncharacterised from Rhodobacter sphaeroides. In this strain, it is a soluble periplasmic 490 \nsingle subunit enzyme of 82 kDa that contains a molybdopterin co-factor (Satoh and 491 \nKurihara 1987), which can also reduce trimethylamine oxide (Styrvold and Strom 492 \n1984). It is encoded by the gene dmsA (Yamamoto et al. 1995). A similar enzyme was 493 \npurified from Rhodobacter capsulatus (McEwan et al. 1991). The DMSO reductase in 494 \nE. coli is rather different. It is a heterotrimeric enzyme expressed under anaerobic 495 \nconditions, which is anchored in the periplasmic membrane. It is encoded by the 496 \noperon dmsABC (Bilous et al. 1988), in which the genes encode the active catalytic 497 \nsubunit DmsA (82 kDa) that contains the molybdopterin co-factor, an electron 498 \ntransfer protein DmsB (23.6 kDa) and a membrane anchor DmsC (22.7 kDa)  499 \n(Sambasivarao et al. 1990). Despite the differences in enzyme structure, the catalytic 500 \nsubunits of R. spharoides and E. coli share 29% sequence identity at the amino acid 501 \nlevel (Yamamoto et al. 1995).  In Hyphomicrobium sulfonivorans a membrane-bound 502 \n 22\nDMSO reductase that reduced DMSO to DMS was expressed during aerobic growth 503 \non DMSO2, thus not having a role in anaerobic respiration under these conditions. 504 \nOnly a weak cross-reaction was reported for the immunoblotting of H. sulfonivorans 505 \nmembrane fraction with an antibody against the R. capsulatus enzyme (Borodina et 506 \nal. 2002). The observation that DMSO reductase activity was present in the 507 \nmembrane fraction would suggest that it might be similar to the E. coli type DMSO 508 \nreductase, but that it is regulated differently to the E. coli enzyme. 509 \nDMSO reductase may carry out the reverse reaction in which DMS is reduced 510 \nto DMS, so it might be a candidate for DMS degradation in the environment. 511 \nHowever, although the enzyme from R. capsulatus can carry out the reverse reaction 512 \nin vitro, its Ks for DMS is high (1 mM) and DMSO strongly inhibits this reaction 513 \n(Adams et al. 1999), so it would appear unlikely to be relevant under physiological 514 \nconditions. The E. coli enzyme is expressed constitutively under anaerobic conditions 515 \n(Weiner et al. 1992). Overall, at this point there is little support to suggest that DMSO 516 \nreductases could provide a route of DMS degradation in, for instance, the oxic mixed 517 \nsurface layer of the oceans. 518 \n 519 \nAssimilation of C1 sulfur compounds as a sulfur source 520 \nIn addition to serving as substrate for growth of aerobic and anaerobic 521 \nmicroorganisms, DMSO and DMS can also be used as a source of sulfur. A strain of 522 \nMarinobacter was able to utilise DMS as a sulfur source with the aid of light, 523 \nprobably using a flavoprotein (Fuse et al. 2000). Pseudomonas aeruginosa can grow 524 \nwith methanesulfonate as a sole sulfur source, using the flavin-linked 525 \nmethanesulfonate monooxygenase MsuED (Kertesz et al. 1999) that is repressed by 526 \nsulfide, sulfite and sulfate. It is closely related to the alkanesulfonate monooxygenase 527 \n 23\n(SsuED) that is induced during the sulfate-starvation response in E. coli (Eichhorn et 528 \nal. 1999). Bacterial sulfur assimilation by these enzymes has been reviewed in detail 529 \n(Kertesz 2000). In a strain of Acinetobacter, DMS degradation via DMSO which led 530 \nto the assimilation of sulfur was observed. The enzyme oxidising DMS to DMSO was 531 \nrelated to multi-component monooxygenases oxidising toluene and similar substrates. 532 \nIt was termed DMS monooxygenase by the authors (Horinouchi et al. 1997), but this 533 \nis inappropriate as the degradation of DMS by this enzyme does not generate MT and 534 \nformaldehyde. Similarly Rhodococcus strain SY1 utilised DMS, DMSO and DMSO2 535 \nas sulfur sources and in both strains the sequence of oxidation started with DMS 536 \noxidation to DMSO which was oxidised to DMSO2 and further to MSA (Omori et al. 537 \n1995). Work on Pseudomonas putida DS1 suggested the latter was then a substrate 538 \nfor a SsuED type enzyme (Endoh et al. 2003).  539 \n 540 \nMSA catabolism 541 \nA different kind of methanesulfonate monooxygenase exists in methylotrophic 542 \nbacteria such as Methylosulfonomonas methylovora which can grow on MSA as a sole 543 \nsource of carbon and energy (Kelly and Murrell 1999). Its MSA monooxygenase is 544 \ncomposed of four distinct polypeptides. The hydroxylase subunit was composed of a 545 \n48 and 20 kDa subunits making up a native protein of around 210 kDa of a \u03b13/\u03b23 546 \nstructure. Further components were identified as a ferredoxin (32 kDa) and a 547 \nreductase (38 kDa). The enzyme subunits are encoded by the genes msmABCD (De 548 \nMarco et al. 1999) and the closely linked msmEFGH operon encodes proteins 549 \ninvolved in transport of MSA (Jamshad et al. 2006). Transcriptional analysis showed 550 \nthat msmEFGH operon was expressed constitutively while msmABCD was induced by 551 \nMSA (Jamshad et al. 2006). 552 \n 24\n 553 \nEcology of microorganisms degrading DMS and related compounds 554 \nEarly studies suggested that microorganisms catabolising DMS mainly belonged to 555 \nthe genera Hyphomicrobium, and Thiobacillus, additional isolation studies have 556 \nsignificantly extended the range of organisms able to grow on DMS (Table 1). In 557 \naddition to the shortcomings of microbial community analyses by cultivation-558 \ndependent approaches, there are particular difficulties that are often encountered in 559 \nisolation of DMS-degrading bacteria (e.g. Smith and Kelly 1988; Suylen and Kuenen 560 \n1986). The diversity of cultivable DMS-oxidising bacteria still precludes delineation 561 \nof major patterns in their distribution. It is almost certain that the true extent of the 562 \nphylogenetic diversity of  DMS-degrading organisms has not yet been identified, 563 \neither because organisms are recalcitrant to culturing conditions or due to the capacity 564 \nto degrade DMS being a phenotypic trait that is only rarely tested, even in studies of 565 \nmethylotrophic bacteria. This is most likely due to the low attraction of working with 566 \nthis smelly compound. The ability to degrade DMS is usually not conserved among 567 \nclosely related species, i.e. there is no perfect correlation of phylotype and phenotype. 568 \nThis largely negates the direct application of the widely used cultivation-independent 569 \nribosomal RNA approach for studying DMS degrading microbial populations in the 570 \nenvironment. Nevertheless some investigations on relevant environments, using 16S 571 \nrRNA genes as  markers have shown the presence of microbial populations that might 572 \ndegrade DMS, based on their relatedness to known DMS-degrading strains. For 573 \nexample, bacteria were found in marine DMS enrichment cultures (Vila-Costa et al. 574 \n2006) that were related to marine DMS degrading Methylophaga isolates (Sch\u00e4fer 575 \n2007). Also,  populations of related bacteria were detected in stable isotope probing 576 \nexperiments with 13C-DMS following a DMSP-producing phytoplankton bloom of 577 \n 25\nEmiliania huxleyi in the English Channel (Neufeld et al. 2008).  Further application of 578 \nSIP will allow improved definition of the phylogenetic diversity of DMS-degrading 579 \nmicrobial populations in environmental samples, but the approach can only detect 580 \nthose organisms that assimilate the carbon from DMS. Additional tools that target key 581 \nenzymes of DMS metabolism will therefore be required to map the diversity and 582 \nactivity of DMS degrading microorganisms. This will require new insights into the 583 \nmetabolism of DMS at a molecular level including studying the biochemistry and 584 \ngenetics of suitable model organisms in order to obtain a detailed understanding of the 585 \nenzymes and genes underpinning DMS degradation across a range of isolates. 586 \nMolecular methods targeting functional genes of DMS metabolism will not only allow 587 \nthe elucidation of patterns in the distribution of DMS-degrading microorganisms in 588 \nnature independent of cultivation, but will also highlight particular microbial 589 \npopulations for targeted isolation. Studying environmentally relevant model 590 \norganisms in more detail should also be useful in delineating the physiological 591 \nresponse of DMS degrading microorganisms and their potential to degrade DMS 592 \nunder varying environmental conditions. Many of the known DMS-degrading bacteria 593 \n(compare Table 2) are able to grow on a range of substrates. DMS-degrading 594 \nMethylophaga species, for instance, also grow on methanol and methylated amines 595 \n(De Zwart et al. 1996; Sch\u00e4fer 2007), two compounds which are present in the marine 596 \nenvironment in concentrations as high as 50-250nM in the case of methanol in the 597 \ntropical Atlantic (Williams et al. 2004). These concentrations are similar to or exceed 598 \nthose of DMS which are typically in the low nanomolar range (Kettle et al. 1999). 599 \nBeing presented with more than one growth substrate may have important effects and 600 \nthe physiological and transcriptional responses of DMS-degrading organisms under 601 \nsuch conditions require further study.  602 \n 26\n 603 \nInteractions of DMS-degrading microorganisms and plants 604 \nThe focus of most research on the synthesis and catabolism of DMS has been on the 605 \nmarine system. There is some evidence for production of DMS and other volatile 606 \nsulfur species by plants, but there are few data on emissions from vegetation in 607 \ntemperate and boreal regions (Watts 2000). The association with plants of microbial 608 \npopulations degrading DMS and related compounds is therefore of particular interest 609 \nfor future study.  Aboveground interactions of plants and bacteria occur in the 610 \nphyllosphere, which is the site of volatile sulfur emission. Previously, it was shown 611 \nthat plants harbour diverse populations of epiphytic and endophytic  612 \nMethylobacterium species (e.g. Abanda-Nkpwatt et al. 2006; Knief et al. 2008), 613 \nwhich are thought to thrive on methanol released from pectin metabolism in the cell 614 \nwall (Galbally and Kirstine 2002). Similarly, it might be expected that DMS emission 615 \nfrom leaves could help to sustain populations able to degrade this substrate. Such 616 \nphyllosphere populations would likely affect the net flux of DMS and other volatile 617 \nsulfur compounds emitted from plants. Whatever the function is of volatile sulfur 618 \nrelease by plants, organisms degrading these compounds have the potential to affect 619 \nthe functioning of the biological systems that might rely on volatile compounds. 620 \nEmission of volatile sulfur has been suggested as a route for removal of excess sulfur 621 \n(see review of Rennenberg 1984) or toxic HS- ions (Saini et al. 1995). A recent report 622 \nsuggests a role for H2S emission as a plant defence signal in the context of sulfur 623 \ninduced resistance of crops (Papenbrock et al. 2007). As a major volatile sulfur 624 \nspecies emitted by plants, DMS may have a role that has to be determined as yet.  625 \nThere is also potential for interactions between plants and C1-sulfur compound 626 \ndegrading microorganisms belowground. The activity of soil microbial populations 627 \n 27\ninvolved in cycling of organic sulfur compounds is of particular importance for 628 \ncontributing to soil fertility as the preferred sulfur source of plants is sulfate, but the 629 \nmajority of sulfur in soils is bound in organic form (Kertesz and Mirleau 2004). 630 \nRecent improvements with respect to anthropogenic emissions of sulfur from fossil 631 \nfuel combustion have lead to a reduction in man-made sulfate aerosols in the 632 \natmosphere and to a concomitant decrease in the rate of deposition of atmospheric 633 \nsulfur (Irwin et al. 2002). In some areas, the decrease in atmospheric S deposition is 634 \nleading to increasing incidences of sulfur deficiency for a range of agricultural crops, 635 \nsuch as oilseed rape (Schnug et al. 1995). Evidence for a decline of \u201cnatural\u201d sulfur 636 \nfertilisation of soils derived from atmospheric sulfur due to fossil fuel combustion is 637 \nprovided by changes of the sulfur isotope ratio in wheat straw (Zhao et al. 2003). 638 \nConsideration of future SO2 emission rates (McGrath and Zhao 1995) or future 639 \nclimate scenarios indicates that the potential for sulfur starvation in crops is likely to 640 \nincrease (Hartmann et al. 2008) with important consequences for agricultural 641 \nproductivity. Previous research has demonstrated that bacterial organosulfur 642 \ncompound degrading populations in the rhizosphere play an important role in 643 \nregenerating sulfate for uptake by crop-plants for instance, but work has so far 644 \nfocussed on the utilisation of alkane- and arylsulfonates and \u2013sulfates as sulfur 645 \nsources for bacteria (Kertesz and Mirleau 2004; Schmalenberger et al. 2008; 646 \nSchmalenberger et al. 2009). Further work is needed to fully appreciate the role of 647 \nmicrobial populations degrading C1-sulfur compounds such as DMSO, DMSO2 and 648 \nMSA, and the utilisation of these compounds as both sulfur and carbon sources in the 649 \nrhizosphere needs to be investigated. The potential importance of DMSO2 and DMSO 650 \ndegrading methylotrophs in the rhizosphere of plants has been demonstrated by the 651 \nwork of Borodina et al. (Borodina et al. 2000; Borodina et al. 2002). 652 \n 28\n 653 \nOutlook 654 \nDMS-degrading microorganisms are widely distributed in the environment, but there 655 \nis still a lack of insight into their phylogenetic and functional diversity. The 656 \ndevelopment and application of functional gene probes and stable isotope probing 657 \nexperiments will allow to decipher patterns in the distribution of DMS degrading 658 \nmicroorganisms in nature. Functional genetic markers based on key enzymes of DMS 659 \nmetabolism and that of related compounds will also allow to investigate in more detail 660 \nthe role of DMS degrading organisms in controlling fluxes of volatile sulfur to the 661 \natmosphere and will help to assess their contribution to metabolising organically 662 \nbound sulfur and returning inorganic sulfur back to the environment. Clearly, the 663 \nemission of DMS from the marine environment is controlled significantly by the 664 \nactivity of microorganisms. Microbial DMS metabolism affects the flux of DMS to 665 \nthe atmosphere and thus the composition of the atmosphere and global climate, 666 \ntherefore, the activity of marine microbial DMS-degrading microorganisms is 667 \nultimately also an important factor that influences the amount of sulfur transported to 668 \nthe continents where it affects the levels of sulfur in soils. Establishing the 669 \nphylogenetic affiliation of DMS degrading organisms in the environment and 670 \nidentification of the pathways used by microbial populations to remove DMS from the 671 \nwater column will help to identify the environmental regulation of marine microbial 672 \nDMS oxidation. This will contribute to gaining a better understanding of the complex 673 \nmicrobial processes involved in controlling the flux of sulfur from the oceans into the 674 \natmosphere and should be useful to improve the prospects of modelling marine DMS 675 \nemissions under future climatic scenarios.  676 \n 677 \n 29\nAcknowledgements 678 \nWe are grateful for funding provided by the Natural Environment Research Council 679 \nprovided through a studentship to R.B. and fellowships for H.S.

    "title": "Historical changes in the phenology of British Odonata are related to climate",
    "abstract": "Responses of biota to climate change take a number of forms including distributional shifts, behavioural changes and life history changes. This study examined an extensive set of biological records to investigate changes in the timing of life history transitions (specifically emergence) in British Odonata between 1960 and 2004. The results show that there has been a significant, consistent advance in phenology in the taxon as a whole over the period of warming that is mediated by life history traits. British odonates significantly advanced the leading edge (first quartile date) of the flight period by a mean of 1.51 \u00b10.060 (SEM, n=17) days per decade or 3.08\u00b11.16 (SEM, n=17) days per degree rise in temperature when phylogeny is controlled for. This study represents the first review of changes in odonate phenology in relation to climate change. The results suggest that the damped temperature oscillations experienced by aquatic organisms compared with terrestrial organisms are sufficient to evoke phenological responses similar to those of purely terrestrial taxa",

This study examined an extensive set of biological \nrecords to investigate changes in the timing of life history transitions (specifically emergence) in \nBritish Odonata between 1960 and 2004.  The results show that there has been a significant, \nconsistent advance in phenology in the taxon as a whole over the period of warming that is \nmediated by life history traits.  British odonates without an egg diapause significantly advanced \nthe leading edge (first quartile date) of the flight period by a mean of 2.73 days per decade \u00b1 0.055 \n(s.e.m., n=19) or 5.82 \u00b1 1.15 (s.e.m., n=19) per degree rise in temperature.  Species exhibiting a \ndiapause in the egg stage did not respond significantly to increases in UK temperatures.  This study \nrepresents the first review of changes in odonate phenology in relation to climate change and \nshows that responses to global warming are mediated by life-history traits.  The results suggest \nthat the damped temperature oscillations experienced by aquatic organisms compared to \nterrestrial organisms are sufficient to evoke phenological responses similar to those of purely \nterrestrial taxa. \n \n \n- 4 - \nIntroduction \nA trend in environmental warming is now undeniable (Karl & Trenberth 2003).  Whether \nanthropogenic or natural, the effects on a wide range of global flora and fauna are significant and \nstartling (Hughes 2000; Parmesan & Yohe 2003; Root et al. 2003).  Physiological limits for \ntemperature tolerance place restrictions on the persistence of organisms in the face of consistent \nchanging temperature.   \n \nCoope (1995) has highlighted three potential responses to persistent climate change: (i) the \nspecies can become extinct, (ii) the species can adapt in situ, (iii) the species can migrate to areas \nwith a more tolerable climate.  However, a\uff89W\u251d\uff77H\uff77\uff89\uff77\u30c7\u251e \uff77\uff90\uff74W\u30f4W\uff90\u30c7 \uff77\uff90 ;\uff90 \uff97\u30f4\uff6a;\uff90\uff77\u30b2\uff8f\u3052\u30b2 \uff89\uff77aW I\u251eI\uff89W \uff8f;\u251e H\u250caaW\u30f4 \nagainst the impacts of climate change, thus altering the threshold at which the organism must \nresort to one of those responses. \n \nIn order to cope with seasonal fluctuations in climate, complex life histories have evolved in \ninsects which permit maximum exploitation of warmer seasons while cooler seasons are survived \nby more resistant forms (Butterfield & Coulson 1997).  The mechanism for seasonal regulation \nmost commonly involves the use of cues such as environmental temperature and photoperiod to \ndetermine when to undergo life history transitions.  The issue of photoperiod has received \nattention in a variety of taxa (Butterfield & Coulson 1997; Gotthard et al. 2000; Johansson & Rowe \n1999; Laurila et al. 2001) and there has been much debate over possible mechanisms for time \nmeasurement (Vaz Nunes & Saunders 1999).  There is evidence that critical photoperiods are \n(Fleming & Tatchell 1995)changing at the same latitude over time as environmental warming \nincreases amenable growth season (Harada et al. 2005). \n \nWith changes in mean environmental temperature over the past century, it seems reasonable to \nsuppose that there will be concurrent changes in the timing of life history transitions.  Such \nchanges in phenology have been documented using biological records in a variety of British \nanimals, including Lepidoptera (Ellis et al. 1997; Sparks & Yates 1997), Homoptera (Fleming & \nTatchell 1995) and birds (Crick et al. 1997). \n \nThe Odonata are an ancient order, with all active stages of the life cycle being voracious \ncarnivores.  Distributional responses of some Odonata to environmental warming have been \nnoted in some anecdotal studies (Aoki 1997; Bonsel 1999) and recently Hickling et al. (2005) \nproduced a far more conclusive review of the British species.  This study showed that there was a \ntrend towards a northward shift in those range margins that occurred in Britain.   \n \nThe phenological response of Odonata to changing environmental temperature has not been \ninvestigated.  This study seeks to examine an extensive collection of biological records in an \nattempt to discern patterns in flight period for British Odonata over the recent period of warming.  \nThe flexibility in the odonate life cycle that permits variation in phenology is due to periods of \ndiapause which, depending upon species, can exist in the egg, larva and adult stages.  Previous \nstudies have shown patterns between purely terrestrial insect taxa and changes in ambient \ntemperature (e.g. Fleming & Tatchell 1995; Sparks & Yates 1997).  By contrast, this study \n- 5 - \ninvestigates the impact of changing environmental temperature on the phenology of a taxon that \nhas a sensitive period during an aquatic life history stage. \n \n- 6 - \nMaterials and methods \n \n(a) The BDS database \nThe British Dragonfly Society (BDS) maintains a database of sightings of Odonata from between \n1807 and the present.  At the time that the database was first analysed (28\nth\n November 2005), it \ncontained 448,547 records.  These records included sightings of individuals (as larvae, adults and \nexuviae) as well as separate records for selected behaviours (emerging, copulating and \novipositing).  However, only records of sightings of adults and exuviae in Britain between 1960 and \n2004 were included, since this period represents an anomalous period of warming (Jones & Mann \n2004) and increased recorder effort.  Records were also excluded if they were deemed to be \nduplicates or if they did not have a precise date.  This reduced the number of records to 268,772.  \nOnly records recorded between the latitudes of 50 and 52\u00b0N were included to control for \nlatitudinal variation in flight periods.   \n  \nOnly established, non-migratory British species were selected.  Aeshna mixta, although formerly \nmigratory, is now considered a British species.  Erythromma viridulum is still classified as a \nmigrant, even though it has bred consistently for the past 4 years, and would be of no use in this \nstudy due to its relatively short history in the database.  Similarly, the Sympetrum spp. that \nmigrate into Britain in waves before becoming extinct (S. fonscolombii and S. flaveolum) were \nexcluded from the analysis.  S. nigrescens was excluded on the basis that it most likely constitutes \na melanic form of S. striolatum.  This selection process left 37 species (see Table 1A).   \n \nThe annual mean of the Central England Temperature (CET) index was used as a general indicator \nof British temperatures and was obtained from the MW\u30c7 Oaa\uff77IW\u3052\u30b2  Hadley Centre.  CET has been \nfound to correlate with other regional temperatures and has been used in previous analyses of \nphenology (Sparks & Carey 1995; Sparks & Yates 1997).  The annual mean CET between 1960 and \n2004 was significantly correlated with spring (March, April and May; r=0.693, p<0.001) and \nsummer (June, July and August; r=0.701, p<0.001) mean temperatures and so was used as an \nindicator of general temperature change over the period. \n \n(b) Analysis \nFor each species the records were divided into time periods.  This was done in a species-specific \nway to maximise the resolution in each case.  The longest time period was a decade, with the \nrarest species being grouped into 1960-1969, 1970-1979, 1980-1989, 1990-1999 and 2000-2004 \nwhen there were between 30 and 499 records in each period.  Periods with fewer than 30 records \nwere excluded.  Where there were between 500 and 999 records in a decade, those records were \ndivided into two groups for the first and second half of that decade.  Where there were between \n1,000 and 4999 records in a decade, those records were divided into 3-year blocks (e.g. 1980-2, \n1983-5, 1986-8 etc).  In some cases decades exceeded 5,000 records and these were divided into \n2-year blocks (e.g. 1980-1, 1982-3, 1984-5 etc).  A conservative rule was required because records \nwere not evenly distributed over the years and so care had to be taken to ensure that sufficient \nrecords were present in each period. \n \n- 7 - \nSpecies were excluded if they could not be split into 5 or more time periods to maintain the \naccuracy of the estimated slopes.  This led to the omission of Aeshna caerulea, Aeshna isosceles, \nCoenagrion hastulatum, Coenagrion pulchellum, Gomphus vulgatissimus, Ischnura pumilio, Lestes \ndryas, Leucorrhinia dubia, Libellula fulva and Somatchlora arctica. \n \nThe date of each record was then converted into a Julian date.  The first quartile (Q1), median (Q2) \nand third quartile (Q3) were calculated from the distribution of Julian dates for each time period.  \nDue to small sample sizes (5-12 points) non-parametric regression techniques were used.  \nKW\uff90S;\uff89\uff89\u3052\u30b2 \u30f4\uff97H\u250c\u30b2\u30c7 \uff89\uff77\uff90W-fit method (Sokal & Rohlf 1995) produced estimates of the slope of the line \ndescribing the relationship between date and temperature and each of the 3 flight date statistics.  \nA p-value for each of the lines was obtained us\uff77\uff90\uff6a KW\uff90S;\uff89\uff89\u3052\u30b2 \u30f4;\uff90\uff86 I\uff97\u30f4\u30f4W\uff89;\u30c7\uff77\uff97\uff90\u304f  All 6 sets of slopes \nwere checked for normality (Anderson-Darling test) and homoscedasticity before being entered \ninto a GLM with taxonomic classification (Anisoptera/Zygoptera), presence/absence of egg \ndiapause (using information in Merritt et al. 1996; see Table 1) ;\uff90S I\uff89;\u30b2\u30b2\uff77a\uff77I;\u30c7\uff77\uff97\uff90 ;\u30b2 W\uff77\u30c7\uff74W\u30f4 \u3055\u30b2\u30ee\u30f4\uff77\uff90\uff6a\u3056 \n\uff97\u30f4 \u3055\u30b2\u250c\uff8f\uff8fW\u30f4\u3056 \u30b2\u30eeWI\uff77W\u30b2 (according to the definitions in Corbet et al. 1960). \n \n- 8 - \nResults \n(a) Recorder effort \nThe number of records in the BDS database is biased temporally, with vastly more records in later \nperiods.  When the Q1, Q2 and Q3 statistics for each of the species-specific time periods were \nanalysed against the number of records for the respective periods, there were non-significant \nrelationships between the number of records and Q2 (r=-0.102, p=0.114) and Q3 (r=-0.043, \np=0.507) flight dates.  There was a significant relationship between the number of records and the \nQ1 flight date (r=-0.135, p=0.036), but this explained very little of the variance (r\n2\n=1.4%) and can \ntherefore be considered unimportant. \n \n(b) Changes in phenology \nThere were no significant shifts in \u30ee\uff74W\uff90\uff97\uff89\uff97\uff6a\u251e \u30c7\uff74;\u30c7 \u30eeW\u30f4\u30b2\uff77\u30b2\u30c7WS ;a\u30c7W\u30f4 \u30c7\uff74W \u30f4WS\u250cI\u30c7\uff77\uff97\uff90 \uff97a \u30c7\uff74W \u00fc-value \nresulting from the Bonferroni correction.  However, the samples of \u028f-values for the Q1 flight date \nagainst both mean CET and date were found to be significantly different from zero using a 1-\nsample, 2-tailed t-test against a test mean of zero (Table 2).  Neither median nor Q3 flight statistics \nadvanced significantly in the taxon as a whole with temperature or date. \n \n(c) Traits affecting response \nTaxonomy, egg diapause and spring/summer classification did not have a significant effect on \nsamples of \u028f-values apart from the \u3055Q1 vs. year\u3056 sample, where species not exhibiting an egg \ndiapause showed significantly greater advances in phenology (Table 3).  \u028f-values for Q1 vs. both \nyear and mean CET were significantly different between those species exhibiting an egg diapause \nand those not exhibiting egg diapause (2-sample t-test, Q1 vs. year: t=-2.67, p=0.019; Q1 vs. mean \nCET: t=-2.98, p=0.008).  \u028f-values for species exhibiting an egg diapause were not significantly \ndifferent from zero but \u028f-values for species without an egg diapause were significantly below zero \n(Table 4 and Figure 1). \n \n- 9 - \nDiscussion \nAs a taxon, British Odonata have significantly advanced their phenology chronologically (on \naverage by around 2 days per decade (Table 1)) and with respect to temperature (on average by \naround 4.5 days per 1\u00b0C increase (Table 1A)) over a 45 year period (1960-2004).  This shift \nrepresents an extension to the preceding edge of the flight period (first quartile flight date) as \nopposed to a shift of the flight period as a whole.  This is the first phenology study of a taxon that \nis restricted to freshwater bodies to breed and concurs with the findings of studies on terrestrial \nBritish invertebrates (Fleming & Tatchell 1995; Sparks & Yates 1997). \n \nIn addition to being biased temporally, there is no doubt a bias towards the latter stages of the \nadult lifespan.  During the prereproductive period, odonates possess a negative taxis towards \nreflective surfaces, causing them to disperse varying distances from their natal water body (Corbet \n1999).  This is reversed to cause an aggregation at water bodies at the start of the reproductive \nperiod.  Many of the adults sighted will have been more mature individuals at water bodies where \nadults are at their highest concentrations and, hence, most noticeable.  The length of the adult \n\u30eeW\u30f4\uff77\uff97S \u2517;\u30f4\uff77W\u30b2 \uff6a\u30f4W;\u30c7\uff89\u251e HW\u30c7\u2518WW\uff90 \u30b2\u30eeWI\uff77W\u30b2\u304f  C\uff97\u30f4HW\u30c7\u3052\u30b2 (1999) analysis suggested mean adult \n(reproductive) longevities of between 6.7-37.7 (median=11.5) days for Anisoptera and 3.8-23.3 \n(median=7.6) days for Zygoptera.  This will introduce a small, unavoidable error into the \ncalculations.  The absence of difference in phenological response between Anisoptera and \nZygoptera suggests that varying longevities may not have an effect on the results. \n \nAnother factor that may influence results is the varying size of water body in which the different \nspecies live.  The size of the water body affects the buffering of ambient temperature fluctuations \nand, therefore, the perception of temperature by aquatic organisms.  However, odonates are \nknown to seek out warmer microclimates within water bodies (e.g. Aeshna caerulea, Sternberg \n1997), such as riparian vegetation, where such buffering is less effective.  The data are not \navailable to study this factor. \n \nPhenology of the Flight Period \nThe absence of a shift in the Q3 flight date is harder to explain.  Having concluded that most \nspecies are advancing in phenology, it would be sensible to predict that the end to the flight \nseason should either (i) advance in a similar way or (ii) regress to mirror the advance of Q1 about \nthe mean flight date.   \n \nIn support of the former prediction, daily survivorship is constant throughout adult life in many \nspecies (e.g. Coenagrion puella; Banks & Thompson 1985), with some studies showing a decline at \nthe beginning of the reproductive period (Enallagma hageni; Fincke 1982).  Therefore, if all \nindividuals share the same cue for seasonal regulation, they should all emerge, live and die at \nearlier points through the year according to a type II survivorship curve.  This pattern appears to \nbe exhibited by Pyrrhosoma nymphula, which shows similar advances in Q1, median and Q3 flight \ndates (Table 1). \n \n- 10 - \nThe latter hypothesis is based on the assumption that insects die or become less active in winter \ndue to abiotic factors such as falling ambient temperatures.  If global warming is alleviating the \ntemperature stress at the end of the flight season then it seems reasonable to expect that there \nwill be more individuals on the wing at a later date (especially in those species with asynchronous \nemergence periods).  Erythromma najas seems to follow this pattern, with shifts of similar \nmagnitude but in opposite directions in the Q1 and Q3 flight dates and little change in the median \n(Table 1). \n \nThe fact that neither of these patterns is seen as a general pattern in the taxon as a whole \nsuggests that (i) neither hypothesis is correct and there are other factors governing the species-\nspecific response of the latter part of the flight period, or (ii) that both factors are working \nantagonistically. \n \nPhenology and life-histories \nAs previously noted, Odonata possess a number of life history traits which allow regulation of the \nlife cycle in response to environmental conditions.  In the case of a diapause in the egg stage, eggs, \nonce laid in summer or autumn, enter developmental stasis where they remain over winter until \nwarmer spring temperatures (or an increase in water levels, in some cases) trigger a continuation \nof development.  The larvae then develop through the spring, emerging asynchronously in \nsummer.  Species which do not possess a diapause in the egg stage overwinter as late-instar larvae \nand use warming temperatures and photoperiod in spring as a cue for emergence.  Thus, as this \nstudy has shown, species without an egg diapause should have flight periods which are more \nsensitive to increasing temperatures than species that do possess an egg diapause. \n \n \n- 11 - \nConclusions \nThe Odonata are a warm-adapted taxon (Pritchard & Leggott 1987) which will certainly favour \ntheir chances of surviving climate change.  However, a reliance on bodies of freshwater, which are \npredicted to undergo marked change under current climate change models (Dawson et al. 2003), \nmakes their fate less certain.  Patterns seen here in Odonata are likely to be seen in other insects \nwith aquatic stages to their life cycles.  As a greater portion of the year becomes suitable for \nwarm-adapted taxa such as Odonata, there is an increased risk of successful colonisation and \npersistence by disease vectors, which appear to be shifting distributions as temperatures increase \n(Patz & Olson 2006).   \n \nAn ability to exploit temperate zones through the use of complex life histories while retaining \nthermal adaptations to warmer climates makes this taxon potentially one of the more resilient \ngroups of animals.  There is evidence that Odonata are able to shift geographical ranges (Hickling \net al. 2005), undergo evolutionary change to facilitate dispersal (Taylor & Merriam 1995), change \nresponses to cues to seasonal regulation (Johansson 2003) and, in the present study, take \nadvantage of climatic warming to expand their flight period through changes in phenology that are \ngoverned by life-history traits.  This response occurs in the same way as that of animals with a \npurely terrestrial life cycle, suggesting that aquatic and terrestrial life history stages have a similar \nsensitivity to environmental warming despite fluctuations being dampened in aquatic \nenvironments. \n \n- 12 - \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors thank the British Dragonfly Society for access to their historical database, the many \nrecorders who contributed to the database and the Hadley Centre for providing climate data.

Introduction\nClimate models have investigated the greenhouse effect, the\ntendency of the atmosphere to alter its characteristics to sun-\nlight so that different proportions of the Earth\u2019s black body\nradiation are trapped by the atmosphere, thus leading to\ndifferent climates. The most important component of this\ngreenhouse effect studied in the past decades has been car-\nbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere. Its storage in forests and\noceans, and its production by industry, are subjects of major\ninterest. More recently dimethylsulphide (DMS) molecules in\nthe atmosphere have been identi\ufb01ed as a potentially signif-\nicant modi\ufb01er of solar radiation re\ufb02ectance (Charlson et al.,UN\nPlease cite this article in press as: Cropp, R., Norbury, J., Investigations into a\nchange scenarios, Ecol.

(2004) also demonstrates that this\necosystem model can be further decomposed into two sub-\nmodels: a nutrient\u2013phytoplankton\u2013zooplankton (NPZ) model\nand a bacteria\u2013zoo\ufb02agellate\u2013nutrient (BFN) sub-model.\nThis GMSK non-linear ODE ecosystem model (which has\nfour degrees of freedom) possesses a very stable and some-\nwhat complicatedand interesting limit cycle; that is, a periodic\nset of solutions that correspond to regular plankton blooms\n(Cropp et al., 2004). It is often thought that systems with three\normore degrees of freedom should have chaotic solutions.We\n\ufb01nd that the biological parameters have to be changed signif-\nicantly in order to \ufb01nd pseudo-chaotic behaviour, and that for\nthemost part themodel is robust in its behaviour. Akey advan-\ntage of understanding our stable limit cycle is that it allows for\nthe identi\ufb01cation of the various complicated interactions and\nprocesses in the time-dependent non-linear dynamics. In par-\nticular, we explore the in\ufb02uence of mortality parameters that\nextend the time spent on one part of the limit cycle, or that\nshut off thephytoplanktonbloom, or that limit the importance\nof the larger species in the system.\n1.1. Mortality parameters\nExamination of the in\ufb02uence of mortality parameters on\necosystem model dynamics is also interesting and important\nin the context of modelling ecosystem responses to climate\nchange. It is reasonable to assume that most anthropogeni-\ncally unperturbed ecosystems, and most organisms within\nthem, are well adapted to their ambient environment, and\nin particular to the ambient temperature. Generally there-\nfore, species aremaintained near the centre of their ecological\nniches. Any change in climate (warming or cooling) will have\nthe effect of moving species from the optimal position in their\necological niche; where they have a relatively high reproduc-\ntion rate and a relatively low mortality rate, to a less-optimal\nposition where, for instance, reproduction is reduced and\nmortality increased. The response of ecosystem models to\nincreases in mortality rate is therefore useful as an indicator\nof the in\ufb02uence of climate change, and also of the suitability of\nparticular ecosystem models for applications in Earth System\nModels used to predict global climate change.\nMortality terms have also been identi\ufb01ed as being impor-\ntant determinants of ecosystem model dynamics (Steele and\nHenderson, 1992; Fulton et al., 2003). Although many forms of\nmortality have been proposed for use in ecosystem models,\nlinear mortality forms are often used because they are sim-\nple, require only one parameter each (parameters are often\npoorly known), and there are little empirical data to supportU\nPlease cite this article in press as: Cropp, R., Norbury, J., Investigations into\nchange scenarios, Ecol.

The choice of the form of closure terms has also\nbeen shown to have an important in\ufb02uence on the dynam-\nics of simple ecosystem models (Steele and Henderson, 1992;\nEdwards and Yool, 2000). These studies found that simple (i.e.\nthree-compartment, oftenNPZ) ecosystemmodels with linear\nclosure termsweremore likely to exhibit oscillatory behaviour\n(i.e. have limit cycles) than were the same models with other\nclosure terms.We therefore chose to examine the in\ufb02uence of\nall the linear mortality terms in the model.\nTheGMSKmodel presents an interesting case for the exam-\nination of the in\ufb02uence of linear closure terms as the GMSK\nlimit cycle may be considered the sum of the dynamics of its\nsub-models even though the full problem is highly non-linear.\nIt is also particularly useful for the examination of the in\ufb02u-\nence of mortality terms on model dynamics as its component\nsub-models both have linear closure terms but have very dif-\nferent dynamics. The NPZ sub-model has an asymptotically\nstable steady state while the BFN sub-model has a limit cycle\n(Cropp et al., 2004).\nWe initially explore varying three mortality parameters of\nthe GMSK model; k10 which controls the in\ufb02uence of the bac-\nteria mortality term k10B; k13 which controls the in\ufb02uence of\nthe zoo\ufb02agellate mortality term k123F and is the linear closure\nterm of the BFN sub-model; and k19 which controls the in\ufb02u-\nence of the zooplankton mortality term k19Z and is the linear\nclosure term for the NPZ sub-model. We note that the in\ufb02u-\nenceof k19 is quite different to that of theother linearmortality\nterms; unlike k10 and k13 which control the rate of switching\nbetween the sub-models k19 has no effect on the switching\nbehaviour.\nWe examine the in\ufb02uence of varying these parameters over\na substantial range (4\u20131000% of measured values). Species in\ntheir optimal position have a low mortality rate compared to\ntheir reproductive rate: moving them from this position has\nthe effect of lowering their reproduction rate and increasing\ntheir mortality rate. It is reasonable therefore, in a model in\nwhich the mortality rates are scaled relative to a reproduction\nrate, to examine the in\ufb02uence of quite large increases in mor-\ntality rates. The robustness of the model dynamics, in which\nthe limit cycle or attractor is maintained over large regions\nof the parameter space, and only subtly changes shape in\nresponse to parameter variations, is of ecological interest.\n1.2.

How-\nver we also \ufb01nd that the GMSK model\u2019s response to climate\nhange scenarios is very sensitive to the representation of\nortality terms. The GMSK model and a subtly amended\nMSK model make quite different predictions about ecosys-\nem responses to climate change: the former predicts an\nutotroph-dominated ecosystem, while the latter predicts the\nxtinction of all life. The primary function of our GMSK model\ns to estimate DMS production by ecological systems when\nubject to climate change. This is because DMS production\ntself feeds back on climate change. The above-mentioned\nwo outcomes predict profoundly different DMS production\nn warmer climates: the \ufb01rst autotroph-dominated outcome\nredicts a continuous, strong negative feedback on global\narming, whereas the second outcome predicts the extinc-\nion of life and a run-away greenhouse effect.\nThis result suggests that great caremust be taken in select-\nng ecological models used to predict the impacts of events\nuch as climate change that affect the processes represented\nn themodels. Formore local systems, our results suggest that\nhe addition of nutrients to otherwise stable plankton ecosys-\nems (as humans invariably do with sewage discharges and\ngricultural run-off) could fundamentally change the dynam-\ncs of those ecosystems from phytoplankton-controlled to\nicrobe-controlled.\nOf independentmathematical interest,we see that the \ufb02ow\nf this four-dimensional system always lies on the intersec-\nion of the positive orthant in B, F,N, P, Z spacewith the hyper-\nlane B+ F+N+P+Z=1 (the state variables are normalised so\nhat the total amount ofmatter in nitrogen currency is 1). This\nour-dimensional system together with possible parameter\nariation and solution state bifurcation, for most parameter\nalues, appears to possess a very stable periodic orbitwith dra-\natically different behaviour on different parts of the (highly\non-linear) orbit. Asymptotically stable states and apparently\nhaotic motion can also be found in the parameter regimes\nhat we explored. We \ufb01nally note that the attributes of the\nMSKmodel are largely described by the sum of the attributes\nf its sub-models in spite of the non-linear linkages of these\nodels and their (highly) non-linear solutions.\n.

Switching behaviour\nFigs. 2 and 3 do not reveal an important feature of the model,\nthe fact that the system spends very different amounts of time\nin the respective modes. This is evident in time series such as\nFig. 4a and b, where the system is in Mode Awhen oscillations\nin the panel (a) are decaying towards an equilibrium, and in\nMode B when the B and F populations undergo bloom events\n(see panel (b)) that comprise a single bloom-and-bust cycle\nthat \u201cresets\u201d the oscillatory decay of the P and Z blooms in\nMode A.\nThe system \ufb02ips from Mode A to Mode B when B escapes\nthe control of F. As themaximumrate of Fpredation on B (k8) is\nrelatively large, and near maximum growth is achieved at low\nB levels due to the relatively low value of F\u2032s half-saturation\nconstant of B (k9), this only occurs after both B and F have\nfallen to very low levels and the F growth term k8(B/B+ k9)F in\nEq.

As F will graze B to low levels rapidly due\nto the relatively large value of k8 this time scalewill essentially\nbe controlled by the F mortality term k13, as at low levels of B,\nF will decay like:\nF = FBmine\u2212k13(t\u2212tBmin ) (10)\nOnce Fhasdecayed tonear-zeroB canbegin to growand switch\nthe system from Mode A to Mode B. The timing of this switch-\ning is therefore dependent on themagnitude of k13 (Fig. 4e and\nf). During the period that B is prevented from blooming by F,\nthe system has approached the centre of the spiral in Fig. 2.\nAt this point N, P and Z are approximately constant and F is\napproximately zero.

Increases\nin k10 (i.e. k10 \u2192C*) cause the system to spend a longer period\nin Mode A before \ufb02ipping into Mode B. There are therefore at\nleast two characteristic time scales operating in the model to\n\ufb02ip the system dynamics between Mode A and Mode B. After\nthe system has attracted to the vicinity of CP 3 (see Fig. 2),\nand N, P and Z are relatively unchanging, the transition from\nMode A toMode B, related to the decay of the F population and\nsubsequent bloom of the B population, occurs on a time scale\nproportional to k10 and inversely proportional to k13.\nVariations in Z mortality cause the model to respond in a\nvery different manner to variations in the other two mortal-\nity rates (Fig. 5). Although k19 does not affect the switching\nbehaviour, it can affect the timing of the system dynamics,\nwith the frequency of oscillation increasing as k19 is reduced.\nThis parameter also has other, rather surprising effects; an\ninteresting consequence of reducing k19 is that the system\nappears to gain a \u201cmemory\u201d. Fig. 4a and b shows that for mea-\nsured parameter values the system \u201cresets\u201d to a state near CP 1U\nPlease cite this article in press as: Cropp, R., Norbury, J., Investigations into\nchange scenarios, Ecol.

However, Fig. 5a\nand b reveals that when k19 is very small, after the BFN cycle\nhas perturbed the NPZ cycle, the system returns to a point oname row and column in Table 3. Eigenvectors are described in BFPZ\nits NPZ trajectory where it would have been had it not been\nperturbed.\nThe system now exhibits a new Mode C that might be\ndescribed as a combination ofModes A and B.Mode C is essen-\ntially a BFNZ system: after a brief P bloom Z consumes P and\nthen decays like e\u2212k19t while N grows like ek19t. This transfer\nis intermittently perturbed by B growing on N, which subse-\nquently initiates an F bloom that rapidly consumes all of the B\nresource before decaying as e\u2212k13t. After F has decayed the sys-\ntem returns to near its previous position in the N\u2013Z transfer,\nin fact the place it would have been had it not been perturbed\nby the B bloom. Mode C therefore exhibits a \u201cmemory\u201d where\nit returns from Mode B to its previous position rather than\nresetting via CP 1.\nReduction of k19 also pushes the system into a state that\nappears potentially chaotic (Fig. 5c and d). However, numerical\ncalculation of the Lyapunov exponents of the system for low\nvalues of k19 using the method of Wolfe et al. (1985) reveals\nthat the system at no time becomes truly chaotic.

(53)\nA small further increase in k10 precipitates a second transcrit-\nical bifurcation in the BFN sub-model when CP 5 collides with\nCP 1, and CP 1 becomes a stable nodewhich, from Eqs. (37) and\n(45), occurs very close to the \ufb01rst bifurcation, at:\nk10 = k25(1 \u2212 k11)1 + k26\n= 0.3973. (54)\nAt this point CP 5 leaves the feasible regionwhen B\u22175 = 0which,\nfromEq. (45), occurs for the same condition as given by Eq. (54).\nCP 1 is then the only critical point of the BFN sub-model in the\nfeasible region, and remains stable for further increases in k10.\nVariations in k13 have more interesting effects. Evaluations\nof Eq. (43) reveal that the \ufb01rst event to occur as k13 is increased\nis that CP 4 changes from an unstable spiral to a stable spiral\npoint in a Hopf bifurcation (con\ufb01rmed by numerical inspec-\ntion of the vanishing limit cycle about CP 4) when k13 = 1.653.\nThis stability property is maintained until k13 = 1.760 when CP\n4 changes again, this time from a stable spiral to a stable node.\nThis property holds until CP 4 collides with CP 5 in a transcrit-\nical bifurcation when F\u22174 = 0 which from Eq. (41) occurs when:\nk13 = k8(1 \u2212 k14)\n(\nB\u22174\nB\u22174 + k9\n)\n= 1.798 (55)\nand B\u22174 = B\u22175 which from Eqs.

(51) and CP 4, previously a stable node, simul-\ntaneously becomes a saddle point and infeasible.\nThe direction \ufb01eld of the BFN sub-model for measured\nparameter values (Fig. 7) is characterised by the ubiquity of\nnear horizontal \ufb02ows pushing B towards zero throughout the\nfeasible state space, and the location of all critical points at or\nin the vicinity of F=0. This is due to the in\ufb02uence of the high\nmaximum rate of F predation on B. Once B is very close to zero\n(within 10\u22123), F decays and \ufb02ows on the F axis are vertically\ndown (this is shown in the expanded region of the BF plane\nin Fig. 7). After F has fallen to very low levels (again less than\n10\u22123), B can then grow and \ufb02ows along the B axis are directed\ntowards CP 5.\nThe dynamics of the BFN sub-model reveal an apparently\nclosed stable orbit, to which initial conditions both inside and\noutside the orbit are attracted, bounded by CP 5 and CP 1, and\ncontaining CP 4. This closed orbit, for measured parameterECOMOD 4512 1\u201321\na plankton populationmodel: Mortality and its importance in climate\nvalues, pushes trajectories we are interested in very close to 621\nCP 1, and hence they spend a long time near CP 1. Variations 622\nin k13 lead to a Hopf bifurcation of this closed orbit at CP 4, 623\nwhen CP 4 changes stability. 624\nD \nPR\nOO\nF\nARTICLE IN PRESSECOMOD45121\u201321\necolog ical modell ing x x x ( 2 0 0 6 ) xxx\u2013xxx 11\nFig. 7 \u2013 Direction \ufb01eld of the BFN model shown in BF state\ns\ni\n3625\nW626\nt627\nt628\np629\ni630\no631\n3632\nT633\nf634\nu635\no636\ne637\nm638\na639\na640\nJ641\nl642\nt643\n644\nh645\nA646\ns647\nN648\nB649\nU650\nf651\n\u0002652\n\u0002653\n\u0002CP 1\u22123 = \u2212k19, (61) 654\n\u0002CP 1\u22124 = \u2212k13, (62) 655\n\u0002CP 1\u20131 is always positive, while \u0002CP 1\u20133 and \u0002CP 1\u20134 are always 656\nnegative. \u0002CP 1\u20132 is positive formeasuredparameter values, but 657\nis negative for: 658\nk10 >\nk25(1 \u2212 k11)\n1 + k26\n= 0.397.

The nature of the system dynamics in\nthe regions near the critical points varies depending on the\nnumber of real and complex eigenvalues each point has, and\nthe direction in which the associated eigenvectors point. Val-\nues for the numerically calculated eigenvalues of each of the\ncritical points for the measured parameter values are given in\nTable 3, and thenumerically calculated eigenvectors inTable 4.\nEigenvectors of selected large magnitude positive (out-\nward pointing) and negative (inward pointing) eigenvalues are\nshown for each critical point in Figs. 2 and 3. The eigenvectors\nat each critical point were calculated numerically from the\n\ufb01ve-equation system to enable the eigenvectors to be plotted\nin both NPZ and BFN spaces (this calculation always resulted\nin one zero eigenvalue, which is ignored). The lengths of the\neigenvectors have been approximately scaled by the largest\nmagnitude eigenvalue at each critical point.\nThe importance of the critical points CP 3 and CP 7 is appar-\nent in Fig. 2. CP 3 is located near the centre of the spiral in the\nNPZ simplex plane,with CP 7 nearby just off the simplex plane.\nInterestingly, it is the critical point CP 3 (with B\u22173, F\n\u2217\n3 = 0) that\ncontrols the dynamics of the GMSK model, rather than the\ncritical point CP 7 that has all species extant. Although the\ndominant eigenvectors of both CP 3 and CP 7 direct the \ufb02ow\noff the NPZ simplex plane and towards the origin of the NPZ\nspace, the dominant eigenvalue of CP 3 is two orders of mag-\nnitude larger than the real part of the dominant eigenvalue\nof CP 7, and the \ufb02ow is observed to leave the simplex plane\nalong the dominant eigenvector of CP 3 rather than that of CP\n7. However, we note that the system is never actually on the\nsimplex planes as B and F in the case of the NPZ plane, and P\nand Z in the case of the BFN plane (Fig. 3) are very small but\nnever exactly zero; for ease of discussion we will not labour\nthis distinction.\nThe dominant eigenvector of CP 3 in BFN space directs the\nsystem towards CP 5 and \u2018onto\u2019 the BFN simplex plane. The\ntrajectory is captured by the attracting eigenvector of CP 5 and\nthen directed on to CP 1 and CP 4 by its repelling eigenvector.\nFig. 3 reveals that this eigenvector directs the \ufb02ow approxi-\nmately orthogonally to the attracting eigenvectors of CP 1 and\nCP 4 giving the appearance that a further critical point lies at\napproximately F=0.3, N=0.7, P, B, Z=0. However, this is not\nthe case as B has a large negative \ufb02ux and F and N have large\npositive \ufb02uxes in this region, indicating that the dynamics are\ncontrolled by the eigenvectors of CP 1, CP 4 and CP 5 and the\nmass conservation boundary.\n3.6.

The only critical points that become\nstable are CP 3, which now becomes stable at 0.506, and CP\n2 (P\u22172 = 1), which acquires stability at 1.111, the same value\nas previously observed for the bifurcation in the GMSK model\nand theNPZ sub-model. This bifurcation point is unaffected by\nthe simultaneous variations in k10 and k13. At this point also\nthe eigenvalues of all the critical points all become real. For\nmortality parameter values greater than 1.111, the only other\necologically feasible critical point is CP 1 (N\u22171 = 1). This critical\npoint has one positive eigenvalue (\u0002CP 1\u22121 = k23/1 + k24) that is\ninsensitive to all mortality parameter perturbations, indicat-\ning that CP 1 is always unstable.\nFig. 11 summarises the results of the bifurcation analy-\nsis, and demonstrates the robustness of the system\u2019s limit\ncycle dynamics to variations in k10, k13 or k19. The mortality\nparameters generally require substantial variations in value\nbefore fundamentally affecting the dynamics. The B mortal-\nity (k10) causes the earliest change, with a bifurcation from\nthe limit cycle to a stable spiral at 1.75 times its measured\nvalue. When all parameters are varied together, this bifur-\ncation occurs at a slightly higher value of k10 (1.96 times its\nmeasured value). The Z mortality (k19) is the next most sensi-\ntive parameter, with a similar bifurcation from the limit cycle\nto a stable spiral occurring at six times itsmeasured value. The\nlocation of this bifurcation point is unaffected by variations\nin the other mortality parameters. The limit cycle dynam-\nics are relatively insensitive to variations in the F mortality\n(k13), with the \ufb01rst bifurcation occurring at nine times the\nmeasured value, and the second at approximately 10 times.\nUnlike the bifurcations due to k10 and k19 these bifurcations\ndo not occur when all mortality parameters are varied simul-\ntaneously.\n3.6.5.

CP 1 then becomes the long-term state\nf the system for highmortality rates. There is therefore a fun-\namental difference between the climate change responses of\nhe GMSK and amended GMSKmodels: the former predicts an\nutotroph-dominated ecosystem, while the latter predicts the\nxtinction of all life.\nThe amended GMSK model also has a more realistic sta-\nility criterion for the critical point CP 1, where all living\nomponents of the system have died. Eqs. (116)\u2013(119) indicate\nhat the stability of this point is controlled by the mortal-\nty terms of the four biotic components. Eqs. (118) and (119)\neveal that while the heterotrophs, the zoo\ufb02agellates (F) and\nooplankton (Z), have non-zero mortality CP 1 is potentially\ntable. The stability of this point is then determined by the\nrowth/mortality ratios of the autotrophs, the bacteria (B) and\nhe phytoplankton (P). While either of these has a growth\nate that exceeds its mortality rate, CP 1 will be unstable and\nife will persist. Note that the stability of CP 1 is not affected\ny grazing parameters, suggesting that dynamics induced by\nrazing behaviours are self-regulating and will not result in\nhe extinction of life in the absence external forces.U\nPlease cite this article in press as: Cropp, R., Norbury, J., Investigations into a\nchange scenarios, Ecol.

Clearly, the GMSK model can\nreproduce observed data (Gabric et al., 2003; Cropp et al., 2004),\nand the modi\ufb01ed GMSK model is capable of reproducing the\nsame data, albeit with slightly modi\ufb01ed parameter values.\nHowever, these models would produce very different results\nif used to simulate the effects of global warming that pushed\ntheir constituent organisms to the limits of their respective\necological niches.\n4. Conclusions\nThe GMSK model has a complicated, interesting and quite\nrobust limit cycle that essentially comprises two modes of\nbehaviour that we have called Mode A and Mode B. The\nrobustness of this limit cycle is of profound importance to\nthe model\u2019s application in predicting the impacts of climate\nchange and the potential for marine ecosystems to amelio-\nrate that change by the production of DMS. This is because\nDMS is produced in Mode A and consumed in Mode B.\nWe found that the switching between Modes A and B was\ncontrolled by the coef\ufb01cients of two linear mortality terms of\nbacteria and zoo\ufb02agellates, k10 and k13. These had similar (but\ninverse) effects on the timing of the switching betweenmodes,\nbut had very different in\ufb02uences on solution state bifurca-\ntions, and the ultimate state of the model for large mortality\nparameter perturbations. We also found that the other lin-\near mortality term in the model that of zooplankton, k19, had\nquite different effects on the switching behaviour. Cropp et al.\n(2004) noted that this was an important term for dimethylsul-\nphide production, andhence potential amelioration of climate\nchange, but for different reasons.\nThe GMSK model may be decomposed into an NPZ sub-\nmodel and a BFN sub-model. Our analysis has demonstrated\nthat the GMSK model may be usefully described by the sum\nof its two component sub-models. The dynamics of each of\nthese sub-models combine to form the GMSK model\u2019s limit\ncycle. The shape of this limit cycle is largely determined by\nthe location and stability properties of the critical points. The\ncritical points of the sub-models contributemost of the critical\npoints of the full model, and although the GMSK model has\ntwo additional critical points in its own right, the dynamics\nof the full model appear to be controlled by the critical points\nof the sub-models. Further, the bifurcations observed in the\nsub-models are also evident in the full model, although the\nbehaviour in the full model is not as \u201cclean\u201d as observed in the\nsub-models. This suggests that insight into the behaviour of\ncomplicated ecosystem models might be assisted by analysis\nof any smaller sub-models into which they may reasonably be\ndecomposed.\nThe NPZ and BFN sub-models add an interesting dimen-\nsion to the discussion in recent ecological literature on the\nrole of closure terms in in\ufb02uencing the dynamics of ecological\nmodels (Edwards and Yool, 2000).

However we do note that the coef\ufb01cients of linear mor-\ntality terms and linear closure terms are important bifurcation\nparameters.\nOur results also point to the importance of bacteria in\nthe dynamics of ecosystem models. The presence of bacte-\nria destabilises the plankton model, and bacterial blooms are\nobserved to occur more frequently if bacterial mortality is low\nor if nutrient levels are high. The presence of a bacterial preda-\ntor however effectively controls the bacterial population, and\nrestricts the potential for microbial systems to dominate to a\nsmall region of parameter space.\nWe have also highlighted the importance of subtle vari-\nations in model formulation if the model is to be used in\nscenarios such as climate change that dictate that parame-\nter values must change. The inclusion of an explicit linear P\nmortality term to the GMSK model produces only subtle mod-\ni\ufb01cations to the dynamics for measured parameter values.\nMurray and Parslow (1999) have noted the importance of the\nformulation of the P mortality term in simple NP models, not-\ning that in the absence of explicit Z representation P mortality\nis a surrogate of the Z mortality of NPZ models. AlthoughMur-\nray and Parslow used their models to investigate the effects\nof nutrient load on coastal ecosystems, they noted that the\nform of the Pmortality term could also determine the stability\nproperties of steady state solutions.WhileMurray and Parslow\nconsidered some P mortality formulations to be inconsistent\nwith observed ecosystem dynamics, the inclusion a linear P\nmortality term to the GMSKmodel does not affect themodel\u2019s\nability to reproduce observed ecosystem dynamics, but may\nhave a profound impact on the model\u2019s behaviour when it is\nused in a climate change scenario.\nThus our original and amended models are virtually indis-\ntinguishable for our presently observed (experimental) param-\neter values, but when the climate changes, these models\npredict totally different outcomes. Our originalmodel predicts\na cycling or static autotroph-dominated outcome, whereas\nthe amended model predicts a global extinction. In terms of\nDMS production, which feeds back on climate change, these\ntwo outcomes are profoundly different: the \ufb01rst autotroph-\ndominated outcome predicts a continuous, strong negative\nfeedback on global warming, whereas the second outcome\npredicts the extinction of life and a run-away greenhouse\neffect. These very similar models therefore provide explicit\nexamples where the choice of ecological models for inclusion\nin climate change simulations could dramatically affect the\nsimulation results.\nAppendix A.

Kennett, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, and approved June 3, 2008 (received for review March 12, 2008)A major obstacle in understanding the evolution of Cenozoicclimate has been the lack of well dated terrestrial evidence fromhigh-latitude, glaciated regions. Here, we report the discovery ofexceptionally well preserved fossils of lacustrine and terrestrialorganisms from the McMurdo Dry Valleys sector of the Transant-arctic Mountains for which we have established a precise radio-metric chronology. The fossils, which include diatoms, palyno-morphs, mosses, ostracodes, and insects, represent the last vestigeof a tundra community that inhabited the mountains beforestepped cooling that first brought a full polar climate to Antarctica.Paleoecological analyses, 40Ar/39Ar analyses of associated ash fall,and climate inferences from glaciological modeling together sug-gest that mean summer temperatures in the region cooled by atleast 8\u00b0C between 14.07 \u0001 0.05 Ma and 13.85 \u0001 0.03 Ma. Theseresults provide novel constraints for the timing and amplitude ofmiddle-Miocene cooling in Antarctica and reveal the ecologicallegacy of this global climate transition.climate change \u0001 tundra biota \u0001 Dry Valleys \u0001 diatoms \u0001 ostracodsThe Earth\u2019s climate has been cooling for the last 50 millionyears in a trend punctuated by three steps. Higher rates ofcooling occurred during the late Eocene\u2013early Oligocene (c. 34Ma), the middle Miocene (c. 14 Ma), and the late Pliocene (c.3 Ma) (1). The step at 34 Ma is associated with the onset ofcontinental glaciation in Antarctica, and that centered on 3 Maregisters the expansion of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets. Themid-Miocene step, often referred to as the middle-Mioceneclimatic transition (MMCT), is the least understood, with sig-nificant questions surrounding its timing, style, and fundamentalcause. Marine isotopic studies imply significant ice volumeexpansion in Antarctica and coeval cooling of the SouthernOcean (2). Because of the paucity of dated terrestrial archivesfrom the continent, little evidence for climate change has beenavailable to constrain directly the nature and timing of theMMCT. This has resulted in a number of unanswered questions.To what extent did the continent cool during the MMCT, andwas this cooling gradual or abrupt? What effect did the MMCThave on the thermal regime of Antarctic glaciers? And from abiological perspective, what was the ecological legacy of theMMCT for organisms whose ancestors had survived the coolingstep at 34 Ma? Did the extinction of a shrub tundra occur duringthe middle Miocene, or was it delayed until the Pliocene (3, 4)?The fossiliferous glacigenic sediments reported here are fromthe western Olympus Range in the McMurdo Dry Valleys sectorof the Transantarctic Mountains. The fossils and their glacialgeologic context permit analyses of theMMCT from three broadperspectives: paleoecological, glaciological, and geomorphologi-cal. The in situ fossil-bearing strata occur within several north-facing valleys that open into McKelvey Valley, one of the majorice-free troughs of theMcMurdoDry Valleys (Fig. 1). Prior workhas shown that surficial deposits in the Range include a basalgroup of unconsolidated tills deposited from wet-based alpineglaciers and an overlying group of stacked sublimation tills fromcold-based alpine glaciers; on the basis of dated ashfall coveringthe oldest (stratigraphically lowest) sublimation till, the transi-tion from wet- to cold-based glaciation occurred before 13.85 \u00010.03 Ma (5). Results from our recent fieldwork show thatlacustrine deposits interfinger with wet-based tills deposited justbefore the transition, indicating that a series of small lakesdeveloped where recessional moraines impounded meltwater(Fig. 1). It is within these lacustrine sediments that we find wellpreserved freshwater fossils and pristine, bedded ashfall. A dateof 14.07 \u0001 0.05 Ma for an in situ ashfall layer, 3 cm thick, withinan extensive sequence of locally fossiliferous lake depositsprovides a direct, unambiguous age for the last phase of wet-based alpine glaciation and an age for tundra plants and animalsthat had colonized the locally deglaciated terrain [Fig. 1, sup-porting information (SI) Table S1, and Fig. S1].The best-studied fossil assemblage comes from a small (14,000m2) moraine-dammed basin at 1,425 m nearMount Boreas in thewestern Olympus Range (Fig. 1). Deflation by wind scour hasexposed lacustrine beds, which are unconsolidated, planar, andnear-horizontal except where locally disturbed by the develop-ment of polygonal patterned ground. At the basin center, thestratigraphy records infilling, first by glaciolacustrine silt andsand, later by diatom- and moss-rich muds, and finally by fluvialsands and debris f lows (Fig. 2). The diatom stratigraphy suggeststhat the lake persisted for thousands of years, during which timewater levels fell at least once and the floor of the basin becamea bryophyte-rich mire. The small alpine lake continued tosupport obligate freshwater organisms even during the low waterphase.Many of the fossils from the Mount Boreas lacustrine beds arepreserved in exquisite detail. Themajority represent aquatic taxathat inhabited the lake during an early shallow-water and laterdeep-water phase.

The mosstissues are freeze-dried and, like dried museum specimens, canbe rehydrated. Comparison with herbarium specimens showedthat the dominant moss species is indistinguishable from theextant Drepanocladus longifolius, a bryophyte within the semia-quatic Amblystegiaceae (Fig. 3 A and B). Between stems andleaves of the mosses, we have found ostracode carapaces rep-resenting several instars of a single species. Remarkably, softanatomy of appendages and mouth parts is preserved in a fewspecimens as a result of replacement by an iron oxide mineral,most likely goethite (Fig. 4A). The absence of key morphologicalcharacteristics presently does not allow the ostracodes to beassigned to a species, but their anatomy places them in thesuperfamily Cypridoidea. The numbers of specimens and thegenerations represented indicate that moss mats provided afavorable habitat for these benthic crustaceans to complete theirlife cycles.The shift to deeper water and associated changes in waterchemistry are recorded by changing assemblages of diatoms (Fig. 4B\u2013E). The shallow-water flora comprises colonial benthic fragilari-oid genera (Staurosira, Staurosirella, and Pseudostaurosira spp.),which occur in profusion and with remarkable preservation inassociation with the mosses. In overlying sediments, these taxa areprogressively replaced by the genera Encyonema, Eunotia,Gomphonema,Navicula,Pinnularia, andStauroneis. Toward the topof the diatom sequence, planktonic diatoms including Asterionellaformosa and Aulacoseira spp. appear with increasing regularity,likely a consequence of increased water depth to amaximumof 8m(Fig. 1C). The uppermost lacustrine strata contain only diatoms ofthe genera Eunotia and Aulacoseira.The diatom assemblages bear little resemblance to extantAntarctic f loras (6, 7), instead they have a far greater overallf loristic similarity to low ionic-strength lakes of the Arctic (8, 9).The floristic succession from benthic alkaliphilous fragilarioidsto planktonic acidophilous taxa, culminating with Aulacoseiraand Eunotia, denotes a pattern of progressive lake acidificationthat has striking parallels to postglacial lakes in the northernhemisphere, including the Arctic (10\u201312). Because natural lakeacidification occurs on time scales of several millennia, whetherdriven by edaphic (13) or climatic processes (12), a comparableinterval of deposition is envisaged for this diatom sequence.Moreover, the development of a diversified diatom flora con-taining both benthic and planktonic components implies that thewater-body was both permanent and seasonally ice-free. Thealgal f lora of modern perennially ice-covered lakes in Antarcticaincludes planktonic forms that are either neutrally buoyant ormotile (f lagellate). The planktonic diatoms reported here (Aula-coseira and Asterionella) do not fulfill these ecological prereq-uisites and therefore mandate circulation within the watercolumn to survive. Organic carbon isotope composition (mean\u000113C \u0002 \u000323.3\u2030) and organic carbon concentration (up to3.3%) of bulk sediment suggests that the lake was productive,mainly from algae with some aquatic mosses based on fossilcontent (Table S2).1000125015001750750NWet-based alpine tillMoraineLacustrine sediment175015001277\u00b0 30'161\u00b0 15'0 1 2 kmMt BoreasMt HerculesMcKelvey ValleyMt AeolusO l y m p u s   R a n g e0 m 300 mSSW NNE0 m5 mMoraine crestABCBasinFig. 1.

PNAS \u0001 August 5, 2008 \u0001 vol. 105 \u0001 no. 31 \u0001 10677ECOLOGYGEOLOGYIn addition to fossils of organisms that inhabited the lake, we haverecovered pollen and spores, and a few macroscopic remains ofplants and insects that inhabited the lake margins. The pollen andspore assemblage is the least diverse that has been recovered fromCenozoic sediments in theRoss Sea area and suggests a habitat nearthe climatic limits for plant growth (14, 15). The assemblage isdominated by Leiosphaeridia spp. and other algal cysts of uncertainprovenance. Angiosperm pollen is represented by abundant grainsofNothofagidites lachlaniae from a species ofNothofagus (southernbeech), rare grains of Periporopollenites sp., probably from a speciesof Caryophyllaceae (pink family), and two tricolpate pollen typeswhose natural affinity is less well known. Gymnosperm pollen isabsent, and the remainder of the palynoflora is comprised of sporesof Belgisporis sp. (liverwort, possibly Marchantiaceae) and Copto-spora spp. (mosses, possibly Bartramiaceae), and more rarely ofRetitriletes sp., a club moss in the Lycopodium fastigiatum group.Macrofossils of terrestrial plants are rare, consisting of stems andattached leaves of two species of small haplolepidous mosses. Theaffinity of one of themosses is unknown, whereas the other is eithera species of Dicranaceae (Dicranella) or Bruchiaceae (Fig. 3C).Insect remains are also rare. Most are submillimeter fragments oflarval head capsules, probably of a nematoceran Diptera (midge)species. The largest insect specimen is the base of a left elytron ofa small beetle with highly distinctive ornamentation (Fig. 3D).There are too few characteristics to enable it to be taxonomicallyassigned, but size, ornamentation, and cuticle thickness suggest thatit belongs to a weevil. From the palynoflora and the rare terrestrialmacroscopic remains, we infer that the slopes were mostly barrenwith patches of bryophytes. Although no wood or leaves of Notho-fagus (southern beech) were found within the sediments, its pollenindicates that it was growing within the region, possibly at lowerelevations. Our interpretation of a sparse lake-marginal vegetationis supported by isotopic data, which indicate minimal carbon inputto the lake from terrestrial sources (Table S2). The fossil biota,which included vascular plants, insects, ostracods, and diatomspecies that do not currently occur in Antarctica, is completelydifferent from the existing biota of theMcMurdo Dry Valleys. Themodern biota is dominated by prokaryotes, eukaryotes only inprotected locations, and small numbers of species of bryophytes,rotifers, tardigrades, nematodes, collembolans, and mites (16, 17).The existence of wet-based glaciers, proglacial lakes, tundravegetation, and insect remains all indicate that the climate of thewestern Olympus Range at \u000414.07 Ma was warmer and wetterFluvial facies (top to bottom):1) Planar-bedded, fine to medium sand, 37 cm thick.

Diatoms in lower 10 cm.Interpretation: Streams flowing from south and west deposited fans of sand and gravel, eventually burying the lacustrine sediments and filling the lake basin.  Debris flows, mostly entering from the west, washed material into the basin from nearby slopes of Mt. Boreas.Lacustrine facies:1) Massive, diatom-rich silt, 9 cm thick.

Interfingers with glacial debris flows near moraine.Interpretation:Deposits record two lacustrine phases separated by a shallow-water phase when moss colonized the basin. Initial lacustrine phase was proglacial. As fluvial sediments buried lacustrine beds, loading and sediment gravity flows produced soft-sediment deformation and rip-up clasts.Glacial facies:Glacially textured clasts within matrix of muddy gravelly sand, 0.5 to >2.5 m thick. Clasts lithologically identical to that of local bedrock. Striations on underlying bedrock indicate flow to the north. Interpretation:Till deposited from alpine glaciers flowing northward.

We are able to estimate summer warmth fromthe modern autecologies of several of the recovered taxa. Theclosest locations to the McMurdo Dry Valleys inhabited by themoss D. longifolius today is on James Ross and Vega islandsn atthe northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula (64\u00b0S) where themean summer temperature (MST) is \u00031.7\u00b0C.o D. longifolius issuch a widely distributed moss in both the northern and southernhemispheres (18) that we assume it would have colonized farthersouth in continental Antarctica if there were sufficient warmthand moisture to support its growth. Whereas the moss D.longifolius provides an estimate for the minimum thermal envi-ronment at the site, the paleoecology of fossil ostracodes andbeetle indicate a warmer MST. The nearest lakes with cypri-doidean ostracodes today occur in the South Orkney Islands(60\u00b0S) where MST is approximately 1\u00b0C (19, 20). Likewise, thesouthernmost records for indigenous beetles are for the island ofSouth Georgia (55\u00b0S), where the MST is approximately 5\u00b0C;plathridiid beetle species have been recorded farther south onSouth Orkney and South Shetland islands (62\u00b0S), but they areconsidered to be recent human introductions (21). Together, thefossil data suggest that MST was\u00045\u00b0C. In comparison, the MSTat the site today is approximately \u000312\u00b0C (22).To estimate the amount of cooling that occurred between thewet-based glaciation at 14.07 \u0001 0.05 Ma and the onset ofcold-based glaciation at 13.85\u0001 0.03 Ma, we used a steady-statethermomechanically coupled glaciological model with higher-order stress treatments (see SI Text). The model provides a testof basal-ice sensitivity for local alpine glaciers to varying atmo-spheric temperatures. Assumptions include minimal change inthe elevation of the western Olympus Range (23) and that theformer wet-based alpine glaciers were similar in size and shapeto modern cold-based counterparts throughout the McMurdoDry Valleys region; the latter assumption is borne out by detailedmapping of recessional moraines from wet-based alpine glaciersin the western Olympus Range. Model results show that themaximum atmospheric temperature consistent with cold-basedalpine glaciation in the western Olympus Range is \u00033\u00b0C (Fig.S2). Given that maximum atmospheric temperatures areachieved during summer, the value can be seen as a conservativeproxy for MST. If the landscape during the mid-Miocene wereat a lower elevation, as some models of landscape evolutionimply (24), then an even lower MST would be required tomaintain cold-based glaciation. The combined results frompaleoecology and glaciological modeling indicate a minimumdecrease in MST of 8\u00b0C between 14.07 and 13.85 Ma. Thisinterpretation is consistent with the timing of a sea-surfacecooling of 6\u20137\u00b0C between 14.2 and 13.8Ma inferred fromMg/Caratios of Southern Ocean planktonic foraminifera (2).An ongoing debate centers on when hyperarid, polar-desertconditions became established in Antarctica. At question is thelong-term stability of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet and whetherglobal warming during the Pliocene (\u00043 Ma) (25) resulted indeglaciation of the continental interior and permitted recoloni-zation of tundra organisms as far south as lat. 85\u00b0S (4, 26, 27).Our combined paleoglaciological and paleoecological resultsclarify several of these issues. First, the glacial stratigraphy andgeomorphology of the McMurdo Dry Valleys indicate that thetransition to cold-based, alpine glacial regimes at 13.85 Ma wasnever subsequently reversed (5). Second, the exquisite preser-vation of several fossil groups recovered from Miocene lakesediments (Figs. 3 and 4) indicates minimal postdepositionaldegradation, which is best reconciled by these assemblageshaving remained in a perennially dry and frozen state. Third,glass shards from the dated ash deposits show no evidence ofeither hydration or authigenic clay mineral formation (5, 28),suggesting essentially no chemical weathering. Taken together,these observations constitute robust arguments against the re-turn to warmer and wetter conditions at any time after theMMCT. Accordingly, we surmise that polar desert climate haspersisted uninterrupted in the western Olympus Range, and byinference all regions in the Transantarctic Mountains south of77\u00b0S, since at least 13.85 Ma. This climate reconstruction isincompatible with either amarked reduction in the volume of theEast Antarctic Ice Sheet inland of the McMurdo Dry Valleysregion, or with the recolonization by tundra biota during themiddle Pliocene.nBritish Antarctic Survey Plant Database, www.antarctica.ac.uk/bas\u0001research/data/access/plantdatabase/index.php.

PNAS \u0001 August 5, 2008 \u0001 vol. 105 \u0001 no. 31 \u0001 10679ECOLOGYGEOLOGYThe evidence presented here suggests that the climate of EastAntarctica cooled abruptly between 14.07 \u0001 0.05 and 13.85 \u00010.03 Ma. The ultimate cause of the climate change is uncertain.A decline in global pCO2, based on changes in stomatal densityon fossil leaves, has been proposed as the primary driver (29),although marine geochemical evidence suggests that pCO2 de-clined several million years earlier than the MMCT (30). Alter-native explanations focus on tectonically driven changes tooceanic circulation resulting in a reorganization of the ocean\u2013atmosphere\u2013cryosphere system (2, 31, 32). Regardless of theultimate cause, this shift was sufficient to initiate the transitionfrom wet- to cold-based alpine glaciation in the central andsouthern Transantarctic Mountains, and to induce the regionalextinction of tundra plants and animals. The only possiblesurvivors from this earlier biota are microscopic, mostly soil-dwelling organisms (33). The climatic and environmentalchanges reported here were likely the most significant to haveimpacted Antarctica since the initial onset of Cenozoic conti-nental glaciation. These results provide challenging but testabletargets for climate models, as well as new constraints forAntarctic biogeography.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS. We thank P.

ROSS ET AL.IntroductionWe are in the age of the Anthropocene. Human-induced elevations in anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) are warming and acidifying oceans across the globe. The rate of change is unprecedented on geological timescales (Collins et al. 2013, Lee et al. 2021) and is predicted to severely impact marine animals across all life-cycle stages and habitats (Kroeker et al. 2013, Byrne 2011, Ross et al. 2011, Przeslawski et al. 2012, Gazeau et al. 2013, Parker et al. 2013, Poloczanska et al. 2013, Byrne & Przeslawski 2013, Ross & Adam 2013, Przeslawski et al. 2015), although there continues to be debate about variation in responses (Hendriks et al. 2010, Gazeau et al. 2013; Figuerola et al. 2021) and the extent of marine organisms and life stages impacted (Leung et al. 2022). Climate models project that, by the end of this century, ocean acidification (OA) will be virtually certain, and depending on the shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP), surface ocean pH levels will decrease from the mean pH in 1950 by 0.1 unit in the best-case scenario (SSP1) to 0.45 pH units in the worst case scenario (SSP5-8.5). Ocean warming (OW) will also occur; sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) (Lee et al. 2021) will rise by 1.51\u00b0C (SSP, 1\u20132.6 range 1.02\u20132.19\u00b0C) to 2.89\u00b0C times (SSP5\u20138.5 range 2.01\u20134.07\u00b0C) (Fox-Kemper et al. 2021). Increased variation in the water cycle will also occur leading to increased precipitation, freshening (i.e. reduced salinity), and greater variability in storms, changes in ocean currents, and droughts across the globe (Przeslawski et al. 2008, Scanes et al. 2020, Lee et al. 2021).This rise in SST is being exacerbated by the increase in the frequency, intensity, and duration of Marine Heat Waves (MHWs) extreme heating events that have rapid and catastrophic consequences for marine ecosystem (Wernberg et al. 2013, Hughes et al. 2017, Hughes et al. 2019; Leggat et al. 2019, Smith et al. 2021) combined with hypoxic event (HEs) which together with OA and OW will potentially be more devastating (Oliver et al. 2018, Sampaio et al. 2021). To cope with changing ocean conditions, some marine organisms have migrated poleward (rate of 72 km decade-1 at their leading edge) resulting in novel species interactions and population structures (Poloczanska et al. 2013).Migration will only be successful if an organism has sufficient dispersal potential and suit-able habitat for settlement. Adult migration is not possible for sessile marine organisms which rely on larval dispersal. It is increasingly apparent that if marine organisms had to persist through the Anthropocene, they will need to be resilient to multiple stressors.Climate change stressors are likely to interact (Byrne & Przeslawski 2013). The few studies which have measured the interactions of multiple stressors, such as ocean acidification (OA), OW, and oxygen loss or hypoxia in the ocean (OD, ocean deoxygenation), have found additive, syner-gistic, or antagonistic effects on marine organisms (Bijma et al. 2013, Harvey et al. 2013, Gobler & Hannes 2016, Figuerola et al. 2021, Sampaio et al. 2021). Bijma et al. (2013) state that the OA, OW, and OD are the \u2018deadly trio\u2019, and in the past, such multiple stressors \u2018were often coupled with extinctions of major species\u2019 groups\u2019.In this three-part review, we focus on the resilience of marine animals to climate change mainly the dual major stressors of OA and OW (see Table 1). The first section defines resilience and adap-tive capacity. The second section summarises the resilience of marine animals focusing on mol-luscs, echinoderms, polychaetes, crustaceans, corals, and fish to climate change. Finally, the third section identifies the gaps in research required to determine whether marine animals will survive in the Anthropocene.Definition of resilienceDefinitions of resilience vary depending on the context and discipline in which resilience is applied. However, resilience is broadly defined as the capacity of system, i.e., an ecosystem, society, organism, or individual, to \u2018bounce back\u2019, maintain the same structure, functioning, and identity, and persist after responding or recovering from a disturbance or stress (Harrison 1979, Holling 1996, Nystr\u00f6m et al. 2000, Carpenter et al. 2001, Holling & Gunderson 2002, Folke et al. 2004, Bernhardt & Leslie 37SURVIVING THE ANTHROPOCENETable 1 Glossary of terms used to describe responses of marine animals to climate changeTerm DefinitionAcclimation The adjustment of an organism to experimental conditions in the laboratory without an adjustment in their genetics. Acclimation has been used to describe phenotypically plastic responses of organisms generated under controlled laboratory and experimental manipulations when the factor of interest can be isolated.Acclimatisation The adjustment of an organism to environmental conditions in the field or environment rather than the laboratory without an adjustment in their genetics.  Acclimatisation has been used to describe phenotypically plastic responses in natural conditions. Adaptation The evolutionary mechanism where natural selection of traits is genetically passed on, typically over many generations, to create an organism suited to the environment.  Adaptive capacity The capacity of the ecosystem or organism to improve and reorganise in response to stress such as climate change through phenotypic plasticity (acclimation, acclimatisation) or adaptation, distributional shifts, and rapid evolution of traits suited to new conditions.Epigenetics The modification of phenotype plasticity of an organism through altered gene expression without an alteration to the DNA sequence. \u2018Epi\u2019 means above the DNA and includes DNA methylation, modification of histones, and non-coding RNA. Fecundity The maximum physiological potential reproductive output of an organism to produce offspring (reproductive output). This differs from fertility, which is the number of offspring born.  Genotype The genetic characteristics of an organism.Hypoxia (Ocean Deoxygenation, OD) Low or depleted oxygen in marine ecosystems. This can occur when algal growth and oxygen consumption in respiration exceed photosynthesis and oxygen production. Oxygen loss or hypoxia in the ocean has been shortened to OD, ocean deoxygenation and hypoxic events to HEs.Multiple stressors Multiple disturbances or impacts that combine to cause stress on an organism, i.e., ocean acidification, ocean warming, decreased salinity, hypoxia, and inadequate food. Disturbances rarely occur in isolation and often combine as double or triple disturbances being additive, synergistic, or antagonistic. Additive is when the combined effect is equal to the sum of separate stressors. Synergistic is when multiple stressors combine to be greater than an additive effective. Antagonistic is when multiple stressors combine to be less than an additive effect. Ocean acidification (OA) Oceans absorb 25\u201350% of excess CO2 caused by greenhouse gas emission in the atmosphere as a result of  burning fossil fuels. IPCC report suggests that oceans will acidify and pH levels will decrease by 0.1\u20130.45 pH units depending on the shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) from a mean pH in 1950 of 8.1. Ocean acidification has been shortened to OA.Ocean warming (OW) Oceans absorb between 25\u201330% of excess heat caused by greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere as a result of burning fossil fuels. IPCC reports suggest that sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) will rise by 1.51 to 2.89\u00b0C times depending on the SSP by 2100. Ocean warming has been shortened to OW. (Continued)38PAULINE M. ROSS ET AL.Table 1 (Continued) Glossary of terms used to describe responses of marine animals to climate\u00a0changeTerm DefinitionPersistence The continuation of an ecosystem, society, or organism to retain the same identity through the processes of resilience or resistance.Phenotype The physical or morphological characteristics of an organism.Phenotypic plasticity The capacity of a marine organism and genotype to produce more than one phenotype and adjust their behaviour or physiology when exposed to different environments. Plasticity can either be adaptive (persistence in a new environment) or be nonadaptive (away from optimum).Resilience The capacity of an ecosystem, society, or organism to absorb disturbance and reorganise while undergoing change so as to retain essentially the same function, structure, identity, and feedbacks. Resilience reflects the degree to which a complex adaptive system is determined by its capacity to reorganise and adapt in order to avoid being disturbed again. Resistance The response of an ecosystem, society, or organism to absorb high levels of disturbance or stress without visible response to the disturbance.Selective breeding The process where an organism is bred for traits, also known as artificial selection.Stressors Disturbance or impact that causes stress on an organism, i.e., ocean acidification, ocean warming, decreased salinity, hypoxia, and inadequate food.  Trade-off The adaptive traits favoured for one or more conditions lead to reduced performance in another unselected trait. Threshold The boundaries of resilience. When an ecosystem, society, or organism is close to a threshold, a small amount of stress can breach the threshold and tip the system or individual over to an alternate state or individual collapse. These alternate states are difficult to reverse.Tipping point The limits of resilience are \u2018tipping points\u2019. Tipping points are reached when the cumulative effect of stress and challenges or large and traumatic events does not build resilience, is counterproductive, and tips over a threshold of tolerance to an alternate state.Transgenerational effects The phenotype and/or patterns of gene expression that are passed from one generation to the next which do not create changes to the DNA sequence.Transgenerational plasticity (TGP) The transmission of information from one generation to the next, i.e., across generations, which results in phenotypic changes to offspring without an alteration to DNA in response to the environmental stress experienced by one or both parents. Transgenerational effects can be adaptive, resulting in pre-adapted offspring that have traits with increased fitness because of the environmental conditions experienced by their parents.2013, Walker et al. 2004, Walker 2019). Walker (2019) states that resilience of a system is the capacity to absorb the disturbance or stress and reorganise while undergoing change so as to retain essentially the same function, structure, feedbacks, and most importantly, retain identity. Critically, resilience is not only \u2018bouncing back\u2019 but also the degree to which a complex adaptive system can learn, reor-ganise, and adapt (while retaining the same functions and identify) to avoid being disturbed again (Gunderson 2000, Walker et al. 2004, Adger et al. 2005, Walker 2019, Table 1). This capacity to learn is the component of resilience called \u2018adaptive capacity\u2019 (Holling & Gunderson 2002, Walker 2019).39SURVIVING THE ANTHROPOCENECritical to resilience is that the system must retain those traits that made that system unique, its identity, function, or even appearance (Carpenter et al. 2001, Adger et al. 2005, Walker 2019). If a system reorganises and loses its identity, then there is no resilience. In this way, resilience recog-nises that systems are capable of reorganising and building capacity to adapt to change perhaps as alternative stable states that retain the same controls on function and structure (Holling 1996) but may not exactly be the same (Gunderson 2000, Walker et al. 2004, Walker 2019). Walker (2019) also cautions on the misconceptions that resilience is simply the capacity to \u2018bounce back\u2019 or that it is always being thought of as desirable trait because reslience is also the capacity to \u201clearn\u201d and there are undesirable resilient systems such as algal colonised coral reefs.Persistence is a key aspect of resilience. If an ecosystem or an organism can no longer persist and ceases to exist, then resilience cannot exist (Holling & Gunderson 2002). Persistence can also be achieved through resistance. Some systems are capable of absorbing high levels of external pres-sure without experiencing a measurable disturbance and are therefore considered resistant (Table 1). Resistance has been considered a complimentary attribute of resilience (Carpenter et al. 2001) and sometimes resistance is distinguished from resilience (Lake 2013, Connell et al. 2016).Finally, preventing change does not improve resilience. Counter-intuitively, change improves resilience, i.e., probing at the thresholds or tipping points improves resilience and is a safe change (Walker 2019, Table 1). Resilience is a common mechanism by which systems persist and is often observed in biological systems (Holling 1996, Gunderson 2000, Nystr\u00f6m et al. 2000, Carpenter et al. 2001, Holling & Gunderson 2002, Walker 2019).Ecological resilience theory is often applied to marine ecosystems (Bernhardt & Leslie 2013), such as coral reefs (Hughes et al. 2010, 2017). Hughes et al. (2010) outlined a concept of ecosystem resilience that is defined by non-linear threshold dynamics in response to slow and fast drivers of change, alternate persistent phases, reinforcing feedbacks, and hysteresis. This concept emphasises the difference between slow stressors, such as increasing ocean temperatures, and fast stressors, such as a cyclone, which, when combined, can cause coral reefs to exceed thresholds and shift from coral-dominated to algae-dominated systems. Coral reefs are an ecosystem in crisis due to global warming and a range of human activities that have reduced their capacity for resilience through habitat frag-mentation and reduction of species and functional diversity (Nystr\u00f6m et al. 2000, Hughes et al. 2017). The non-linearity of responses to stress is not only evidenced in marine ecosystems but can also be observed in marine organisms. This review is novel because it focuses on the responses of marine animals to climate change rather than exploring properties and processes that enhance resilience of marine ecosystems (Bernhardt & Leslie 2013). By understanding the resilience of marine organisms, we may be better able to understand how marine animals and single species dominated ecosystems (e.g., oyster reefs) will persist in response to global climate change (Munday et al. 2013a).Importantly, when defining or measuring resilience, there needs to be a timescale relative to the issue that is under investigation (Carpenter et al. 2001). In this review, we utilised the year of 2100 as a reference point within the Anthropocene for the impacts of climate change (Collins et al. 2013, Lee et al. 2021), as per the IPCC reports (Collins et al. 2013, Lee et al. 2021, Fox-Kemper et al. 2021) and broader climate change literature.Adaptive capacity of marine organismsThe adaptive capacity of marine organisms in response to climate change is the capacity of an ecosystem, society, and organisms to learn or improve in response to disturbance or stress and take advantage of opportunities for change (Bernhardt & Leslie 2013, Hughes et al. 2017, Table 1). Adaptive capacity can occur through phenotypic plasticity (acclimation or acclimatisation), adaptation (genetic diversity), and distributional shifts (Reusch 2014, Bernhardt & Leslie 2013, Reid & Whitehead 2016). Phenotypic plasticity is the capacity of a marine organism and gen-otype to produce more than one phenotype and adjust physiology, morphology, or behaviour 40PAULINE M. ROSS ET AL.which improve the response of an organism in a new environment without altering their genotype (Munday et al. 2019, Table 1). While acclimation is reserved for adaptations generated under con-trolled laboratory experiments when the factor of interest can be isolated, acclimatisation refers to adaptations in response to fluctuations in natural conditions (Table 1). Although there have been arguments for the separation of acclimation and acclimatisation, which some authors argue is the \u2018cause of considerable confusion and logically meaningless\u2019 (Munday 2014), it is likely that there are different mechanisms driving responses of marine organisms in laboratory and field experiments, and thus, in this review, these two components of phenotypic plasticity have been described  separately.Phenotypic plasticity can allow organisms to build resilience to stress quickly, both within and across generations. Plasticity can occur within a generation, across a generation, and across multiple generations known as transgenerational plasticity (TGP) (Ross et al. 2016, Byrne et al. 2020, Table 1). Phenotypic plasticity is also a rapid response mechanism which may buffer populations against the impacts of climate change and provide the time necessary for genetic adaptation to occur. There can be costs and limits of phenotypic plasticity where an improvement in a characteristic or trait can result in a trade-off in another, which have the capacity to severely limit the fitness and survival of a species (Calosi et al. 2016, Chakravarti et al. 2016, Kelly et al. 2016, Collins et al. 2020, Parker et al. 2021, Table 1). For example, if an individual is better able to calcify under OA, but this resil-ience comes at a cost to fecundity, then this will reduce the supply of offspring and recruits to the next generation. There needs to be greater understanding of whether improvements in one or more traits in response to climate change can be maintained without trade-offs in other traits that ulti-mately limit the fitness, survival, and success of marine organisms (Calosi et al. 2016, Chakravarti et al. 2016, Kelly et al. 2016).The duration of phenotypic plasticity, and hence, its benefit in a constantly changing ocean is also not well understood. However, it is important to note that phenotypic plasticity may hinder adaptation. In contrast to phenotypic plasticity, adaptation is typically a longer process that occurs over many generations and involves the selection of tolerant genotypes which shifts the average population phenotype towards the fitness peak. Assessing the adaptive capacity of marine species over this century is somewhat difficult as many species possess long generation times and/or are challenging to maintain in the laboratory.In this review, we synthesise the responses and resilience of the major groups of marine ani-mals including shelled molluscs, echinoderms, polychaetes, corals, crustaceans, and fish to climate change with a focus on ocean warming and acidification. We define resilience as the adaptive capac-ity of marine animals to improve key physiological, morphological, and/or behavioural traits that are known to be impacted by climate change. Further, we explore potential adaptive capacities of marine animals which have been explored to date to change through phenotypic plasticity or adap-tation to near-future ocean acidification. Finally, we summarise the main challenges for the survival of marine animals in the Anthropocene.The resilience of marine animalsShelled molluscsShelled molluscs are ecologically and economically important in marine and estuarine environ-ments. Laboratory and field studies report negative impacts of climate change on early life-history stages, growth, energy budget, immune response, acid\u2013base balance, behaviour, and survival of mollusc species (Harvey et al. 2013, Gazeau et al. 2013, Kroeker et al. 2013, Parker et al. 2010, 2013, Lefevre 2016). Variability in responses has been observed among and within species, however, with some studies finding neutral or even positive effects of climate change on some life-history stages or traits (Hendriks et al. 2010, Figuerola et al. 2021, Leung et al. 2022).41SURVIVING THE ANTHROPOCENEStudies assessing the phenotypic plasticity capacity of molluscs to OA have predominantly focused on TGP. For many species, parental exposure to elevated CO2 can significantly reduce the negative impacts of elevated CO2 on larval, juvenile, and adult offspring (Parker et al. 2012, Ross et al. 2016, Parker et al. 2021, Lim et al. 2021, Table S1). For example, Kong et al. (2019) found that the negative effects of elevated CO2 on the fertilisation, larval size, and abnormality of the mussel, Mytilus edulis, were reduced following parental exposure to elevated CO2 (1100\u20132400 \u00b5atm for 4 w). Zhao et al. (2018a) found similar beneficial TGP effects in the clam, Ruditapes philippinarum, as juvenile shell growth decreased with elevated CO2, but this effect was no longer present when parents were exposed to elevated CO2 (1000 \u00b5atm for 10 w) during reproductive conditioning. The beneficial carry-over effect observed in offspring of R. philippinarum was found to persist, high-lighting the potentially long-lasting nature of TGP responses in molluscs to OA, possibly as a shift to more energy-efficient ion-regulatory mechanisms in the calcifying fluids of juveniles following parental exposure to elevated CO2 (Zhao et al. 2017, 2018a, b).In the Sydney rock oyster, Saccostrea glomerata, studies have found that TGP responses of mol-luscs to OA differ within a species between populations (Parker et al. 2012, 2021, Table S1). Parker et al. (2012) compared the TGP response of a wild and selectively bred population of S. glomerata to OA and found that, although the shell growth and development rate of both populations was improved following parental exposure to elevated CO2 (856 \u00b5atm for 5w), the improvement was greatest in the selectively bred population. Transcriptomic analysis found a differential abundance in the genes associated with the control of the cell cycle and maintenance of cellular homeostasis (Goncalves et al. 2018), suggesting that the selectively bred population had improved capacity to prevent apoptosis caused by oxidative damage.TGP responses of S. glomerata have also been found to depend on tidal exposure and habitat, respectively (Scanes et al. 2017, Parker et al. 2021). Despite being more resilient to OA than subtidal populations, populations of S. glomerata living in the high intertidal zone which experience epi-sodes of tidal emersion (air exposure) have limited capacity to improve this resilience via transgen-erational plasticity (Parker et al. 2021). It is also likely that TGP responses have carry-over energetic links (Gibbs et al. 2020, 2021a,b) and alter the microbiome (Scanes et al. 2021a,b).Finally, for a small numbers of mollusc species studied to date, TGP to elevated CO2 has led to neutral or negative impacts for offspring (Griffith & Gobler 2017, Venkataraman et al. 2019). In the clam, Mercenaria mercenaria, and scallop, Argopecten irradians, adult exposure to elevated CO2 (2500 \u00b5atm for 8 w) did not improve survival and shell length of larvae, and it increased the negative impact of elevated CO2 on larval metamorphosis. Collectively, these studies suggest that while shelled molluscs show great capacity for phenotypic plasticity to OA via TGP, the nature (positive, negative, or neutral) and strength of TGP responses will depend on the species, population, and habitat.The relatively long generation times of many mollusc species makes assessing their capac-ity for genetic adaptation to OA over multiple generations difficult (Thomsen et al. 2017). Consequently, adaptive capacity in molluscs has been investigated by examining local adapta-tion \u2013 where populations are experiencing naturally high CO2 (Johannesson et al. 2011, De Wit & Palumbi 2013, Thomsen et al. 2017). For example, in Keil Fjord in the western Baltic Sea populations of the mussel, Mytilus edulis experience episodes of low pH and elevated CO2 during their summer reproductive season. Thomsen et al. (2017) used a common garden experiment to compare responses of M. edulis populations from Kiel Fjord with that of a population collected from the North Sea, where pH and CO2 are less variable. They found larvae from Kiel Fjord were better adapted to elevated CO2 (2400 \u00b5atm) with greater shell growth and survival than larvae from the North Sea population at elevated CO2.The adaptive capacity of mollusc populations to OA has also been measured through assessment of tolerant genotypes (Parker et al. 2011, Fitzer et al. 2018, Stapp et al. 2018, Spencer et al. 2020). Stapp et al. (2018), for example, created genetically distinct family lines of the mussel, M. edulis, by crossing eight single dam-sires from a mussel population collected from Kiel Fjord in the Baltic Sea. After exposure to elevated CO2 (2400 \u00b5atm) during larval development, for some family lines, there 42PAULINE M. ROSS ET AL.was close to 100% mortality of larvae prior to settlement, while other families were more tolerant and successfully settled at elevated CO2. Family lines of the Sydney rock oyster, Saccostrea glomerata, also varied in their response to elevated CO2. Parker et al. (2011) exposed juveniles of 10 family lines of S. glomerata to elevated CO2 (1000 \u00b5atm) for 4 days following settlement. In eight out of 10 family lines, shell growth decreased with exposure to elevated CO2, but in two family lines, shell growth was not significantly affected. Fitzer et al. (2018) also found family lines of adult S. glomerata selected to grow faster and have resistance to disease had increased order in the crystallography of their shell compared to wild oysters.Historically, studies which assessed the phenotypic plasticity and adaptation capacity of molluscs to temperature have focused largely on temperature within their current thermal range (i.e., across their vertical and latitudinal distribution). Comparatively and surprisingly, however, our understand-ing of the phenotypic plasticity and adaptation capacity of molluscs to future warming oceans is largely in its infancy, particularly for populations living close to their upper thermal limit. General trends suggest that the capacity for molluscs to acclimate and adapt to OW will be species spe-cific. A study by Pereira et al. (2020), for example, found that acute exposure to heat stress (+6\u20138\u00b0C for 24 hours) improved the long-term survival of adults of the flat oyster, Ostrea angasi, but not those of the Sydney rock oyster, S. glomerata, when transferred to OW conditions (+4.38\u00b0C above ambient) in the field. The capacity for molluscs to acclimate and adapt to OW will also depend on where in the species\u2019 thermal tolerance range the population is located. Populations inhabiting low to mid positions of their thermal tolerance range will likely have greater capacity for phenotypic plasticity or adaptation to OW than those inhabiting the upper position of this range (Stillman 2002, Somero 2010, Tomanek 2010). For example, cold-adapted populations of the intertidal marine snail, Chlorostoma funebralis, collected from Northern California (USA), had greater than 50% survival when exposed to acute heat stress of 39\u00b0C, which is 4\u00b0C above the current maximum temperature they experience in the field (Gleason & Burton 2013). In comparison, warm-adapted populations col-lected from Southern California (USA) suffered 100% mortality at 41\u00b0C, a temperature which could be experienced in the field. The authors suggested that the warm-adapted populations are living close to their upper thermal limit and have limited capacity for phenotypic plasticity to OW (Gleason & Burton 2013). The studies that have considered the TGP response of shelled molluscs to OW have found negative responses. For example, when adults of the limpet Siphonaria australis were exposed to elevated temperature (25\u00b0C for 4w) compared to ambient temperature 16\u00b0C, the size of newly hatched larvae when reared for 24 hours and the viability of embryos at elevated temperature were reduced (Kessel & Phillips 2018). Based on the limited evidence available, it appears that the capac-ity of shelled molluscs to build resilience to OW may be limited, especially for molluscs living close to their upper thermal limit or in areas which are warming rapidly (Scanes et al. 2020).EchinodermsThe impacts of OA and OW as well as  the interactions between these stressors across echinoderm life stages (gametes to adults) and a broad range of traits (genes/cells to whole organism physiology) have been investigated in many studies, with most research on sea urchins (Byrne 2012, Dubois 2014, Evans & Watson-Wynn 2014, Foo & Byrne 2016, 2017, Byrne et al. 2018, Byrne & Hern\u00e1ndes 2020). Research on impacts of marine heatwaves is also emerging (Balogh & Byrne 2020, Gall et al. 2021, Minuti et al. 2021, 2022). Importantly, increased precipitation (i.e., reduced salinity) is particularly deleterious to echinoderms across all life stages (e.g., Russell 2013, Clements et al. 2022, Table S1).In general, acidification stunts growth of adults and calcifying larvae (Byrne et al. 2013a, b), whereas warming can stunt growth of adults and both calcifying and non-calcifying larvae, reflect-ing the temperature-size rule (Nguyen et al. 2012, Karelitz et al. 2017, Dworjanyn & Byrne 2018, Balogh & Byrne 2020) as well as reducing scope for growth due to the diversion of energy to acid/base regulation (Stumpp et al. 2011, 2012). For OA and OW as single stressors, amelioration 43SURVIVING THE ANTHROPOCENEof impacts can be achieved with provision of excess food (Wangensteen et al. 2013, Foo et al. 2020). However, for some species trade-offs in the presence of smaller larvae, juveniles and adults remained (Wangensteen et al. 2013, Dworjanyn & Byrne 2018). In multistressor studies, warm-ing within tolerance ranges can ameliorate the impact of acidification on calcification and growth (Byrne & Hern\u00e1ndes 2020). It is well known that parental exposure can dramatically shift the toler-ance of echinoderm progeny (Byrne 2011) and has been investigated in experiments where urchins were maintained in warming, acidification, and multistressor conditions before using their gametes to generate progeny (Table S1).Natural proxies of acidification conditions such as upwelling zones, estuarine gradients, and CO2 vents show the potential in sea urchins for climate adaptation through phenotypic adjustment and/or beneficial genetic selection. Populations of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus in the California Current upwelling system have experienced low pH conditions for thousands of years and their reproductive biology may be genetically adapted to low pH (Pespeni et al. 2013a,b, Gait\u00e1n-Espitia et al. 2017). The offspring of S. purpuratus from the upwelling system living in higher CO2 condi-tions are more tolerant of acidification than the offspring of parents from non-upwelling condi-tions with only a slight decrease in growth at pH 7.7 (Kelly et al. 2013). In a reciprocal breeding experiment with parents from high and low CO2 sites, the impact of acidification on larvae was lower if the mother originated from the high CO2 site, indicating phenotypic plasticity (Kelly et al. 2013). Similarly, the larvae of Paracentrotus lividus from tide pools that have low night-time pH (pH 7.4) are more robust to reduced seawater pH (Moulin et al. 2011). In contrast, the offspring of Echinometra sp. from a vent site reared in acidification conditions showed the same stunted devel-opment as larvae of non-vent urchins (Lamare et al. 2016) suggesting no positive effects of parental acclimatisation on larval growth.Sea urchins living at CO2 vents show considerable tolerance for acidification. Arbacia lixula, Paracentrotus lividus and Echinometra sp. can tolerate low pH conditions at vents and can even outperform conspecifics from ambient pH sites (Calosi et al. 2013, Collard et al. 2016, Uthicke et al. 2016, Foo et al. 2018a). Physiological mechanisms and indirect ecological effects (more food at vent sites) may determine the presence of sea urchins in future ocean conditions. It appears that a mean pHT 7.8 approximates the lower level of acidification for sea urchins to survive and succeed at CO2 vents (Calosi et al. 2013, Gonz\u00e1lez\u2013Delgado & Hern\u00e1ndez 2018), although at some of these sites pH can experience acidification to pHNBS 6.9 (Foo et al. 2018b).Paracentrotus lividus resident in vent conditions exhibited phenotypic plasticity in their immune system profile and antioxidant expression (Migliaccio et al. 2019). A physiological systems analysis revealed that the immune cells, the sentinels of environmental stress responses in sea urchins, had an altered proteomic profile in the vent urchins. Plasticity of the sea urchin immune system may facilitate success under acidification. The eggs of A. lixula from a vent site, but not those of indi-viduals from nearby ambient pH conditions, have a jelly coat that is more resilient to acidification, indicating plasticity in oogenesis to maintain gamete function in low pH (Foo et al. 2018b).These studies highlight the potential for traits across physiological systems (e.g., reproduction, immune, growth) to exhibit positive phenotypic responses to acidification. As the vents are open systems where populations receive gene flow from larvae generated in surrounding ambient condi-tions, it is unlikely that local genetic adaption has occurred. However, the vent environment is likely to exert strong selection on recruiting larvae and post metamorphic success, despite the potential for reduced genetic diversity (Lloyd et al. 2016).Many laboratory studies have investigated the potential that parental exposure to acidifica-tion conditions during gonad development will improve outcomes for offspring (Table S1). For Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis, the progeny generated by parents exposed to pHNBS 7.7 for 16 months exhibited increased resilience to acidification (Dupont et al. 2013). Fecundity was also similar to controls. The gonads would have fully matured under experimental conditions, providing a better opportunity for the gametes to be \u2018imprinted\u2019 promoting beneficial anticipatory plasticity.44PAULINE M. ROSS ET AL.Conditioning of Psammechinus milliaris at pHNBS 7.7 for 10 weeks showed positive effects for progeny (Suckling et al. 2014). Surviving larvae were larger, indicating that they were better able to calcify in low pH conditions, but as a comparative ambient pH treatment was not included, it is not possible to interpret the extent of this positive response. The marked reduction in larval sur-vival indicated deleterious effects. The short time that the adults were in treatments would not have allowed the gonads to mature in conditions with potential to generate negative effects. Following a 7-week adult conditioning of Echinometra sp. A in pHNBS 7.7, the larvae produced did not differ from those of control parents grown in the same conditions (Uthicke et al. 2013). Adult conditioning did not ameliorate the negative effects of acidification on larval growth, skeletogenesis, and abnor-mality. The conditioning period was likely too short to provide a beneficial outcome for progeny.Parental conditioning, the temperature at which gametes develop, influences offspring thermal tolerance. The offspring of mothers that experience warm conditions during egg development per-form better in these same conditions (Byrne 2011). The progeny of warm range edge populations are more tolerant of warm conditions than those from cooler climes (Byrne et al. 2011). For echino-derms with broad latitudinal ranges, populations may be sustained through recruitment of thermo-tolerant propagules (indicative of phenotypic plasticity) (Byrne et al. 2011, Harianto et al. 2018).Studies involving long-term exposure of adults to increased temperature show that the meta-bolic rate increases up to the tolerance limits (Carey et al. 2016, Delorme & Sewell 2016, Harianto et al. 2018). A 14-week exposure of Heliocidaris erythrogramma to a range of temperatures (+2\u20136\u00b0C) showed that this species maintained physiological balance at moderate warming (+2\u00b0C) with high survival, while +4\u00b0C resulted in higher metabolic rates (Harianto et al. 2018, 2021). Similarly, Evechinus chloroticus held at +4\u00b0C for 6 weeks had increased metabolic rate, reduced growth, and reproductive failure (Delorme & Sewell 2016). Conditioning of Strongylocentrotus intermedius at +3\u00b0C for 3 months resulted in decreased hatching and smaller larvae (Zhao et al. 2018c). The gametes are unlikely to have imprinted to the offspring environment.Habitat heating appears to be the contemporary climate change stressor of greatest concern, espe-cially during marine heatwaves. Many echinoderms live close to their upper thermal limits (Delorme & Sewell 2016, Brothers et al. 2016, Vergara-Amado et al. 2017, Collin et al. 2018, Harianto et al. 2018, 2021, Gall et al. 2021, Minuti et al. 2021). While exposure of adult H. erythrogramma to heatwave conditions had a beneficial influence on larval development, there were negative carry-over effects for the resulting juveniles, with higher mortality of the juvenile offspring of parents exposed to heatwave conditions (Minuti et al. 2022). There is a tight relationship between spawning, temperature and photo-period/food availability for echinoderms (Reitzel et al. 2014) and so OW/heatwaves are likely to cause a mismatch between spawning and optimal conditions for larvae.Conditioning of Sterechinus neumayeri in control, warm (+1.5\u00b0C), and two acidification-warming treatments (pHNBS 7.7/+1.8\u00b0C, 7.5/+2.1\u00b0C) for 17 months had positive outcomes for offspring (Suckling et al. 2015). The urchins maintained at pHNBS 7.5/+2.1\u00b0C had the largest eggs. This change was sug-gested to indicate higher investment to offspring under a warming scenario, a beneficial outcome. There was a trade-off, however, in higher larval abnormality, but no difference in the larval size indicating that adult conditioning in warm-acidification conditions ameliorated the negative effects of acidification on larval growth. This is likely due to +2.0\u00b0C countering the stunting effect of acidification on calcification in S. neumayeri (Byrne et al. 2013b). With the 17-month adult conditioning time, the gonads would have fully matured in the future offspring environment, promoting some beneficial outcomes.Heliocidaris erythrogramma maintained in multistressor OA and OW treatments over the entire gametogenic cycle with a seasonal offset for temperature (+2\u00b0C) and the seasonal photoperiod pro-duced juvenile offspring with a higher metabolic rate (Harianto et al. 2021). It is not known if this response is a positive or negative outcome.In a study where Tripneustes gratilla was reared from the juvenile stage to maturity in present day, acidification (pH 7.6, pH 7.8), warming (+2\u00b0C), and OA + OW treatments, the gam-etes of these F0 parents were used to produce F1 progeny reared in the same conditions in a 45SURVIVING THE ANTHROPOCENEcrossed design (Dworjanyn & Byrne 2018, Karelitz et al. 2019). OA and OW significantly affected growth of the F0 generation. They grew more slowly at pH 7.6, but not at pH 7.8. The urchins and their gonads were larger at the higher temperatures and warming offsets the nega-tive effects of acidification (Dworjanyn & Byrne 2018). Despite their larger ovaries, the eggs of females raised at +2\u00b0C were up to 21.8% smaller than those of ambient females, indicating selection for maternal fitness over reproductive investment. This change may have influenced F1 generation size.With respect to the F1 offspring, larval growth was affected by the interaction between tempera-ture and pH with responses depending on parental environment. Larvae from control parents raised in ambient conditions were larger than larvae from any other parent/offspring treatment group, indicating a negative transgenerational effect. The progeny of parents reared to maturity in warm-ing and OA+OW treatments exhibited a greater thermal tolerance and those of parents acclimated to OA had greater acidification tolerance.There was some indication of an adaptive response. Larvae from ambient parents were smaller if reared in OA, OW, and combined stressor treatments. Larvae from acidification parents that were also reared in acidification were similar in size in each treatment, and they were not affected by reduced seawater pH or warming. For larvae from parents raised in the warm conditions, acidification significantly reduced growth, but there was no significant effect of warming. Larvae of the OA+OW parents were larger in warm treatments compared to larvae from the same parents raised in warm conditions only. These larvae also did not show reduced growth in response to acidification.Larval morphological traits clustered according to parent source indicating that the environ-mental history of parents was the dominant factor, with offspring treatment playing a secondary role. Overall, despite some indication of beneficial effects, larvae of control parents raised in con-trol treatments were larger in all traits measured than larvae of parents acclimated in warming, acidification, or both. Larvae from warm treatment parents were smaller than those from the other parental/offspring treatment groups, potentially due to decreased egg size. This study highlights the complexity of TGP and the importance OW and OA on marine animals.In scenario-based studies, adult Echinometra sp. were maintained in ambient and two future climate scenarios (+1\u00b0C/685 ppm CO2, +2\u00b0C/940 ppm CO2) superimposed with seasonal fluc-tuations for 20 months to condition the gonads (Uthicke et al. 2020, 2021). With this experi-mental design, it is not possible to tease out the impacts of OA and OW as individual stressors. The gametes were used to generate F1 offspring. The larvae of the + 2\u00b0C/pH 7.8 parents were the largest and had the highest respiration rates. Overall, there was decreased survival in the progeny of the parents from the two scenario treatments, indicating negative carry-over effects (Karelitz et al. 2020). The larvae that did develop did not differ in size across parental treat-ments (control and two scenarios) (Uthicke et al. 2020). The resulting juveniles were then reared for 25 months in experimental conditions and their growth and physiological parameters were measured (Uthicke\u00a0et al. 2021). The urchins from the future scenario treatments experienced greater mortality, had depressed metabolism, and had decreased spawning capacity. Negative parental effects indicated little scope for transgenerational acclimation. For the crown of thorns starfish, parents in warm (+2C) and low pH (7.75) conditions for five months produced offspring with a higher survival rate than the wild type under these conditions indicating the potential for TGP (Hue\u00a0et\u00a0al. 2022).PolychaetesPolychaetes are dominant both in terms of diversity and abundance in marine benthic communi-ties from intertidal to abyss, as well as in estuarine and protected bays. Some polychaetes as adults are sedentary species living in tubes made of sand grains or calcium carbonate, while others move 46PAULINE M. ROSS ET AL.freely within the sediment. Many polychaetes have mass spawning events restricted to 1 or 2 days of the year and their gametes are released into the water column where fertilisation occurs resulting in pelagic larvae which may spend hours to weeks in the water column allowing for dispersal of larvae to distant sites (Jamieson et al. 2006). Changes in ocean currents may transport larvae away from suitable settlement sites and increased run-off from storms may result in changes in salinity and turbidity which can impact juvenile survival, growth, and maturation (Qiu & Qian 1998).In the limited number of polychaetes studied, OA interferes in the formation of the calcareous tubes of serpulids as well as weakening existing tubes (Wood et al. 2008, Smith et al. 2013, Li et al. 2014). This potentially makes them more vulnerable to predators and storm damage. Laboratory studies showed that increased acidification (pH 7.6) impacted the progeny of the invasive serpulid Hydroides elegans and that larvae had delayed metamorphosis as well as growth rates, confirm-ing transgenerational responses (Lane et al. 2015). Another invasive serpulid species when raised in increasing levels of acidification exhibited smaller trochophores and built shorter and more fragile tubes when raised at pH 7.4, although settlement rates were similar to those found in the field (D\u00edaz-Casta\u0148eda et al. 2019). Thus, increased acidification will lead to losses of reefs built by gregarious tube building serpulids, which create habitat for many other invertebrates leading to restructuring of communities that depend on these ecosystem engineers (Poloczanska & Butler 2010). Oysters subjected to elevated temperatures and changes in OA that disrupt the mineralisa-tion of their shells will be subject to higher rates of infestation by boring polydorids increasing the mortality of the molluscs and reducing their commercial value (David 2021). This is an example of adaptation whereby the polydorids benefit from reduced shell strength of the oysters. It has been suggested that polychaetes living in volcanic habitats which are brooders or direct developers exhibit a pre-adaptive trait to enhance survival in such acidified waters (Lucey et al. 2015). Some evidence that a sabellid can adapt to increased acidification by reducing its body weight compared to animals living in normal seawater (Del Pasqua et al. 2019). As the cues to spawn for many poly-chaetes are related to changes in water temperature, any increases due to climate change almost certainly will impact on spawning and likely to produce pelagic larvae out of sync with food sup-plies (Olive 1995, Bates 2005).Trans- and multigeneration studies with respect to climate change have largely been focused on one polychaete species, Ophryotrocha labronica (from the Mediterranean). This cosmopolitan invasive species occurs in fouling communities (Massamba-N\u2019Sial et al. 2012). This small species which is easy to rear in the laboratory with a short generation time (17 days), weekly production of egg masses, and parental care is a good model for multigenerational studies (Chakravarti et al. 2016). Parental care is provided throughout development by swimming through the egg mass ensuring a constant supply of oxygen and preventing parasites from growing on the egg mass. Studies showed that transgenerational exposure to OA and OW had negative effects on fecundity, egg volume, hatch-ing success, and juvenile development (Chakravarti et al. 2016). Another study on a population of this species maintained for about 30 generations raised in fluctuating pH (NBS 7.4\u20138.4) and then exposed to unvarying pH 7.7 for a further six generations showed initial (F1, F2) negative effects of acidi-fication. However, by F3\u2013F7, fecundity levels were restored, and offspring performance improved (Rodr\u00edguez-Romero et al. 2016). Later transgenerational studies were carried out by Gibbin et al. (2017a,b) who exposed individuals of this species for six generations to four experimental condi-tions including increased water temperatures (+3\u00b0C) and acidification (\u22120.4 pH). They found that this produced faster growing worms, which reproduce earlier, but were smaller in size and hence had a reduced reproductive output. Such multigenerational studies are rare. Subsequent studies by Jarrold et al. (2019) investigated transgenerational exposure. They transplanted progeny at generations F3, F4, and F5 between control and ocean warming and acidification, but significant changes in the level of plasticity across generations were few. Only juvenile development rate under the combined scenario modified transplant effect across generations \u2013  suggesting that this trait evolves to an increase in plasticity \u2013 when transplanted back to control conditions. Adaptive plasticity was conserved in most 47SURVIVING THE ANTHROPOCENEtraits despite significant levels of selection and strong declines in individual fitness in multigenera-tional exposure. So, while this species has been used as a model system to investigate the impact of climate change stressors over generations, all of those studies were carried out on a laboratory population that was maintained for years over thousands of generations and fed spinach. Exactly how relevant this is to other polychaetes in the field is unclear which suggests that all of these data should be treated with caution.CrustaceansCrustaceans are a highly diverse group of economically and ecologically important species which play critical roles in trophic energy transfer. Crustaceans are expected to be tolerant of OA and OW due to their ability to buffer acid-based changes via the accumulation of bicarbonate as a buffer when challenged by reduced pH (Truchot 1979, Pane & Barry 2007, P\u00f6rtner et al. 2004) and lack of intensively calcified skeletal structures (Whiteley 2011). Pane and Barry (2007) found that while a shallow-water crab Cancer magister can compensate to short-term hypercapnia-induced acidosis, a deep water species Chionoecetes tanneri cannot compensate. It is suggested that deep-sea animals are adapted to a stable environment and have reduced metabolic rates compared to shallow-water species, and that their sequestration in oxygen-poor areas of the ocean would be detrimental to deep-sea fauna.Copepods and amphipods with chiton-dominated skeletons are less sensitive to OA than lob-sters with more heavily calcified skeletons (Whiteley 2011, Wang et al. 2018). With relatively short life cycles, i.e. days to months, crustaceans serve as a model to study trans- and multigenerational plasticity response of marine animals to climate change (Byrne et al. 2020, Table S1).In the ecologically important amphipod Gammarus locusta, there was a strong negative trans-generational effect of acidification with 10\u201315% decreased survival and reproductive fitness (Borges et al. 2018) and reduced hatching success (Cardoso et al. 2018) because of increased oxidative stress (Lopes et al. 2019). When brooding females of Sunamiphitoe parmerong were maintained in ambi-ent and warm conditions through progeny development and F1 rearing, the warm conditioned line had greater thermal tolerance (Campbell et al. 2020), but a multigenerational study found that while warming had no effect on F1 development, it increased F2 brood number, with the magnitude of change depending on diet (Ledet et al. 2018).The prevalence of hypoxic areas in coastal waters is predicted to increase as a result of increased anthropogenic nutrient input and climate change (Bijma et al. 2013, Gobler & Hannes 2016). While many adult stages of estuarine invertebrates can cope with short periods of hypoxia, it is unclear if animals bred and reared in such conditions have this ability. Experiments using the estuarine amphipod Gammarus chevreuxi found that moderate hypoxia has markedly different effects as to whether adults exposed to short-term hypoxia or if they undergo their whole development under these conditions (Truebano et al. 2018). If these results are transferable to other estuarine species which are currently considered as hypoxia tolerant and given that hypoxia is predicted to occur frequently in coastal waters, this may have significant impact on the resilience of these animals which play an important role in estuarine ecosystems. Subsequent studies by Collins et al. (2022) investigated whether thermal acclimatisation impacted the ability of coastal amphipods to with-stand hypoxia. Four closely related amphipod species were subjected to different temperatures and the species varied in their responses to temperature and hypoxia. Such studies using more than one stressor are critical in understanding how amphipods will react to changing conditions.Transgenerational responses of copepods to acidification have been found to be highly spe-cies specific (Lee et al. 2020). Transgenerational studies of OA report decreased hatching success and offspring development in Acartia bifilosa and Acartia tonsa (Cripps et al. 2014). However, after 80 generations (3.5 years), beneficial acclimation responses to OA were not observed in A. tonsa (Langer et al. 2019) leaving behind a legacy of reduced developmental rate but not hatching 48PAULINE M. ROSS ET AL.success. In Acartia sp., there was a positive transgenerational response from parents to offspring within a generation with significantly increased antioxidant capacity which mitigated biochemi-cal damage caused by acidification and ultimately increased reproductive output (Vehmaa et al. 2016). Most recently, a study on the TGP over 25 generations of A. tonsa exposed to OW and OA found decreased thermal performance (deMayo et al. 2021). For Pseudocalanus acuspes, multi-generational exposure to acidification resulted in decreased fecundity in the F2 and reduced gene expression, including downregulation of RNA transcription genes (Thor & Dupont 2015, De Wit et al. 2016). For Calanus finmarchius, the effect of OA on development of the F1 depended on acidi-fication level (Pedersen et al. 2014).Benthic copepods like Tigriopus californicus have shown little or no capacity for transgen-erational acclimation and/or adaptation to warming even after 10 generations (Kelly et al. 2012). The lack of adaptive capacity may be explained by the low genetic diversity and poor acclamatory capacity associated with living in extreme habitats such as high intertidal areas (Somero 2010, Kelly et al. 2012, 2016). For Tigriopus japonicus, OA had no effect on hatching in a transgenerational study (Kita et al. 2013) or on embryo survival and larval production in a multigenerational study (Li et al. 2017). Recently, negative transgenerational effects of acidification in the harpacticoid copepod, T. japonicus, have found that glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase may be partially responsible for decreased reproduction (Lee et al. 2019). In another benthic copepod, Tisbe battagliai, exposure to OA conditions in F3 resulted in negative effects on larval size and produc-tion as well as changes to the exoskeleton (Fitzer et al. 2012). A later study by Fitzer et al. (2013) again using Tisbe battagliai investigated their response to elevated pCO2 and environmental cop-per over two generations. They found that ocean acidification will enhance copper bioavailability resulting in larger but less fecund individuals, which may have an overall detrimental impact on copepod populations, an  integral component of meiofaunal communities.Parents of a shore crab exposed to warming mitigated the negative effects of other stressor (i.e., salinity) on the next-generation offspring, but such positive carry-over effect was highly variable (Torres et al. 2020).Sessile barnacles are largely unaffected by OA and/or OW (McDonald et al. 2009, Pansch et al. 2012, Nardone et al. 2018, Campanati et al. 2016). In the subtidal barnacle Striatobalanus amaryllis and the intertidal barnacle Amphibalanus amphitrite, there was a positive transgenera-tional response to warming within two generations; however, the survival and acclimation response decreased in F2 compared to F1 (Morley et al. 2017).CoralsIt is widely accepted that anthropogenic impacts, particularly global warming and OA, are two of the greatest threats to the future of coral reefs (Hughes et al. 2018, Perry & Alvarez-Filip 2019, Woodhead et al. 2019). Water temperatures that are only 1\u20132\u00b0C above normal summer maxima result in mass coral bleaching and extensive mortality (Ainsworth & Brown, 2021). Evidence also suggests that temperature and CO2 interact synergistically to increase the rate and severity of coral bleaching on reefs (Veron et al. 2009, Anthony et al. 2011, Putnam et al. 2017). The resilience of corals and coral reefs to climate change impacts depends on the responses of both the coral animal (host) and its endosymbiotic dinoflagellate partner (Ainsworth et al. 2010). Understanding the capacity, benefits and costs, of phenotypic plasticity through acclimation, acclimatisation, and adaptation of the symbiosis is a critical aspect in understanding resilience (Putnam et al. 2012). A recent review by Brown and Barott (2022) highlights the need to obtain a far better understanding of the acclimatisation versus sensitivity trajectories of a wide range of coral species to identify whether changes in bleaching susceptibility are related to physiological acclimatisation and/or trade-offs with other biological processes.49SURVIVING THE ANTHROPOCENEThe acclimatory potential of corals to OA varies substantially among different Scleractinia growth forms. In some examples, branching corals exposed to lower pH have been shown to increase skeletal macro-porosity and growth by linear extension at the potential cost of weaker skeletal structures and increased fragility (Tambutt\u00e9 et al. 2015). In contrast, for slower grow-ing mound-form coral species, OA has been linked to a decrease in calcification rates (Crook et al. 2013) and is unlikely to overcome the impacts of local OA. Putnam et al. (2020) investigated two distinct coral species, \u2018sensitive\u2019 Pocilliopora damicornis and \u2018robust\u2019 Montipora capitata, experimentally exposed to a gradient of pH conditions. The environmentally resistant montiporid corals were found to either acclimate quickly or be buffered from the impacts of lowered pH, with no differences found in metabolic performance, DNA methylation, or calcification. In contrast, Putnam et al. (2020) found reduced calcification and changes to metabolic performance and DNA methylation in the more sensitive coral P. damicornis. As such, the authors concluded OA trig-gers phenotypic plasticity in corals potentially driven by DNA methylation in susceptible species and linked to plasticity in the juveniles. Jury & Toonen (2019) found that three coral species from Kaneohe Bay (Hawaii), which are naturally subjected to decreased pH and high temperatures, were more resilient to acidification and OW than conspecifics from a nearby control site, indicating the potential for corals to adapt to their environmental conditions. Similarly, Stylophora pistillata from the Gulf of Aqaba (Red Sea) are resilient to projected OA conditions (Bellworthy et al. 2019a,b).There is some evidence to suggest that transgenerational tolerance to acidifying ocean conditions can occur in some coral species (Liew et al. 2018). In fact, Putnam et al. (2020) suggest that corals with the larval brooding life history have the most potential for transgenerational changes in toler-ance to OA. Liew et al. (2020) challenge the concept that inheritance of phenotypic traits is solely via genetic means. They found that the inheritance of DNA methylation patterns provides a potential pathway for environmentally induced phenotypes which can contribute to evolution of species and populations. This suggests that there is a significant role of DNA methylation in intergenerational inheritance of traits in corals, which may enhance their capacity to adapt to climate change.The capacity of corals for asexual reproduction and the spread of genotypes within a reef habitat through asexual reproduction is also a consideration in the success of adaption and acclimatisation (Willis et al. 2006). Recent studies further highlight the importance of the rate of change and the variance of exposure on the capacity for coral species to adjust performance while maintaining skeletal growth (Perry & Alvarez-Filip 2019).As rapid coral growth (skeletal extension) is reflective of the success of the coral endosymbiosis, it is also important to consider the impacts of OA on the coral meta-organism given the documented impacts of OA to coral growth (Van Oppen et al. 2015, Putnam et al. 2017). Impacts to skeletal structure and function emerge as the most widely occurring alterations caused by OA, which are likely to be a challenge for acclimatisation and adaption to overcome when combined with the impacts of rising temperatures and storm intensity on coral reefs.OW-driven coral bleaching is considered the greatest threat to the long-term sustainability of coral reefs worldwide. Bleaching events are caused by sustained SST. Increases of just 1\u20132\u00b0C above long-term summertime averages and the response of the corals\u2019 endosymbiotic algae to warming define the bleaching response (Glynn 1993, Hoegh-Guldberg 1999). Ocean tempera-tures are predicted to rise approximately 1\u20132\u00b0C within this century, leading to near the now-realised near-annual mass coral bleaching events (Hoegh-Guldberg 1999, Parry et al. 2007). Over the past two decades, ocean temperatures have increased over 0.3\u00b0C on coral reefs and research has shown that a 0.5\u00b0C temperature increase is the difference between corals undergo-ing a survivable endosymbiosis breakdown and coral mortality (Fordyce et al. 2019, Leggat et al. 2019). As such, the coming decades are now considered the critical time for coral\u2019s capacity to acclimate and adapt to the impacts of OW (Hoegh-Guldberg 1999, Hughes et al. 2003, Palumbi et al. 2014).50PAULINE M. ROSS ET AL.Coral species are often categorised by traits such as thermal tolerance, with some species known to be tolerant to increased temperatures and other coral species known to be susceptible (Carturan et al. 2018, Zawada et al. 2019). The corals endosymbiotic dinoflagellate (Family Symbiodiniaceae) also influence host resilience; corals hosting endosymbiotic algae previously designated as clade D symbionts are more thermally tolerant, while those corals hosting populations dominated by endosymbionts of clade C are typically growing faster and highly susceptible to warming water (LaJeunesse et al. 2018, Stat et al. 2013, Wong et al. 2021).The dominant Symbiodiniaceae strain can radically influence the phenotype of the meta-organism, but there are trade-offs for the host coral and the symbiosis can be inflexible within some species thereby not conferring long-term resilience. The short generation time (3\u201310 days) of Symbiodiniaceae highlights the potential to increase their thermal tolerance in ecologically relevant time scales through acclimatisation and/or adaptation. However, the extent to which Symbiodiniaceae phylotypes can acclimatise or adapt and the potential flow-on effects on the stress tolerance, growth, and survival of the meta-organism are not well known. Experimental evo-lution approaches aim to determine if selection for resilient meta-organism structures and host phenotypes is possible (Torda et al. 2017). While there is some evidence that transgenerational adaptation, through DNA methylation, histone modification, or other mechanisms, can result in the rapid phenotypic acclimatisation of the coral host to temperature (Liew et al. 2020) and that Symbiodiniaceae in culture can increase their thermal maxima (Chakravarti & Van Oppen 2018), results using experimental adaptation in an intact holobiont have been mixed (Quigley et al. 2020a,b). Buerger et al. (2020) suggest that phenotypes seen in cultured algae may not produce similar tolerant phenotypes in the intact symbiosis.Growth and survival of reef building corals is influenced by their symbiotic algal partners (Symbiodinium spp.). Cunning et al. (2015) addressed this by studying Pocillopora damicornis with either thermally sensitive (clade C) or tolerant (clade D) symbionts at various temperatures over many weeks. While warming waters will negatively impact corals, the clade of symbionts may affect their growth, highlighting the need to better understand such genotype\u2013environment interactions.A transgenerational selection study investigated experimentally induced thermal tolerance in thermally sensitive endosymbionts, Cladocium goreaui, and it was found that heat tolerance had improved, but coral growth and survival had not (Quigley et al. 2021). Other studies of experi-mental evolution of Symbiodiniaceae have found that species can show signs of both improved thermal tolerance and capacity to confer improved thermal tolerance to the host coral (Buerger et al. 2020). Due to the long generation time of the coral host, studies have yet to determine if experimental evolution of the meta-organism improves thermal tolerance and survival under bleaching conditions. A recent study using the model Aiptasia found that while plasticity to stress was possible in endosymbionts, there was no evidence for conferred resilience, through symbiont exchange (Herrera et al. 2020), suggesting that there may potentially be species-specific limita-tions to organism adaptation. Experimental approaches involving reciprocal transplantation of multiple genotypes have provided promising results, suggesting that both genotype and environ-ment selection are likely critical factors for the success of assisted acclimation and adaptation (Drury & Lirman 2021).OW and OA also interact synergistically to decrease thermal bleaching thresholds, and spe-cies-specific thermal tolerance also influences organism capacity to withstand the impacts of OA (Anthony et al. 2008). The complex interplay of OA and OW from a genetic to organismal level, as well as the rate and cumulative environmental changes, is therefore a key factor in determining the ability of different coral species, and ultimately coral reefs, to be resilient under future climate scenarios.51SURVIVING THE ANTHROPOCENEMarine fishIn general, fish are found to be relatively tolerant to CO2 levels expected by the end of the century, due to their well-developed capacity for acid\u2013base regulation (Brauner et al. 2019). The sensitivity of marine fish to OA is varied, with differences observed between species that are closely related or spe-cies that co-exist in particular habitats, as well as diversity in sensitivity between life stages within a species (Cattanoo et al. 2018, Munday et al. 2019). In some instances, the effects of elevated CO2 have been positive, with enhancement of reproductive capacity at 584\u20131023 \u00b5atm for the cinnamon clownfish (Miller et al. 2012). The strongest negative results have been observed during early life when acid\u2013base regulation is not well developed (Ishimatsu et al. 2005), as well as on anti-predator response and behaviour (Munday et al. 2009, Dixson et al. 2010, Cripps et al. 2011). Consequently, these traits are commonly the focus of research into acclimation and adaptation (Table S1).There is high capacity for phenotypic plasticity of physical traits to elevated CO2 within only a few generations. Specifically, the negative effects on early development and survival have been restored with parental or multigenerational exposure in a number of species (see Table S1, e.g., Menidia menidia, Amphiprion melanopus, and Gadus morhua). In these studies, the exposure of adults during reproductive windows results in offspring that have enhanced or restored performance (e.g., growth, survival) in the same elevated CO2 conditions. There are some cases where parental exposure has amplified the negative effects of CO2 on offspring (Schade et al. 2014), not all traits measured have been restored (McMahon et al. 2019), or beneficial parental effects have been offset when developing with limited food (Stiasny et al. 2018). In contrast to the high plasticity of physi-cal traits, there is limited evidence of acclimation in behaviour to OA (Welch et al. 2014, Welch & Munday 2017, McMahon et al. 2018). In cases where early life (Lopes et al. 2016) or parental expo-sure (Allan et al. 2014) has induced acclimation, only partial restoration has occurred. The limited rapid plasticity may be due to acid\u2013base regulation causing interference with neuroreceptors like the GABA-A receptor (Nilsson et al. 2012, Lopes et al. 2016). It should be noted that CO2 plasticity research has yet to rear parental fish for entire generations (only adults for 6 months to 1 year), which may be required to induce multigenerational plasticity (Donelson et al. 2018).Disparity in acclimation capacity of physical versus behavioural traits may be due to the genetic control and heritability of CO2 sensitivity (Malvezzi et al. 2015, Welch & Munday 2017, Tasoff & Johnson 2019). The few studies that have explored heritable transmission of phenotypes across gen-erations have found low to moderate levels for physical traits (mortality/survival h2: ~0.2, growth h2: ~0.1), but high heritability for behavioural traits (anti-predator response h2: ~0.6) (Table S1). It is often found that traits under selection in nature are not highly plastic. In most cases, heritability did not change with CO2 exposure, except for the highly heritable anti-predator responses of the spiny chromis coral reef fish, which under elevated 754 \u00b5atm CO2 heritability was lost (Welch & Munday 2017). The mechanism for transmission of anti-predator responses in this species has been linked to expression of circadian rhythm genes (Schunter et al. 2016).The ectothermic nature of fish means that physiological performance and cellular function is inherently linked with changes in environmental temperature (Fry 1971, Huey & Kingsolver 1989). Consequently, there has been a wealth of research over the years exploring the thermal sensitivity of marine fish (e.g., Roessig et al. 2004, Munday et al. 2008, Pankhurst & Munday 2011), which has led to generalisations at the ecosystem or latitudinal level. As with terrestrial ectotherms (Tewksbury et al. 2008), a consistent pattern of tolerance matching the historical range and variation in envi-ronmental temperatures experienced by a species or population is observed in marine fish, making tropical and polar species more sensitive to projected OW than temperate species (Comte & Olden 2017, Stuart-Smith et al. 2017). However, historical environmental variation can also alter resilience to future climate change due to its effect on genetic diversity and the capacity for phenotypic plastic-ity (Scheiner 1993, Seebacher et al. 2005).52PAULINE M. ROSS ET AL.Within-generation thermal acclimation capacity in temperate and polar species is generally high, with acclimation possible with relatively short exposure lengths (e.g., days to weeks) and the flexible timing of thermal exposure within a life cycle (Table S1). Rapid acclimation has been observed in traits including growth (Mascar\u00f3 et al. 2019), cardiovascular and metabolic physiology (Healy & Schulte 2012a, Safi et al. 2019), escape performance, and swimming ability (Temple & Johnston 1998). Comparatively, tropical marine fish seem to require longer exposure (i.e. months to year(s)) and/or exposure during early life (i.e., developmental plasticity, Nilsson et al. 2009, 2010, Donelson et al. 2011). In addition, within-generation thermal acclimation in tropical species often only partially compensates negative thermal effects (Donelson et al. 2011) and does not occur at all thermal exposures (Grenchik et al. 2012). In some cases, thermal exposure produces greater impacts on performance than acute thermal testing (barramundi: Norin et al. 2014, wrasses: Motson & Donelson 2017).The most common trait tested across species has been critical thermal maximum, perhaps in part due to ease of measuring. Critical thermal maximum also shows a similar pattern, where the majority of temperate and polar species increase maximum tolerance similar to the rate of thermal change, but tropical species have limited plasticity (Table S1). Only Habary et al. (2017) found high capacity for the reef damselfish Chromis viridis to increase thermal maximum (~1\u00b0C per 2\u00b0C acclimation temperature increase). Comparisons of thermal maxima should be made cautiously, as uniform rates of change across studies are not employed, and in many cases, warm acclimated fish begin thermal testing from a higher starting temperature, thus making disentangling acclimation from starting temperature difficult. Whether critical thermal maxima are useful in predicting ther-mal resilience of fish, as other traits suffer many degrees below, is often questioned.Studies investigating multigenerational plasticity highlight the large potential role it will play in the resilience of marine fish to warming, as it generally enhanced or restored performance above what occurred from within-generation plasticity (Donelson & Munday 2012, Donelson et al. 2012). Yet it also highlights the complexity of predicting responses in nature, with varying results between rapid or increment warming (Donelson et al. 2016) and differences across experimental generations (Shama et al. 2014, 2016). In addition, research on the sheepshead minnow highlights that either exposure length or timing during parental reproductive cycle may be critical to induce TGP in offspring as beneficial effects were only observed with a 60-day exposure rather than a 30-day exposure (Salinas & Munch 2012).Technology developments have allowed exploration of the potential underlying genomic mecha-nisms driving within- and multigenerational thermal plasticity, which has largely been explored with transcriptomic analysis. Across the species studied so far, expression changes have been seen in genes involved in metabolism, mitochondrial activity, mitochondrial respiration, tissue development, tran-scriptional regulation, immune response, and stress response occurred in response to warming (Veilleux et al. 2015, Shama et al. 2016, Bernal et al. 2018). Differential methylation has also been explored and shifts in methylation of insulin response, energy homeostasis, mitochondrial activity, oxygen consump-tion, and angiogenesis genes were correlated to plasticity of aerobic capacity (Ryu et al. 2018).Far less research involving marine fish has focused on adaptation to OW, including understand-ing of local adaptation that may already exist in current populations as well as the capacity for adaptation to future change. This is likely in part due to the expectation that rapid climate change is occurring at a rate greater than selection and genetic adaptation to keep pace with for the majority of species (Chevin et al. 2010, Kopp & Matuszewski 2014). It is also likely to be linked to the challenges of studying adaptation in relatively long-lived species as it requires following numerous generations and ideally in situ where natural selection can occur. One such adaptation study, on Atlantic herring, has identified selection outlier loci that correlate with thermal and salinity environmental experi-ence (Limborg et al. 2012). In a few laboratory experiments, adaptation has been explored through establishing the heritability of beneficially plastic traits (Munday et al. 2017) and gene \u00d7 environment interactions (Munday et al. 2017, Shama 2017). When explored, it is consistently found that certain genetic or family lines can outsurvive or outperform others, providing the opportunity for adaptation 53SURVIVING THE ANTHROPOCENEin nature (Munday et al. 2017, 2019, Shama 2017, Zanuzzo et al. 2019). More research into under-standing the interplay between plasticity and adaptation is especially pertinent because the adaptive nature of beneficial phenotypic change is generally assumed rather than proven.Challenges to resilience of marine animalsConsidering the relatively recent emergence of OA, OW, and OD research, a lot has been done within a short time, although the impacts of increased temperature on marine animals have long been of interest (e.g., Review Byrne 2010). Challenges to resilience of marine animals in the Anthropocene are summarised below.Many molluscs species may be lost over the coming decades. Studies suggest that molluscs have a capacity for phenotypic plasticity through the process of TGP which has been the most studied resilience mechanism and appears to ameliorate at least partially some of the negative effects of OA (Figure 1). How TGP responses will differ across populations and habitats, the longevity of TGP responses and the mechanisms underlying them and whether they come with trade-offs requires further investigation. Adaptation of molluscs via the selection of tolerant geno-types appears to be possible. This is based on a limited number of species, making it difficult to predict whether tolerant genotypes will be sufficient to prevent losses of mollusc populations and aquaculture industries. Selection of tolerant genotypes will likely be important to enhance food security and maintain economic benefits. Our understanding of the impacts of increase tempera-ture on molluscs in the context of global change is poor, especially for populations living close to their thermal limit where resilience capacity may be reached.

ROSS ET AL.needed to understand the resilience response of molluscs to multiple stressors, i.e., OA, OW, and OD combined (Keppel et al. 2016).For echinoderms, while adaptive capacity and protective mechanisms have been much dis-cussed, they remain to be demonstrated. Overall, many TGP studies on echinoderms show the importance of gamete development over the complete gametogenic cycle so that gonads fully develop and mature under experimental conditions, and this is likely to be associated with imprinting of the germ line (Byrne et al. 2020). The weight of evidence indicates that the effects on offspring depend on the OA and OW level and the duration of adult conditioning. It appears that phenotypic plasticity has some potential to mitigate the effects of changing climate on offspring fitness, but it is unknown if the beneficial traits can be maintained over generations. However, negative TGP to OA and OW were evident in many species. Some studies of sea urchins from upwelling and vent habitats indicate the presence of genetic variation in stress response mechanisms, the type of variation upon which selection operates. The presence of sea urchins that thrive under low pH sites or warm range edge conditions indicates considerable phenotypic plasticity and individuals with resilient genotypes. The impacts of OD and freshening on echinoderms in the context of global change (see Sato et al. 2018, Clements et al. 2022) are far less understood, leaving important knowledge gaps to address.There have been very few studies on the phenotypic plasticity and adaptive capacity of poly-chaetes. Given that polychaetes have been around since the Cambrian and occupy all marine and estuarine habitats from soft bottom communities in the deep sea to the intertidal, they certainly have the capacity to adapt, but how quickly they can do this is unknown. Polychaetes exhibit a range of feeding habits and play an important role in the bottom of food chain with lifespans from a few weeks to years. So, while abundant as shown in Table S1, few species have been studied from only five families, including some invasive species.This is regrettable given the positioning of polychaetes at the base of the food chain. Changes in species composition and abundance will almost certainly have flow-on effects on food chains in terms of the breakdown of organic matter and for those species which feed on polychaetes in the benthos and in the water column above. As many species can easily be maintained in the laboratory, they are good candidates for studying their adaptive capacity and their tolerance limits. Crustaceans unlike other marine organisms appear to have resilience, and the challenge of OA and OW is associ-ated with physiological trade-offs.Coral reefs have served as a model system for marine resilience being an ecosystem in crisis and at risk of being permanently lost. A range of human activities are threatening their capacity for persistence (Hughes et al. 2018). Hughes et al. (2010) outline that resilience of coral reefs is defined by non-linear (threshold) dynamics in response to slow and fast stressors which drive change, alter-nate persistent phases, reinforcing feedbacks, and hysteresis. TGP studies suggest that corals have the capacity to improve their resilience to OA, although this resilience appears to be species specific with some species more vulnerable than others. Understanding the capacity, benefits and costs, of plastic-ity, acclimation/acclimatisation, and adaptation of the symbiosis is a critical aspect in understanding resilience (Putnam et al. 2012). Other alliances such as coral chimerism (Rinkevich 2019) are largely understudied. The question of whether they will have resilience to the combined stressors of OA and OW and do this fast enough remains, given that so many corals are already living close to their thermal maxima and how climate change will interact to increase susceptibility of corals to disease (Maynard et al. 2015, Peixoto et al. 2017). Answering the fundamental questions of resilience and how corals and diverse coral reef ecosystems may acclimatise and adapt to OA and OW therefore requires an understanding of the genetic capability of potentially hundreds of habitat forming coral species and their meta-organism structure. Studies have also suggested that there will be a need to move beyond coral reef ecological theory to include human and socioeconomic and cultural processes if we are to successfully conserve corals in the Anthropocene, a time of rapid change (Williams et al. 2019).For marine fish, at first glance, future resilience is looking relatively robust. Generally, there is good capacity for both acclimation and adaptation producing improved performance (Figures 1 55SURVIVING THE ANTHROPOCENEand 2). This perspective of high resilience in fish results from research on smaller bodied species that are amenable to experimental research and traits that are easily measured (Figure 2, Table S1). There is concern that resilience of aerobic physiology and critical thermal maximum may not translate to growth (Grans et al. 2014) and reproductive capacity (Donelson et al. 2016). Research so far has allowed us to understand the fundamentals of acclimation, adaptation, and even under-lying genomic mechanisms (Table S1). However, for most of humanity, the main concern is the resilience of fishes that provide food security and livelihoods, for which there is a significant lack of knowledge. While a relatively large body of research compared to other marine taxa has been conducted (Figure 1), it still presents some limitations when predicting future resilience. First, there is a limited understanding of how the combination of OA and OW or OD will affect the resilience of marine fish. What we know from acute effects of these combined stressors (i.e., not testing for accli-mation and adaptation) is that we often cannot effectively predict a multistressor response from the OAOAChromis viridis  Choerodon rubescens Centropristis striata  Bathygobius soporator Amphiprion ocellaris  Amphiprion akallopisosCyprinodon variegatus Coryphoblennius galerita Halichoeres miniatus  Halichoeres melanurus  Gobionotothen gibberifronsLates calcarifer  Hippocampus erectusLycodichthys dearborniOstorhinchus doederleinPleuronectes platessa  Parablennius marmoreus Pogonicluhys macroepidotllsPremnas biaculeatus Pomatoschistus microps Solea solea  Seriola lalandi  Scartella cristataTaurulus bubalisTrematomus hansoni  Thalassoma amblycephalumClupea harengus Trematomus pennelliiGadus morhua  Pomacentrus moluccensis  Myoxocephalus scorpius  Trematomus bernacchii  Pomacentrus amboinensis  Pachycara brachycephalum  Notothenia rossii  Notothenia coriiceps  Forsterygion lapillumGillichthys mirabilis Fundulus heteroclitus  Pagothenia borchgrevinki  Gasterosteus aculeatusAcanthochromis polyacanthusPomacentrus wardi  Plectropomus leopardus  Leuresthes tenuisSciaenops ocellatus Sebastes spp.  Scorpaenichthys marmoratusAtherina presbyter  Amphiprion perculaGadus morhua  Menidia menidia  Notothenia rossiiGasterosteus aculeatusAmphiprion melanopusAbudefduf saxatilis  Acanthochromis polyacanthusTrematomus bernacchii  Notothenia rossii  Seriola lalandiMechanismAcclimationAdaptationFigure 2 Number of studies that have investigated the resilience of marine fish to Ocean Warming (OW), Ocean Acidification (OA) or Ocean Warming and Ocean Acidification (OW + OA).

ROSS ET AL.individual single stressors (Nowicki et al. 2012, Ferrari et al. 2014, Sswat et al. 2018). Furthermore, all combination stressor studies on resilience employ a joint change in both temperature and CO2. However, with the continued occurrence of MHWs (Oliver et al. 2018), a sequential experience of temperature followed by CO2 may be more realistic, but we lack an understanding of how this may shift the phenotypic plastic and adaptive responses. Another potential limitation is that while there is a wealth of experimental studies on plasticity, they have rarely been conducted to allow heritabil-ity and selection to be incorporated. As such, we cannot be sure that rapid resilience achieved in the laboratory will play out in nature once ecological processes take place (e.g., predation, competi-tion, sexual selection). It is also worth noting that many fishes rely on habitat forming organisms like corals for survival or other taxonomic groups for food (Coker et al. 2014, Abrantes et al. 2015, Froehlich et al. 2022), and thus, the resilience of fishes cannot be considered in isolation.One significant unanswered question is whether phenotypic plasticity of marine animals will be rapid enough to cope with the pace of anticipated climate change. For example, experi-ments repeating a study carried out 100 years previously have shown that an intertidal flatworm Procerodes littoralis has been able to undertake microevolution enabling them to adapt physi-ologically to changes in salinity over a 100-year period. Experiments conducted in 1914 were repeated in 2016 and 2017 to compare regeneration over a range of salinities (Clayton & Spicer 2020). These authors found that regeneration occurred over a wide range of salinities, whereas they had an optimum salinity (Salinity = 25) in 1914. During these 100 years+, rainfall has increased and the species is subjected more often to freshwater as well as full strength seawater during the tidal cycle. This suggests that P. littoralis has the physiological capacity of these animals to heal themselves at low salinities and is adapted to living in hyposaline waters as well as being able to heal in these salinities.Although not an animal, studies have investigated the ability of diatoms, which contribute about 20% of global primary production, to adapt to global warming (Schaum et al. 2018) studies. Schaum et al. (2018) found that the marine diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana could adapt to rising water tem-perature if temperature increases slowly over time or where they fluctuate between benign and severe conditions, but have far less ability if the increases are rapid. They exhibit both major genomic and phenotypic plastic changes. They further suggest that carbon-use efficiency (CUE) in the warm-adapted lineages arise due to differences in temperature sensitivities of photosynthesis and respiration which are highly conserved metabolic highways and may be this could be universal across a broad diversity of phytoplankton. This will also assist in projecting marine primary productivity in the future.Knowledge gaps/research needsMeasuring resilience is a challenge because it requires controlled, ecologically and temporally rel-evant experiments that commensurate with the pace of projected changes. With gradual stressor introduction over longer experimental durations, the potential and limitations of adaptive capacity are becoming clearer.Mechanisms of resilience require further investigation. So far, evidence suggests anticipatory changes in gamete development, particularly maternal effects through loading of cellular defences into the eggs such as heat shock chaperone proteins and epigenetic changes (Hamdoun & Epel 2007, Kanndorp et al. 2018, Eir\u00edn-L\u00f3pez & Putnam 2019, Byrne et al. 2020). Transcriptomic changes have also been found and believed to alleviate the effects of apoptosis through cell cycle regulation (Goncalves et al. 2017).Our knowledge of the resilience of marine animals to climate change is focused on certain model species because of existing genetic understanding, simplicity of husbandry, a well-known life history, or proximity to research facilities, for example, fish such as Acanthochromis  polyacanthus and Fundulus heteroclitus (Figures 1\u20133). Also species like the oyster Saccostrea glomerata have been the focus of research for aquacultural and economic reasons (Figure 3).57SURVIVING THE ANTHROPOCENEIn summary, to date, we have limited understanding of the adaptive capacity and resilience of marine animals for several reasons.First, most studies have done multiple studies on the same model species which are easily manipulated in the laboratory. While this comes with the benefits of species which can be eas-ily kept in the laboratory for extended periods of time without significant mortality at multiple stages of their life history, it also creates a lack of broad representation of species responses in most groups and may not represent what is happening in the field or environment. The arguments about collapsing acclimation with acclimatisation will not lead to an understanding of mechanisms and responses which may vary depending on laboratory versus field conditions. For example, in echinoderms, most studies are on sea urchins and sea stars. In molluscs, most studies are done on bivalve oysters. In polychaetes, most species studied are on invasive and intertidal species. Rather than switch species, researchers seek to build on previous findings. This provides a sound base of knowledge of resilience for some species at the cost of a broader understanding of resilience which is exacerbated by a publication bias towards strong and significant results (Yang et al. 2022). This is despite multiple studies outlining the species-specific nature of climate change responses (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2018).OAOWOW + OAArgopecten irradiansHaliotis rufescensLimacina helicinaMercenaria mercenariaMya arenariaMytilus chilensisMytilus galloprovincialisNucella lapillusCrassostrea hongkongensisCrassostrea virginicaMusculista senhousiaRuditapes philippinarumMytilus edulisSaccostrea glomerataChlorostoma funebratisCrassostrea ariakensisLittorina littoreaOstrea angasiPinctada maximuaSiphonaria australisSaccostrea glomerataOstrea luridaCrassostrea gigasSaccostrea glomerataMechanismAcclimationAdaptationFigure 3 Number of studies that have investigated the resilience of molluscs to Ocean Warming (OW), Ocean Acidification (OA) or Ocean Warming and Ocean Acidification (OW + OA). Shapes indicate the resil-ience mode, either acclimation (circle) or adaption (triangle).58PAULINE M. ROSS ET AL.It is clear that investigations need to be expanded to incorporate more species from a variety of habitats and a broader representation within each group. This is needed because without broad representation of species, predictions about whether marine animals will have sufficient adap-tive capacity and resilience is limited. A more deliberate and inclusive approach is also needed because most species tested so far, with the exception of oysters, are also not ones that human populations rely on for protein sources. Further, as many species studied to date are intertidal, they might have a more plastic response to environmental change and thus greater resilience; however, this might not be a representative response of those marine animals in more stable subtidal habitats.Increasing representation, however, has the challenges of funding. Studies that broaden representation may involve species which might not be as amenable to manipulative experi-ments and come with increased risk and costs. Due to the difficulties in maintaining some groups of animals in the laboratory under experimental conditions, there is also a lack of mul-tigenerational studies. Groups such as crustaceans some of which have short life-history times and are amendable to laboratory experiments are an exception to this. It is difficult, however, to extrapolate the findings from studies on crustaceans to other marine animals with calcium carbonate shells. Further, even when species are kept in the lab for multiple generations, in the case of one targeted polychaete species, they are fed on spinach, and this has no resemblance to what happens in the real world.Second, our understanding of the resilience of marine animals to climate change is also lim-ited because studies are mainly restricted to the impacts of single or combined OA and OW rather than the impact of multistressors. There is a dominance of research on single, rather than multiple stressors (Figure 1). Of the 208 studies considered in this review, only 17 (8%) investigated the combined effects of elevated temperature and CO2. Unlike these experiments, however, OA and OW will not occur in isolation (Lee et al. 2021) and combine with other environmental factors such as OD (Gobler & Hannes 2016, Sampaio et al. 2021) and extreme events such as MHWs and HEs (Sampaio et al. 2021).More studies are needed which incorporate multiple stressors OA, OW, and OD including local-ised stressors such as water quality, salinity, harvesting, and pollution. Combined OA and OW stress-ors generally exhibited a stronger response (either positive or negative) effect (Harvey et al. 2013). Harvey et al. (2013) caution against  drawing conclusions from single stressor experiments and also predict increased likelihood of stressors interacting and intensifying in the future. Recent results suggest that the interactions of multiple stressors are even more concerning. For example, Sampaio et al. (2021) found that hypoxic events elicited consistent negative effects relative to control biological performance \u2013 survival (\u201333%), abundance (\u201365%), development (\u201351%), metabolism (\u201333%), growth (\u201324%), and reproduction (\u201339%) \u2013 across the taxonomic groups (molluscs, crustaceans, and fish), ontogenetic stages, and climate regions studied. Once again, the reason for the absence of multiple stressor studies is because of the difficulties of these experiments which require considerable upscal-ing and cost. The benefits of multiple stressor experiments are a more realistic understanding of resil-ience of marine animals which enable adaptive planning. Multiple stressor studies need to be balanced with the need to investigate responses of marine organisms to acute events such as heatwave stress with realistic experimental heatwave scenarios and freshwater incursions with rapid drops in salinity and HEs (Sampaio et al. 2021). The effects of MHWs are a knowledge gap and there is the potential for the induced selection to shift population phenotypic and genetic structure to either enhance or hinder adaptation. Heatwave events and greater precipitation will become more frequent with climate change, and we need to know how marine animals will respond to these events. Further research is needed on the multiple climate change stressors which impact the resilience of marine animals.59SURVIVING THE ANTHROPOCENEThird, there is also no consensus even within well studied groups, such as fish, as to what are the key traits that determine resilience. The predictions of resilience are potentially biased by the traits that are chosen to be studied and there is even contention around the measurement of some vari-ables such as cTmax in fish. This is a considerable challenge for the field because it is species and ecology specific. A solution to this and a way forward in resilience research is to create a guiding framework to allow enhanced comparative abilities. While concentrating research on select species can narrow our understanding of resilience, this can be alleviated with a trait-based approach for future research (Butt et al. 2022).Finally, there is a need to go beyond single species studies to be able to predict marine ecosys-tem responses \u2013 for instance, a focus on climate change impacts on ecological influential interac-tions such as predator\u2013prey relationships is required (Wright et al. 2014, 2018, Manr\u00edquez et al. 2021, McLaren & Byrne 2022). Since many of the investigated marine species are at the bottom of the food chain, their extinction may have major trophic flow-on effects.Conclusion/synopsisThis review has synthesised the literature on resilience to climate change of the main groups of marine animals. Marine animals are ecologically, economically, culturally, and aesthetically important, provide essential ecosystem services in coastal and estuarine environments, form the basis of aquaculture industries, and are a source of protein for humans across the globe. Whether marine animals will have the phenotypic plasticity and adaptive capacity to persist against multiple stressors remains unknown. Whether phenotypic plasticity will buy enough time for adaptation and evolutionary rescue and be fast enough to keep up with the rapid pace of climate change remains to be seen and a critical area of research (Byrne et al. 2020, Harmon & Pfennig 2021, Morgan et al. 2020). It is likely that for many marine animals, climate change will breach thresholds and create a tipping point in their resilience.Data availability statementThe data that support the findings of this study are available in the supplementary material of this\u00a0article.ReferencesAbrantes, K.G., Barnett, A., Baker, R. & Sheaves, M. 2015.

Keywords:\tDrosophila subobscura,\tchromosome\tinversion,\tadaptation,\tnatural\tselection,\tclimate\tchange.n GENETICS\tAND\tCLIMATE\tCHANGELiving beings have the ability to adapt to environmental change. Adaptations are nothing more than characteristics of an organism that allow it to survive and reproduce. In order for this adaptive capacity to be useful, it must be able to move down generations, i.e. it needs to be hereditary. This is why genetics is so important when explaining how species face the challenge of an environmental deviation with such a reach and intensity as climate change; genomes are large reservoirs of genetic variability from which organisms can draw their adaptations and thus potentially avoid disappearing. The current climate change process is a great opportunity for research, because we can learn a lot about the genetic mechanisms behind the adaptation of species. These studies can be done by collecting samples of the same species over time or in different geographical locations (colder or warmer ones, for instance) to observe differences in certain genes or genetic markers. With the information from observations in nature, laboratory experiments can be designed to simulate particular climate conditions (usually via temperature changes) and to analyse whether organisms manifest the same reactions related to the same genes or genetic markers. These results can offer information on the genetic basis of adaptive mechanisms, in this case, to climate change. Currently, thanks to so-called \u00abancient DNA\u00bb techniques, we can even analyse genome fragments from fossils of extinct species alongside contemporary species and analyse which of these genome pieces might be key to climate adaptations. We must not forget that the adaptation of an organism does not depend on it having one variant of a gene or another; it depends on the mechanisms regulating these genes. Information regarding gene expression is very valuable because it can help us to foresee the adaptation (or lack thereof) of populations of organisms to the environmental changes derived from global warming. Genetics can also be very useful from a more practical point of view. If we know which individuals \u00abADAPTATIONS ARE CHARACTERISTICS OF AN ORGANISM\u2019S DESIGN THAT ALLOW IT TO SURVIVE AND REPRODUCE. IN ORDER FOR IT TO BE USEFUL, IT MUST BE HEREDITARY\u00bbM\u00e8tode48\t M\u00c8TODE|  DOCUMENT  |   How do organisms adapt to climate change?(or populations) present gene variants that grant them more survival opportunities in certain environmental conditions, we can reconstruct some environments that have become extremely degraded due to climate change. This approach has been applied to the reconstruction of several ecosystems in the United States (Wymore et al., 2014). The technique involves the genetic and ecological study of many organisms, from bacteria to plants and animals.In this text, we describe our research on the genetic mechanisms that allow species to adapt specifically to climate change. We use a type of fruit fly called Drosophila subobscura in which we study chromosomal inversions, i.e., chromosome fragments facing the direction opposite to the usual, as genetic markers.n\t THE\tSPECIES:\t\u2018DROSOPHILA\tSUBOBSCURA\u2019Drosophila subobscura, a fly from the Diptera order, is often used in genetics, especially in evolution studies (Figure 1). Its biogeographical distribution (Krimbas, 1993) covers most of Europe, except the central and northern part of Scandinavia and Iceland. In North Africa it can even be found in the Sahara desert and in the Middle East it is present in Iran. However, the area it occupies in the territories of the former Soviet Union is still largely unknown. It can also be found on Mediterranean islands, as well as in the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands. In 1978, its presence was described for the first time in Chile (Mestres, Balany\u00e0, Prevosti, & Serra, 1993) and it quickly spread west of the Andes, from La Serena to Punta Arenas, although its presence in the south of Chile is believed to be seasonal. Such colonisation probably comes from a Mediterranean population, but the exact origin is still unknown. A few years later, in 1982, it was found for the first time on the North-American west coast, from south California to the south of the Canadian state of British Columbia. We must also mention that a small colonising core was detected around the Argentinian city of Mar de Plata. Experts think it could be a secondary colonisation after the main one in Chile. All three regions currently occupied by the species are consistent. All of them have the same climate alternation: an oceanic and Mediterranean climate (up to the semi-arid pre-desert area). One of the main characteristics of D. subobscura is that it only has six polytene chromosomes, called A (X or sexual), J, U, E, O and dot. All of them, with the exception of the dot chromosome, present chromosomal inversions (Figure 2). As we have already mentioned, inversion is the substitution of a chromosome fragment facing the opposite direction to normal. In D. subobscura, the inversions have the names of letters (indicating the chromosome) and a number (identifying each inversion) or the \u00abst\u00bb symbol (for standard). A lot of times the same chromosome presents several inversions, forming what is known as an \u00abarrangement\u00bb. The different inversions forming the arrangements are identified by their numbers separated by the sign \u00ab+\u00bb. Finally, in order to show if the inversions completely or partially overlap, the numbers are underlined (for instance O3+4).

However, this fact is essential in evolutionary terms because genes in the inversion tend to be inherited together. If the gene combination that contains an inversion is favourable and allows it to adapt better to its environment (survive and reproduce), it will be favoured by natural selection and will increase in frequency over generations. That is why D. subobscura is such a successful model species in evolutionary studies.From the 1950s, different European research schools started to analyse inversions in natural populations of D. subobscura. Variation between populations, and even between samples from the same location, was identified. The biggest surprise to scientists was that some of the inversions changed with latitude, that is, they presented what experts call a cline. Thus, some inversions were very abundant in the south of Europe and decreased in frequency in northern samples (such as O3+4). On the other hand, other inversions were not abundant in the south but increased in frequency in northern populations (for example, Ost). There are two possible explanations for this phenomenon: either the involvement of a historical process or because of the adaptive value of the inversions. In the first scenario an inversion would have appeared at a particular moment (several different mechanisms can generate them, though we will not discuss them in this article) which became very abundant in the population where it appeared. With the natural movement of the Drosophilae, the inversion would have spread passively throughout Europe, thus showing a gradient. Of course, the farther the population spreads from its origin, the less often the inversion would appear. In the second scenario a new inversion that provides an advantage to the specimens that have it would have increased in frequency thanks to natural selection. If the advantage is an adaptation to climate conditions (mainly temperature and other factors linked to it), we would expect its abundance to depend on the position of populations along a north-south axis. For many years, experts discussed which of the two hypotheses explained the cline distribution of inversions in the species (Krimbas & Loukas, 1980). Until two colonised regions were found on the Americas (Chile and the west coast of the United States) which showed latitudinal clines for essentially the same inversions as in Europe, and in the same direction, which strongly supported the adaptive value of inversions (Prevosti et al., 1988). n\t CLIMATE\tCHANGE\tAND\tCHROMOSOMAL\tINVERSIONSMeteorological measurements imply that the temperature of our planet is increasing; the data indicate the planet has warmed by 0.6 \u00baC over the last three decades, and by 0.8 \u00baC compared to the last century (Hansen et al., 2006). Simultaneously, snow and ice seem to have decreased by about 10 %. Likely as a result of these changes, the pattern of rainfall has become more irregular.

Years later, the last thesis he supervised connected long-term changes in chromosomal inversions with temperature variations (Orengo & Prevosti, 1996), thus once again, highlighting how quickly natural selection acts on D. subobscura. This work was continued by Llu\u00eds Serra, who analysed the long-term variation of chromosomal inversions in this species, comparing old data with new for a broad collection of European (thirteen over at least fifteen years) and North and South American (thirteen in a eighteen-twenty year interval) populations. If the warming were global, the frequency of inversions would change according to climate change in both the European and American populations, even several years after the origin of the double colonisation. However, populations analysed in Europe and America usually presented long-term differences both in the type of inversions and in the frequency of \u00abwarmth-related\u00bb inversions gained over time (Balany\u00e0, Huey, Gilchrist, & Serra, 2009).n\t CHROMOSOMAL\tINVERSION\tSTUDIES\tIN\tSERBIAThis biogeographical region was important for different reasons. Why was Serbia a particularly important area for study? Most latitude clines historically studied for D. subobscura follow a southwest-northeast axis, starting from the Iberian Peninsula. Furthermore, although it cannot be firmly stated, a number of genetic tests have led scientists to believe that the origin of the American colonisation was a west Mediterranean population. Therefore, Serbia was studied to determine whether or not inversions also changed, and if they followed the predictions for global warming in a different European region where no latitude-cline or time variation studies had yet been carried out. The populations of D. subobscura in the Balkans contain chromosomal inversions that can be considered Mediterranean, but they are very different in some respects (type and frequency of some inversions) to what one can find in the western basin (Krimbas, 1993). Serbia, being part of the Balkans, is considered to have been the refuge for many species during the last glaciation, which makes it attractive in evolutionary terms, because it may have accumulated a lot of genetic variability. Helpfully, inversions have been extensively studied in the Serbian D. subobscura populations thanks to the school founded by Dragoslav Marinkovic, which means a lot of historical information on genetic inversions is available (for a good review, see Krimbas, 1993; Zivanovic, Andjelkovic, & Marinkovic, 2002).The first study of the series was done with samples from a population in Avala, 18 km away from Belgrade (Figure 3) and 450 m above sea level (Zivanovic & Mestres, 2010a). Collection was carried out during the month of September in 2003, 2004 and 2005.

This is also to be expected, because environmental conditions during the months before the collection determine the results for chromosomal inversions. We must not forget that many inversions are adaptive, not only with respect to temperature, but to other factors that may or may not be related to it. Seasonal changes were studied in another piece of work, directly related to the aforementioned one (Zivanovic & Mestres, 2010b); in particular, inversions from the same locations (Avala) in a June 2004 sample were compared to another sample from September of the same year, and according the results from other researchers changes in some inversions were also found (on chromosomes J, E and U). These findings encouraged us to follow this line of research. We chose the population in Apatin, a wetland area on the left side of the Danube, for the next study (Zivanovic & Mestres, 2011). It is a very stable habitat, which is relatively unaffected by human activity, and is ideal for the proposed research project. There was data about the chromosomes analysed in 1994 and new captures were made in 2008 and 2009. As previously mentioned, the first approach to analysing if chromosomal inversions change in line with an influence by climate change is studying whether \u00abwarmth-\u00bb and \u00abcold-related\u00bb inversions increase or decrease, respectively. Nonetheless, to be precise one must also study on-site temperature fluctuations over time. Luckily, we were able to obtain data about maximum, minimum and average temperatures, as well as the rainfall, thanks to the Hydrometeorological Service records obtained from the Republic of Serbia. These showed that the temperatures tended to increase, while the pattern of rainfall was irregular (another potential characteristic of climate change).

Later we studied the chromosomes of another population, both in terms of monthly variation (short term) and by comparing them to fifteen-year-old samples (long term). The Serbian population chosen was from Petnica (collected in 2010), about 100 km south of Belgrade (Zivanovic, Arenas, & Mestres, 2012), and the specimens were collected in a Carpinus betula forest. This work also aimed to carry out comparative analysis of the Serbian populations we had chromosomal inversion data for (a total of eighteen samples) using multivariate statistical methodology. Interestingly, we detected monthly changes in the chromosome composition of the samples which may be due to natural selection responding to environmental changes, but also to the fact that specimens may move around to look for the temperatures they prefer. As for long term studies, some \u00abwarmth-related\u00bb inversions which were not observed in the 1995 sample were detected for the first time in 2010 (U1+8+2, E1+2+9+12 and O3+4+8), and an increase in \u00abwarmth-related\u00bb inversions (A2, J1, U1+2 and O3+4) and decrease in \u00abcold-related\u00bb inversions (Ast, Jst, Ust, Est and Ost) was also again observed. One of the highlights of the work is that all of the temperatures studied (maximum, minimum and average) were found to have generally increased, with the most significant change being detected in the minimum temperature. Regarding the study of inversions in the Balkan populations as a whole, our cluster analysis grouped all of the \u00abold\u00bb inversions into one group and all of the \u00abrecent\u00bb inversions into another. Thus, again demonstrating that this genetic marker varies over time. Using inversion data and information about the climate characteristics of the populations, the first and second main components accounted for 67.27 % and 23.17 % of the total variation, respectively (Figure 4). What is interesting is that the first component explains differences between populations which are related to temperature and rainfall, in other words, it changes positively as we move to warmer and drier populations. Therefore, the composition of populations in terms of inversions is a natural selection response to climate change. Moreover, the variation moves in the direction we would expect if it were due to the effect of global warming on our planet.This field of study is fascinating and our intention is to continue these experiments and analyses, for example, by observing the effect of inversion combinations from the same homologous pair (karyotypes) or the interactions between chromosome inversions from different pairs. Indeed, our preliminary studies seem to indicate that inversions present more adaptive value than karyotypes (Zivanovic, Arenas, & Mestres, 2014). In short, chromosomal inversions are a good marker of climate change and, in addition, they allow us to study how species adapt to it.

    "abstract": "Phenotypic plasticity is the ability of an organism to alter its expressed phenotype in response to the environment in which it develops. There are many different environmental factors that can influence the phenotype of organisms such as photoperiod, temperature, mechanical strain, as well as nutrient availability (Stoehr and Goux 2008; Schneider et al. 2014). Adaptive plasticity allows organisms to cope with varying and complex environments and changing conditions. Along with these factors, the effects of changing environments caused from habitat alterations or climate change need to be studied more in depth. Understanding the ecology of plastic organisms is important for understanding range changes, especially with a changing climate. A model organism with already established patterns of phenotypic plasticity can be used to analyze differences in latitudes as well as changes that have occurred over past decades to ultimately lead to a study focusing on the long-term effects of global climate change. In order to study this effect, specific organisms need to be examined to extrapolate information to other organisms",

Environmental factors can cause organisms to developdifferent phenotypes that may increase survival or reproduction in a process known as\"adaptive phenotypic plasticity\" (West-Eberhard, 1989; Hughes, 2000). With phenotypicplasticity, organisms are able to cope with their highly variable surroundings. However,depending on the environmental factors, phenotypic plasticity could cause organisms tobecome adapted or maladapted to their surroundings. For example, plasticity could playarole in an intennediate form of speciation (Schneider et al., 2014) or it could createdelays in the evolutionary process of an organism (West-Eberhand, 1989). Whetheradapted or maladapted, with phenotypic plasticity organisms are able to developcompletely different phenotypes from the same set of genes. This helps the organismssurvive and reproduce in variable or changing environments, without necessarilyaccumulating mutations in their genome that allow the expressed phenotype to bemodified. The impact of plasticity on the organisms survival in nature needs to bestudied more in depth. This will help to understand the causes of the phenotypic changes,as well as the overall effect it has on species. Phenotypic plasticity is an important factorin the evolution of organisms and allows for selection of different gene expressions tocreate variation in phenotypes.Changing Views on Phenotypic PlasticityInitially, scientists viewed the expression of different phenotypes resulting frornplasticity as flaws in the genetic makeup of the organism. Many were afraid to1acknowledge observations of polymorph isms due to the fear of relating environmentalfactors to the polymorphisms, similar to the disproven theory of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck(West-Eberhard, 1989). However, the evidence implicating environmentally influencedphenotypic changes started to become more evident. Scientists realized that the changeswere not based upon use and disuse, but instead, upon the organisms reacting to theirenvirorunentwhile developing. Previously, different phenotypes were thought to besolely the result of genetic variation; only changes in this code were believed to result inthe evolution of the animal (West-Eberhard, 1989). However, phenotypic plasticityfocuses on gene expression as opposed to genetic variation itself. This change in geneexpression is becoming a greater focus in evolutionary ecology and can be studied byconcentrating on organisms that display different phenotypes resulting from changes intheir environments.Phenotypic Plasticity in NaturePhenotypic plasticity is the ability of an organism to express different phenotypesbased on the environment in which it develops. There are instances of phenotypicplasticity that occur due to alterations in the timing of various events, such as abbreviatedlarval growth, throughout development. This is known as heterochronic phenotypicplasticity (Haye, 2010). A specific example of this is the southeastern Pacific squatlobster, Pleuroncodes monodon. There are two different size phenotypes; however, evenwith the large difference in appearance, there is a lack of genetic diversity between thetwo sizes oflobsters (Haye, 2010). The northern pelagic form of the lobster is muchsmaller in size when it reaches maturity compared to the benthic southern form. The2cephalothoracic length of the southern form is on average 6mm larger than the northernform despite a complete lack of mitochondrial genetic differentiation between the twolobster forms (Haye, 2010). The phenotypic differences are believed to be caused fromeither differences in latitude, water depth, or oxygen concentrations of the water (Haye,2010). This example shows how delays during development brought on by an organismresponding to its environment allow it to express these different phenotypes.Adaptions to developmental environments can increase survival. For example,Daphnia respond to chemicals given offby surrounding predators by changing theirexpressed phenotype to produce a helmet-like structure to provide protection for theirheads (Gilbert, 2001). This permanent structure allows Daphnia to have a better chanceof survival when faced with the looming danger of predators. Even though this plasticitycan help fend off threats, there is a trade-off with reproductive capabilities (Gilbert.,2001). When this helmet is expressed, Daphnia are unable to reproduce as quickly aswhen the helmet is not expressed, due to devoting a high quantity of resources to developthe helmet structure. Interestingly, Daphnia that develop the helmet structures can alsoproduce offspring with the protecti ve phenotype (Gilbert, 2001). This shows that thephenotypes produced from the reactive genornes are not only affecting a singlegeneration, they are also capable of being passed on to offspring via a heritable process.This could point to an epigenetic change with the reactive genornes. Epigenetic changescould benefit organisms that experience variable environments.3Global Warming Poses Need/or Fast ChangesThe ecological and evolutionary significance of phenotypic plasticity is seen in lightof past and continuing climate change. Given that climate change may have both direct(e.g. temperature) and indirect (e.g. changes in food availability) effects on organisms, itis hard to predict the net effects of climate change without considering phenotypicplasticity. Increasing greenhouse gases have already caused small overall changes to theearth's atmosphere (Parmesan, 2007). The current rate of climate change is rapid enoughthat for some organisms, adaptive evolutionary change may be impossible and could leadto extinction. However, phenotypic plasticity may allow certain organisms to survivewithout evolving new phenotypes. This ability to express different phenotypes in order toacclimate to the quickly changing global temperatures, as well as other environmentalfactors, is extremely helpful to many organisms. Phenotypic plasticity could be theanswer many of these organisms need to survive the continuous changes. Ifwe are betterable to understand the factors that are necessary to achieve this phenotypic plasticity., aswell as what organisms are able to utilize it, then we can further understand the effectsclimate change will have on species.The Model OrganismBecause they are conspicuous and wide-spread, butterflies are widely studied in thecontext of the ecology of climate change. With increases in global temperatures.scientists have shown that the butterflies are appearing earlier in spring (Roy and Sparks,2000). This has an effect on agricultural practices due to the butterflies feeding on theplant life. Studies have shown that habitat ranges ofbuttertlies are expanding due to4milder climates being created from global warming (Parmesan and Yohe, 2003; Roy andSparks, 2000). Specifically, the range boundaries of some species are moving northwardat an average of6 kilometers each decade since the earth's temperature started rising(Parmesan, 2003). Additionally, certain butterflies have expanded their ranges to higherelevations where their survival rate has increased (Hughes, 2000). If the butterflies areable to continue expanding their boundaries, more and more areas will have theiragricultural practices influenced by the butterfly populations. In order for the butterfliesto successfully expand their areas of existence, they need to undergo phenotypic changesthat allow them to live in these new environments, and phenotypic plasticity is likely toplaya role. The cabbage white butterfly, Pieris rapae, in particular is an ideal modelorganism for an ecological investigation of phenotypic plasticity because it displays apredictable and quantifiable form of phenotypic plasticity (Stoehr and Goux, 2008). Thewing color patterns of this organism are affected by environmental parameters includingtemperature and photoperiod (Stoehr, 2010).5Wing color variation in the cabbage white butterfly (Pieris rapae): usingmuseum collections to examine broad-scale patternsIntroductionPhenotypic plasticity is the ability of an organism to alter its expressed phenotypein response to the environment in which it develops. There are many differentenvironmental factors that can influence the phenotype of organisms such as photoperiod,temperature, mechanical strain, as well as nutrient availability (Stoehr and Goux 2008;Schneider et al. 2014). Adaptive plasticity allows organisms to cope with varying andcomplex environments and changing conditions. Along with these factors, the effects ofchanging environments caused [rOITIhabitat alterations or climate change need to bestudied more in depth. Understanding the ecology of plastic organisms is important forunderstanding range changes, especially with a changing climate. A model organism withalready established patterns of phenotypic plasticity can be used to analyze di fferences inlatitudes as well as changes that have occurred over past decades to ultimately lead to astudy focusing on the long-tenn effects of global climate change. In order to study thiseffect, specific organisllls need to be examined to extrapolate information to otherorganisms,This study focused on a model organism, the cabbage white butterfly (Pierisrapae). This species has well-established patterns of phenotypic plasticity that make it anideal organism for studying the environmental factors that cause plasticity. The cabbagewhite increases or decreases the melanin content in its wings in response to thephotoperiod and temperature it is exposed to during the larval and pupal stages (Stoehr,2010). When maturing in short photoperiods and colder temperatures, the cabbage whitewill express a higher quantity of melanin in its ventral hindwing as well as on the basal6portion of the dorsal forewing, i.e. the area making up the discal wing cell (Figure 1).These are the areas on the butterflies' wings where increases in melanin content will helpto absorb solar energy when basking (Ellers and Boggs, 2003). This change in melanincan be explained by the butterfly's need to thermoregulate. Because butterflies areectotherms, they must derive the heat for their body from the environment. Their abilityto fly is affected by their body temperature. The butterfly must reach temperatures above35\u00b0C to have the capability to fly (Kingsolver et al., 2011). There is a clear connectionbetween the butterflies' melanin content in their wings and their ability tothennoregulate. Stoehr and Goux (2008) showed that southern California cabbage whitebutterfly wing patterns change seasonally, with clear differences in the degree of wingmelanization (black vs. white wing scales) of butterflies captured in the spring comparedto those captured in the summer. Summer butterflies had more melanization in wingclements, sexually dimorphic spots and apex, while spring butterflies had lessmelanization of wing clements. For the diffuse melanization found in the discal area aswell as the ventral hindwing, more rnelanization was seen in spring caught butterflies.With these known expressions of phenotypic plasticity in the cabbage white,historical environmental changes can be studied. Over many years, the average globaltemperature has been increasing at a steady rate due to increased use offossil fuels(Parmesan, 2007). These changes can influence the ability of organisms to survive intheir natural habitats. Global climate changes could be affecting the melanin content ofthe butterflies' wings over time and affecting their expressed phenotypic plasticity (Royand Sparks, 2000). As stated above, the cabbage white butterfly must achieve a bodytemperature above 35\u00b0C to achieve flight. However, if the butterfly reaches temperatures7above 40\u00b0C, they must rest and try to avoid heat through certain wing postures(Kingsolver and Buckley, 2015). If climates continue to have higher and highertemperatures due to global warming, it could pose a threat on the cabbage white butterflyspecies as a whole, unless they are able to utilize the melanin phenotypic plasticity tocombat the increasing temperatures.However, despite the possible effects of climate change, we still do not have astudy that examines wing pattern variation on larger ecological scales. This study will usemuseum specimens to quantify wing pattern variation in cabbage whites collected frommany locations over many decades. This will allow me to ask whether wing patternsvary seasonally, latitudinally, and over time periods possibly long enough to showevidence of wing pattern change due to climate change. If the plastic wing patterns of thebutterflies respond to temperature in measureable ways, and in a manner consistent withthat observed in other field (Stoehr and Goux 2008) and laboratory (Stoehr 2010) studies,I expect to see a lower level of melanization of the wingtip and wing spots during the falland spring compared to the melanization in the summer, as well as the opposite for theventral hind wing and discal cell region (high melanization in fall and spring, lowmelanization in summer.) (Figure 1 top). In addition, this seasonal pattern should besimilar, but shift up/down with latitude. Northern latitudes should have greatermelanization of the ventral hindwing and discal regions due to colder climates, as well asless melanization of the apex and wing spots for the same reason cornpared to southernlatitudes (Figure 1 bottom). Finally, if during the 110 years covered in this study., climatechange has had a measureable effect on wing patterns, then the seasonal pattern shouldshift to lesser melanization of the ventral hindwing and discal cell region with the reverse8seen in apex and wing spots due to a wanner climate (Figure 1 bottom). These latter twopredictions do assume that photoperiod has a negligible effect, and that the effects oflatitude and climate change do not interact i11complex ways. These assumptions will beaddressed in the \"Discussion\" of the paper.Wingtip/SpotsVHW/DiscalI.f)~rouI.f)\"D--- AQ)~ ..... ,cru ..... ,ID ~~Early Middle Late(spring) (summer) (fall)Seasona)Wingtip/SpotsVHW/Discal(/)~rou(j)U ---.

See text fordetails.9Materials and MethodsSpecimen OriginsI photographed 239 butterflies from the butterfly collections of Butler University(33 butterflies), Purdue University (39 butterflies), The University of Wisconsin,Madison (76 butterflies), and the Milwaukee Public Museum (91 butterflies). Butterflieswere collected between 1904-2014, a span of 110 years. Records of dates (day, month,year) captured, as well as location, were recorded for each butterfly used. When possible,the latitude, in decimal degrees, was determined for each capture location.PhotographingEach butterfly was photographed from both the dorsal and ventral side with aCanon EOS Digital Rebel T3i camera with a Canon EF 1OOmIn macro lens and CanonMR-14EX macro ring flash. The camera was mounted to a copy stand with the flash 26.9em from the specimen. Exposure settings were as follows: 'shutter speed 1/200, f-stopF16, ISO 100 and white balance was customized. The flash was set to ~ power.Wing Pattern MeasurementsEach dorsal and ventral photograph was uploaded and measured using the ObjectJplug-in running inside the digital image analysis program TInage] . This program utilized apre-determined threshold that effectively separated the black, melanized wing patterntraits from the white background (area of black scales in the measured space =melanization). Measurements of the area of melanization of the discal cell melanincontent (Figure 2a), of the ventral hindwing (Figure 2b), as well as the melanin content ofthe apex (Figure 2c) and forewing sexually dimorphic spots (Figure 2d). Wild caughtspecimens may not be in the best shape due to wear and tear from their environment. so I10was not able to get every measurement for every trait for all butterflies. Measurementswere obtained in pixels.a)C)b}d)Figure 2: Melanin plasticity on Pieris rapae wings. Areas of interest are outlinedin each picture. a) discal cell selection; b) ventral hindwing selection; c) apex spotselection; d) sexually dimorphic spot selection.Data AnalysisAlthough several traits were measured for each butterfly, I reduced the number of traitsfor each butterfly to two. First, the total area of the apex and spots (or spot, in the case ofmales) was summed to create a single overall measure of melanization for one trait andthe total area of melanized scales for the ventral hindwing and discal cell were added tocreate a second trait. This was done because previous work has shown that these two setsof traits tend to vary together (positively within each set, and negatively between the t\\VOsets) (Stoehr and Goux 2008, Kingsolver & Wiernasz 1991), and reducing the number oftraits reduced the number of analyses that had to be performed. Prior to analysis, the data11were checked for normality and ifnecessary, log transformed. Log transfonnations werenecessary for the ventral hindwing and discal melanization values for both sexes. Allfigures are presented with the transformed data, when such transformations were done.In addition, while capture date (day, month) and year and latitude were allrecorded as continuous variables, I grouped them to create categorical variables. Thisreduced the power of my statistical analyses, but greatly simplified them becauseotherwise complicated non-linear (because of how wing patterns change with season)multiple regression analyses would have been required. The date of capture was dividedroughly into thirds (prior to any analyses) to correspond to the early (before May 29),middle (June 1 - August 31), and late (after September I) part of the butterfly flightseason; from a weather perspective, this can be thought of as spring, summer and fall.The median year of capture was 1970, so the year of capture variable was categorized as\"before 1970\" or \"after 1970\". The median latitude was 42.7 decimal degrees, which isjust north of the Wisconsin/Illinois border, so butterflies collected north of 42.7 degreeslatitude were classified as \"northern\" and those south of 42.7 as \"southern\". The areas ofthe two composite traits were analyzed for males and females separately (because theyare sexuaIly dimorphic) using fully factorial analyses-of-variance.ResultsWe found statistically significant evidence showing that melanin in the ventralhindwings/discal cell of males (p ==0.0101; Table 1) as well as melanin found on theapex/spots (i.e. dorsal forewing traits, excluding discal cell) of both sexes (p 0.000 1females, Table I; P <0.000 1 males, Table 1) varies across seasons. Male ventralhindwing/discaI melanization was greatest in the spring (early season), and tended to be12lowest in summer (middle season) or to plateau in the summer and fall (late season)(Figures 3 & 4). For females, ventral hindwing/discal melanization followed qualitativelysimilar patterns for some females (i.e. females collected after 1970 and from northernlatitudes) but these results were not significant. In both sexes, the dorsal forewing traitshad the lowest area amounts of melanization during the spring (early) and tended to peakin the summer (middle season) or plateau then, showing similar or slightly lessmelanization in the fall (late) (Figures 5&6). The apex/spots (i.e. DFW traits) were notsignificantly more melanized in southern compared to northern latitudes in either sex,contrary to Illy prediction but the pattern, while not significant, is notable (Figures 4&6).The statistically significant interaction between latitude and decades for the DFW traits ofmales was small and not a primary prediction of my hypotheses (Table 1). Thisinteraction occurred because these traits were more melanized in animals collected before1970 at southern latitudes but the pattern was reversed at northern latitudes (no figure).Table 1: Statistical Analysis of male and female cabbage white butterflies.

This could be due toless of a need to thennoregulate (Kingsolver et al., 2011). This trend in increased melaninin the spots could occur due to less melanin needing to be devoted to discal cell andventral hindwing pigmentation on account of wanner temperatures as well as greaterresource availability in the summer. With higher temperatures in the summer, thebutterflies can focus their energy on traits dealing with sexual selection instead of traitsrelated to thermoregulation needed during spring and fall (Kemp and Rutowski, 2011).Female cabbage whites have two wing spots whereas males have just one, suggesting apossible role for the spots in sexual communication. Kingsolver (1985) suggested that theseasonal change in the apex and spots might also function in thennoregulation through analternative mechanism he calls \"reflectance basking\", but this hypothesis is not wellsupported and has been seriously criticized as being problematic (Heinrich 1990). Mypredictions concerning greater melanization of the dorsal forewing spots and apex stemsfrom experiments carried out in laboratory settings resulting in greater melanization ofthe DFW traits in a warm environment with a long photoperiod environment (Stoehr,2010).This seasonal trend matches my prediction; however there was less of a drop offin the late season, or fall, than expected. This could occur due to larvae that are16developing in this late period undergoing diapause to survive the winter, meaning theywill not eclose until the next spring. Short photoperiods can trigger the pupa to undergodiapause in preparation for winter (Kono, 1970). In other words, many of the butterfliescaptured in the late season may have been older butterflies that developed under wannertemperatures and longer days, whereas those developing in the cooler and shorter days offall would not have been caught until the following spring because they would have spentthe winter as pupae.In female butterflies, the effect of latitude was in the direction predicted but notquite significant. The apex and wing spots of southern latitude butterflies were generallylarger than those of northern latitude butterflies, while there was less melanization of theventral hindwing and discal cell area (Figure 6). This matches the wanner phenotypeexhibited during the summer. For male butterflies the pattern was similar for apex andwing spots, but not what I expected for the ventral hindwing and discal cell areas (Figure4). This could point to influences from photoperiod due to comparing northern andsouthern latitudes. Photoperiod changes much more significantly in the summercompared to fall and spring in northern latitudes compared to southern latitudes. Northernlatitudes will have colder temperatures, which will result in ITIOremelanization of thediscal area and ventral hindwing. However, the days will also be longer in northernlatitudes due to the earth being tilted toward the sun in the spring and SUITIlnermonths ofthe year. Because photoperiod will be longer, and longer photoperiods are exhibited insummer conditions, which produce less melanization in VHW traits, these longer dayswill signal for less melanization. Photoperiod and temperature could be canceling eachother out in northern latitudes. Along with influences of photoperiod and temperature17i~--\u00b7~-=:=::=~--::=====-~-----'\"'\"\"'\"\"':--:-:---:-:--~~-\"\"\"\"\"-------~-------------studied separately, the effects of elevation need to be studied. As stated earlier, butterflieshave been found in higher elevations and the natural wing melanizations of these higheraltitude dwelling butterflies need to be researched to see if there is a different pattern thatarises (Hughes, 2000).A greater number of specimens need to be examined with regard to the effects ofphotoperiod, temperature, and elevation on butterfly wing patterns. Through my research,museum specimens have been shown to be useful, especially due to the record keeping ofwhen the butterflies were caught. However, since my study mainly used butterfliesfocused in the midwestern states of the USA, cabbage white butterflies from otherparts of their geographic range should be examined. Future studies should alsoinvestigate more specific temperature ranges. If a cold spell was experienced in mid-July,the butterflies developing would possibly look more like fall or spring butterflies,skewing the data. These cold spell and wann spell butterflies need to be eliminated infuture data to help eliminate noise in the data. Past data suggests that my hypothesis isnot incorrect, but rather needs to be explored further and at greater depth. Since thetemperature of the earth has only increased by 0.6\u00b0C a much greater sample size isneeded to examine influences of such a small change (Tett et al., 1999)My research focused on museum specimens, which allowed rne to look at long-term changes within the melanin patterns of the cabbage white butterfly. One of the mainproblems facing scientists studying climate change is obtaining historical data. Historicaldata is necessary to understand patterns and test predictions of the impacts of climatechange (Johnson et al., 2010). By using museum specimens, I was able to look at atimespan of 110 years. Along with historical data, r was also able to gather butterflies18from a large geographical area due to the museums obtaining butterflies from statesoutside their own. The promise museum specimens hold in studying climate changeeffects on organisms has already been demonstrated. Two studies conducted by Parmesan(1996; 1999) have shown that butterflies are expanding northward compared to pastdecades in response to climate change creating 1110repromising environments forbutterfly species in the north. Climate change can affect either the ranges of organisms oreven the specific biology of the organism, through changes in phenotype (Suarez andTsutsui, 2004). Studying museum specimens coupled with wild butterflies has alreadyshown northward movement of certain butterfly species, which ultimately is increasingthe effect they have on the environment as an agricultural pest (Suarez and Tsutsui,2004). Climate change and its effects on the cabbage white butterfly are important tostudy due to the fact that it is an agricultural pest. Being able to predict what the changingenvironment will do to this butterfly will help fanners better combat the negative effectson their crops. Other species of butterflies have been shown to increase their range withthe wanner temperatures (Parmesan, 2003). The probler1_'!created by the increased rangealong with earlier first appearances is a greater impact on agricultural processes. Thecabbage white butterfly will affect greater amounts of land and fanners will need tocontrol the prohiems created for their crops.My study suggests that even though the cabbage white butterfly has establishedpattems of plasticity due to seasonal change (photoperiod and temperature), theseseasonally changing factors 111ayinteract with latitude and/or changing climate to producemore complex patterns of plasticity. The relationship between season, photoperiod andtelnperature not only varies \\\\ ith latitude, but as climate change alters temperature (but19not photoperiod) even Inore new combinations of potentially important environmentalcues will arise. Studying climate change in the context of the cabbage white butterflyneeds to be further explored across greater geographical expanses of latitudes andlongitudes.20ReferencesEllers, J., and Boggs, C.L. 2004.

The persistence of species that\nexperience such abiotic conditions may depend, in part, on\nthe presence of relatively mesic environments within drought-\nexposed landscapes\u2014i.e. \u2018hydrologic refugia\u2019 (McLaughlin\net al., 2017; Cartwright, 2018). The detection and protection\nof such climate change refugia is a key strategy for species con-\nservation (Keppel et al., 2011; Morelli et al., 2016). However,\nexisting methods for detecting refugia that involve modeling\nthe persistence of abiotic conditions within the suitable range\nfor target species or ecosystems (e.g. bioclimate envelope\nmodels) do not provide direct information on the sensitivity of\n..........................................................................................................................................................\nResearch article Conservation Physiology \u2022 Volume 8 2020\ntarget species due to local adaptation or acclimation (Pearson\nand Dawson, 2003). Assessing both the extent to which\nspecies are exposed to climate change driven droughts and\nhow local adaptation and acclimation contribute to species\nsensitivity is necessary for accurately predicting the responses\nof ecosystems to future conditions (Williams et al., 2008a;\nCrausbay et al. 2017).\nFrameworks for identifying and assessing conservation tar-\ngets that are based on amore complete understanding of plant\nphysiological responses to environmental stress are needed\nto address the threats climate change poses to ecosystems\n(Madlinger et al., 2018). Comparative trait-based approaches\nmay be able to improve detection of climate change refu-\ngia by directly assessing the true vulnerability (exposure +\nsensitivity) of plants to increasing drought (Fig. 1). Of par-\nticular utility in this context is the characterization of traits\nassociated with plant hydraulic function and carbon gain,\nwhich can be predictive of drought-induced plant mortality\nunder a warmer, drier future climate (McDowell et al., 2008;\nAnderegg et al., 2016; Venturas et al., 2017; Choat et al.,\n2018). While there may be multiple, interacting mechanisms\nthat drive plant mortality during drought (Sala et al., 2010;\nJacobsen et al., 2011; Sevanto et al., 2014), the risk of\nhydraulic failure\u2014i.e. the loss of the ability to transport\nwater due to drought-induced xylem cavitation\u2014is predictive\nacross a wide range of species and ecosystems (Jacobsen\net al., 2007b; Choat et al., 2012, 2018; Anderegg et al., 2016;\nAdams et al., 2017). Measurements of hydraulic traits can be\ncombined with seasonal water relations to estimate \u2018hydraulic\nsafety margins\u2019 as the difference between minimum water\nstatus (\u0002min) and the xylem pressure potential causing signif-\nicant xylem dysfunction (e.g. P50). Hydraulic safety margins\nprovide important, comparable information on the hydraulic\nfunction of plants experiencing contrasting environmental\nconditions that can be predictive of future drought-induced\nmortality (Choat et al., 2012; Skelton et al., 2015; Anderegg\net al., 2016).\nIslands are generally cooler, wetter and less seasonal than\nmainland environments due to strong maritime influences on\nisland climate (Weigelt et al., 2013). Such maritime conditions\nwithin semi-arid regions like southern California involve\nincreased coastal fog occurrence that may locally buffer plants\nfrom exposure to severe drought conditions (Fischer et al.,\n2009; Vasey et al., 2012; McLaughlin et al., 2017). In addi-\ntion, modeling approaches suggest that areas with strong\ncoastal influence will experience less pronounced warming\nover the next century (Lebassi et al., 2009; Potter, 2014).\nThese factors may allow islands to function as regional cli-\nmate refugia during worsening drought conditions with cli-\nmate change. However, whether local adaptation and/or phe-\nnotypic plasticity of plant hydraulic traits can offset the\nbenefits of more mesic environments is poorly understood.\nComparing hydraulic traits and, in particular, hydraulic safety\nmargins of island and mainland plant communities would\nFigure 1: Conceptual figure depicting two hypothesized\nrelationships between exposure (a and b), sensitivity (c and d) and\nvulnerability (e and f) that depend on how plant physiological traits\nvary across gradients. On one hand, if sensitivity is determined by\ntraits that are fine-tuned to local conditions (c)\u2014either through local\nadaptation or phenotypic plasticity\u2014then there is likely to be static\nvulnerability across the gradient (e). However, if sensitivity is\ndetermined by traits that are relatively conserved across a stress\ngradient (d), then vulnerability will be reduced in low exposure\nenvironments (right).\nprovide a test of relative drought vulnerability in these con-\ntrasting environments.\nSouthern California and the adjacent California Chan-\nnel Islands present an ideal study system for evaluating\nhydraulic safety in island versus mainland environments.\nDuring seasonal and inter-annual droughts in this region,\nmature chaparral shrubs can experience significant dieback\nand mortality (Schlesinger and Gill, 1978; Schlesinger\net al., 1982; Davis et al., 2002, Paddock et al., 2013,\nPratt et al., 2014, Venturas et al., 2016). As a result,\nthese environments have selected for plants with highly\n..........................................................................................................................................................\n2\n..........................................................................................................................................................\nConservation Physiology \u2022 Volume 8 2020 Research article\ndrought tolerant functional strategies, including many with\nhigh xylem cavitation resistance (Ackerly, 2004; Bhaskar\net al., 2007; Jacobsen et al., 2008). Previous studies in these\nsystems have shown that cavitation resistance and hydraulic\nsafety can vary seasonally (Jacobsen et al., 2007a, 2014;\nPivovaroff et al., 2015) and inter-annually (Jacobsen et al.,\n2007b) within particular species. Also, hydraulic traits have\nbeen shown to vary between species with different life history\nstrategies (Redtfeldt and Davis, 1996; Kolb and Davis, 1994;\nDavis et al., 1999; Jacobsen et al., 2007b) and across different\nsemi-arid plant communities (i.e. chaparral, coastal sage\nscrub, and desert scrub) in southern California (Jacobsen\net al.,2008).However, few studies have investigated hydraulic\ntraits on the California Channel Islands (But, see Jacobsen\net al., 2018), where the maritime climate and geographic\nisolation of island environments create a high likelihood of\nevolutionary divergence in adaptive traits (Ackerly, 2003).\nIn addition, biogeographic patterns of vegetation on the\nCalifornia Channel Islands have long been suspected as evi-\ndence of more buffered conditions on the islands that allowed\nthe persistence of taxa once widespread in other parts of\nCalifornia (Axelrod, 1967; Raven and Axelrod, 1978). The\nexisting narrative for this pattern is that the islands provided\na cooler, wetter climate that facilitated this persistence. A\ntrait-based approach to testing the hypothesis that the islands\nfunction as a climate, and more specifically a hydrologic,\nrefugia could provide a mechanistic explanation for these\nlong-observed biogeographic patterns.\nA common limitation of studies that compare traits across\nenvironments is not accounting for phylogenetic relationships\nbetween taxa, which can make it difficult to interpret trait\npatterns driven by the statistical non-independence of closely\nrelated species (Felsenstein, 1985; Harvey and Pagel, 1991;\nMaherali et al., 2004). One solution to this problem is\nto incorporate phylogenetic information that can be used\nto investigate differences among a series of closely related\ntaxonomic pairs (Westoby et al., 1998; Westoby, 1999;\nAckerly, 2000). Collecting data that takes into account the\nphylogenetic relationships between taxa allows for more\naccurate linkage of trait patterns to the underlying responses\nto different environments (Ackerly and Donoghue, 1998).\nHere, we present data to assess the relative drought vul-\nnerability of native woody plant communities on the Cali-\nfornia Channel Islands and the adjacent southern California\nmainland, sites which harbor similar plant assemblages but\ndiffer in the strength of maritime-influence on the local\nclimate (Figs 2 and 3). Our research aims to (i) determine\nif the maritime climate of island environments is sufficient\nto buffer native California plants from 21st century drought\nconditions exacerbated by climate change and (ii) to evaluate\na trait-based method for detecting the physiological mech-\nanisms of hydrologic refugia that can be applied to other\nsystems.\nFigure 2: Locations (a), mean annual climate (b) and temperature\nseasonality (c) of southern California region based on historical\nweather station records (viaWestern Regional Climate Center: http://\nwww.wrcc.dri.edu).

Matched island (Santa Catalina Island) and\nmainland (Santa Ana Mountains) field sites are indicated by a blue\nand red star, respectively, in each figure. Despite their proximity and\nsimilar mean annual climates, island and mainland field sites are on\nopposite ends of the temperature seasonality spectrum, with the\nisland site experiencing lower summer and higher winter tempera-\ntures (i.e. a more maritime climate).

The island site was located on\nthe east (channel-facing) slope of SCI near Blackjack Moun-\ntain (33\u25e623\u203238.1\u2032\u2032N; 118\u25e623\u203250.4\u2032\u2032W). The mainland site was\nlocated on the east slope of the Santa Ana Mountains in the\nCleveland National Forest (33\u25e638\u203244.6\u2032\u2032N; 117\u25e623\u203246.6\u2032\u2032W),\noverlooking Lake Elsinore, CA (Fig. 2). These sites were\nselected to maximize similarity in latitude, slope, aspect,\nelevation, soil characteristics, mean annual precipitation/tem-\nperature and species composition across the island\u2013mainland\nenvironments (Table 1, Fig. 2).\nSite climate characteristics were estimated from local\nweather station data managed by the Western Regional\nClimate Center (http://www.wrcc.dri.edu). Long-term weather\ninformation (1897\u20132016 mainland; 1909\u20132016 island) was\navailable from stations within 10 km and at similar elevations\nto both field sites. In addition, site-level temperature and\nhumidity (at 30-min interval) were recorded during the 3-year\nstudy using HOBO data loggers placed at each site (Onset\n..........................................................................................................................................................\n4\n..........................................................................................................................................................\nConservation Physiology \u2022 Volume 8 2020 Research article\nComputer Corporation, Bourne, MA, USA). Similarity of soil\ncharacteristics was determined by analyzing soil particle size\n(% sand, % silt and % clay) and soil fertility (Total N and\nTotal C) in the top 10 cm (Table 1). Soil samples (n= 6)\nwere collected within 2 days from both island and mainland\nfield sites and transported to UC Berkeley for processing.\nSamples were analyzed by the UC Davis Analytical Labs\n(https://anlab.ucdavis.edu/analysis/Soils/320). In brief, Total N\nand Total C were quantitatively determined via a combustion\nmethod with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) system\nand an IR detector. This method is based on the oxidation of\nthe sample during flash combustion that converts nitrogen\nand carbon substances into combustion gases and has a\ndetection limit of 0.02% for C andN (AOACOfficialMethod\n972.43, 1997). In addition, % sand, % silt and % clay were\ndetermined based on settling rates in an aqueous solution\nusing a hydrometer (Sheldrick and Wang, 1993). The chief\ndifference between sites was the strength of the maritime\ninfluence on temperature seasonality, with the island site\nexperiencing more moderate conditions\u2014cooler summers\nand warmer winters\u2014compared to the more seasonally\nvariable and extreme mainland site (Fig. 2).\nTen phylogenetically independent island\u2013mainland taxon\npairs (seven congeneric and three conspecific pairs) were\nused in this study (Fig. 3). The 10 island\u2013mainland pairs\nwere spread across five plant families and were representative\nof the dominant lineages in southern California chaparral.\nIncluded in these pairs were several species endemic to the\nChannel Islands (Prunus ilicifolia ssp. lyonii, Quercus paci-\nfica, Ceanothus megacarpus var. insularis and Ceanothus\narboreus) and one species endemic to Santa Catalina Island\n(Arctostaphylos catalinae). With one exception, all island\u2013\nmainland pairs belonged to distinct genera; in the genus\nCeanothus taxon pairs were drawn from each of the two\ndistinct subgenera (Ceanothus-Ceanothus and Ceanothus-\nCerastes), which often exhibit different functional and life\nhistory traits (McMinn, 1942; Nobs, 1963; Ackerly et al.,\n2006; Fross and Wilken, 2006; Pratt et al., 2008; Burge et al.,\n2011). Because the experimental design includes comparisons\nof both congeneric and conspecific pairs, we will refer to all\nspecies pairs as \u2018taxa\u2019 or \u2018taxon pairs\u2019 for clarity.\nSeasonal water relations and chlorophyll\nfluorescence\nTo determine plant water status, monthly to bi-monthly\nmeasurements (March 2012\u2013March 2013) of leaf water\npotential (\u0002w) were estimated using a pressure chamber\n(PMS Instrument Company, Albany, OR, USA). At predawn\n(4\u20146 am; \u0002pd) and midday (12\u20142 pm, \u0002md), leaves of\nsix individuals per taxon (6 indiv. \u00d7 10 taxa = 60 samples\nat each site) were harvested, bagged and placed in an ice\nchest. Samples were immediately (typically within 30 min.)\nused to estimate leaf water potential in the field using\npressure chambers and attached portable N tanks. Care\nwas taken to select the youngest healthy, fully mature leaves\nand branchlets exposed to full sun. In addition to analyzing\nseasonal patterns in \u0002pd and \u0002md, the minimum water\npotential (\u0002min) measured at midday during the end of the\ndry season (September 2012) was compared between island\u2013\nmainland taxon pairs. Measurements were always recorded\nthe same day within a site and within 2 days across sites,\nusing the same techniques and equipment.\nStomatal conductance was measured during the study\n(June 2012\u2013March 2013) using a steady-state leaf porom-\neter (SC-1, Decagon Devices, Pullman, WA). Measurements\nwere performed on six fully mature, sun-exposed leaves per\ntaxon (6 indiv.\u00d7 10 taxa = 60 measurements). To account for\ndiurnal fluctuations in atmospheric and solar condition, these\nmeasurements were always conducted during the same time\nof day (9 am\u201412 pm), during mostly clear (i.e. cloud-free)\ndays. Minimum values of stomatal conductance measured at\nthe end of the dry season (September 2012) were compared\nacross island and mainland sites.\nTo determine drought stress effects on leaf photosynthetic\ncapacity, intrinsic quantum efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm) was\nmeasured at midday during the peak of the dry season\n(September 2012) using a pulse-modulated chlorophyll\nfluorometer (FMS2, Hansatech, Pentney, Norfolk, UK).Mea-\nsurements were conducted on the same individuals measured\nfor seasonal water relations. Prior to measurements, leaves\nwere dark-adapted for 15\u201320 min using dark adaptation leaf\nclips (Hansatech, Pentney, Norfolk, UK). Initial fluorescence\n(Fo) was measured using low levels of light followed by a\nsaturating pulse of light (15 000 \u03bcmols m\u22122 s\u22121) to measure\nmaximum fluorescence (Fm). Variable fluorescence (Fv)\nwas calculated as initial minus maximum fluorescence\nand intrinsic quantum efficiency of PSII was expressed\nas Fv/Fm.\nHydraulic traits and safety margins\nTo determine the sensitivity of stem xylem to drought condi-\ntions, cavitation resistance was estimated with vulnerability\ncurves using a standard centrifuge technique with a con-\nductivity apparatus (Alder et al., 1997; Tobin et al., 2013;\nSupplementary Fig. S8). Stems approximately 5\u20136 mm in\ndiameter were harvested from the same six individuals per\ntaxon used for seasonal water relations. The samples were\nbagged and transported to a laboratory where they were\nrefrigerated until measurements could be performed (within\n7 days). Prior to measurements, stems were cut to either\n140 or 270 mm long and flushed for 60 min at 100 kPa to\nremove emboli with an ultra-filtered (0.1 \u03bcm pore exclusion\nfilter) solution of deionized and degassed 20 mM KCl solu-\ntion. The longer stem lengths were used for taxa that had\nextremely high resistance to cavitation (e.g. Ceanothus spp.)\nand spun in a larger centrifuge rotor capable of delivering\ngreater levels of centrifugal force to the water column. In some\ncases, stems were rehydrated overnight under a vacuum using\nthe same degassed 20 mM KCl solution, in place of flush-\ning. Following flushing (or vacuum rehydration), hydraulic\n..........................................................................................................................................................\n5\n..........................................................................................................................................................\nResearch article Conservation Physiology \u2022 Volume 8 2020\nconductivity (Kh) of stem xylem was measured using a tubing\napparatus under a low-pressure head (about 4 kPa). This gave\nthe maximum Kh (Khmax) with xylem emboli removed. Stems\nwere then spun in a centrifuge to generate negative xylem\ntension and repeatedly measured to determine loss of Kh with\ndecreasing water potential. Percentage loss of Kh (PLC) was\ncalculated as:\nLoss of Kh (%) =\n(\n1 \u2212 Kh/Khmax\n) \u00d7 100\nVulnerability curves were constructed by plotting decreas-\ning values of water potential versus PLC (supplementary\nmaterials). Stem-specific hydraulic conductivity (Ks) and cavi-\ntation resistance (P50) were estimated from each vulnerability\ncurve. P50 was calculated as the water potential at which\n50% of hydraulic conductivity (Kh) was lost due to cavita-\ntion of xylem conduits. Ks was calculated by dividing the\nmaximumhydraulic conductivity by the xylem cross-sectional\narea (mm2). Measurements of P50 were combined with the\nminimum seasonal water potential measured at the end of\nthe 2012 dry season (\u0002min) to calculate the hydraulic safety\nmargin (HSM50) for each taxon (n = 6):\nHSM50 = \u0002min \u2212 P50\nVulnerability curves were measured on 9 of the 10 island\u2013\nmainland taxon pairs in two sampling efforts. Five pairs were\nmeasured in Summer/Fall 2010 (Arctostaphylos, Ceanothus-\nCeanothus, Ceanothus-Cerastes, Heteromeles and Quercus)\nand four pairs were measured in Summer/Fall 2012 (Adenos-\ntoma, Cercocarpus, Prunus, Rhus). Because vulnerability\ncurves were not calculated for Rhamnus ilicifolia, due to\na sampling error, the Rhamnus pair was removed from this\nanalysis. While measurements of vulnerability curves were\nperformed in different years, measurements within taxon\npairs were always performed in the same season and year.\nTherefore, seasonal and inter-annual variation in cavitation\nresistance (Jacobsen et al., 2007a,b, 2014) should not affect\ncomparisons within taxon pairs.\nSome of the taxa measured have known vessel lengths\nlonger than the excised stems used here to measure vul-\nnerability curves (Jacobsen et al., 2012). Recent work has\ndemonstrated that the \u2018long vessel artefact\u2019 (Cochard et al.,\n2010) is not an issue when using standard centrifuge methods\nlike those presented here (Tobin et al., 2013; Hacke et al.,\n2015; Pratt et al., 2019; Jacobsen et al. 2019; Jacobsen and\nPratt et al., 2012; Sperry et al., 2012). However, some readers\nmay still be concerned about such an effect (Skelton et al.,\n2018). Therefore, in order to demonstrate our findings are\nrobust in the face of current debates on methodology, we\nhave analyzed our hydraulic trait data (P50 and HSM50) in\nmultiple ways to illustrate the effects of different curve shapes\non our main findings, which are consistent across alternative\nanalytical approaches (see Supplementary Table S3).\nXylem density (XD) was measured by dividing the dry\nmass of xylem tissue by its water-saturated volume. To mea-\nsure XD, \u223c5 cm long segments were cut from the same stems\nused to construct vulnerability curves. The segments were cut\nlongitudinally and the pith and bark were removed manu-\nally. The segments were then soaked overnight in degassed\nwater brought to a pH of 2. The volume of fully saturated\nstem segments was determined using Archimedes principle.\nFollowing volume measurements, stem segments were dried\nto a constant weight in a drying oven and dry mass was\ndetermined using a four-digit balance.\nRemote sensing of drought response\nIn order to determine if observed trait patterns were\nassociated with broader vegetation responses to recent\ndrought events in our study area, we analyzed the Enhanced\nVegetation Index (EVI) derived from Landsat surface\nreflectance data (NASA/USGS; 30 m resolution), accessed\nvia the Climate Engine web tool (Huntington et al., 2017).\nEVI is similar to the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index\n(NDVI), widely used as an index to monitor vegetation health\nduring drought (e.g. Byer and Jin 2017), but optimizes the\nvegetation signal by reducing noise from canopy background\nand atmospheric conditions (Liu and Huete, 1995). We\ngenerated time series of mean summer EVI (June\u2013August)\nfrom 2000 to 2017 for the three California Channel Islands\nwith significant chaparral components (Santa Catalina, Santa\nCruz, and Santa Rosa Island).We also generated summer EVI\nvalues for chaparral-dominated areas in three south coast\nmountain ranges (Santa Monica, Santa Ynez, and Santa Ana\nmountain ranges). These areas were selected because they\noccur at similar latitudes, elevational ranges, and have similar\nvegetation composition as the three California Channel\nIslands analyzed (Supplementary Fig. S1).\nWe categorized the EVI data into drought and non-drought\nyears based on the U.S. Drought Monitor categorizations\nfor the south coast region. Non-drought years were used\nto calculate an EVI \u201cbaseline\u201d for each area. This baseline\nwas then used to quantify departures of EVI from normal\nconditions by calculating z-scores:\nz = EVIyear \u2212 EVIbaseline\n\u03c3baseline.\nwhere EVIbaseline and \u03c3 baseline represent the mean and\ninterannual standard deviation for baseline years and EVIyear\nis the mean summer EVI value for a given year. This z-score-\nbased method has recently been shown to track drought-\ninduced declines in vegetation health in the Sierra Nevada\nMountains, California, during the recent multi-year drought\n(Byer and Jin 2017).\nMean z-scores for island and mainland areas were com-\nputed and compared for two drought periods: the single-year\ndrought of 2007 and the recent multi-year drought (2012\u2013\n2017). Special attention was paid to the EVI patterns during\nand immediately following these two drought events to com-\npare both the drought resistance (magnitude of decline in EVI\n..........................................................................................................................................................\n6\n..........................................................................................................................................................\nConservation Physiology \u2022 Volume 8 2020 Research article\nduring drought) and resilience (magnitude of EVI improve-\nment post-drought) of island and mainland vegetation.\nStatistical analyses\nSeasonal water potential and stomatal conductance were\nanalyzed using repeated-measures ANOVA with site (island/-\nmainland), taxon-pair and date as independent variables and\nplant ID (i.e. individual) as a random, nested variable (Sup-\nplementary Table S1). Mean values for minimum stomatal\nconductance, minimum water potential, chlorophyll fluo-\nrescence, cavitation resistance, xylem density and hydraulic\nsafety margins were compared using a mixed-model ANOVA\nwith site (island/mainland) as a fixed factor and taxon-pair\nas a random variable nested within site. This model was used\nto test for general differences between island\u2013mainland pairs\n(Supplementary Table S2). Additional pairwise comparisons\nwere used to test for differences within species pairs when a\nsignificant site \u00d7 taxon interaction was detected. A two-way\nANOVA was used to compare mean EVI z-scores between\nisland andmainland environments, and pairwise comparisons\nwere used to test for differences during specific drought and\npost-drought years.\nResults\nSeasonal water relations\nPredawn water potential (\u0002pd) varied throughout the study\n(Fig. 4, Supplementary Table S2, Supplementary Figs S4 and\nS5) with maximum (least negative) values (\u0002max) recorded\nduring the wet season (March 2012 and 2013) and minimum\n(most negative) values (\u0002min) recorded during the peak of the\ndry season (September 2012). Within each site, taxa differed\nin \u0002pd, especially during the dry season (Fig. 4, Supple-\nmentary Figs S4 and S5). Shallower-rooted, more cavitation\nresistant taxa (e.g. Ceanothus-Cerastes and Arctostaphylos)\nexhibited more negative \u0002pd than deeper-rooted, less cavi-\ntation resistant taxa (e.g. Heteromeles, Quercus, and Rhus).\nDifferences across sites were 2 MPa lower for mainland\nvegetation on average (Supplementary Fig. S5), but varied by\ntaxon pair, resulting in a significant site \u00d7 taxon interaction\n(Supplementary Table S1). Stomatal conductance (gs) exhib-\nited little variation seasonally (Fig. 4, Supplementary Table\nS1). However, for most taxa, the lowest values of gs were\nmeasured during the peak of the dry season (Fig. 4), sug-\ngesting plants experienced drought-induced stomatal closure.\nDifferences across sites varied by taxon pair, resulting in a\nsignificant site \u00d7 taxon interaction (Supplementary Table S1).\nMinimum seasonal water potential,\nstomatal conductance and chlorophyll\nfluorescence\nDuring the peak of the dry season (September 2012),\npredawn water potential (\u0002pd), stomatal conductance (gs)\nand chlorophyll fluorescence (Fv/Fm) were higher (more\nfavorable) for island plants compared to mainland relatives\n(Fig. 5, Supplementary Table S1; P<0.001). Generally, deep-\nrooted taxa that resprout after fire (e.g. Rhus, Heteromeles,\nPrunus) had the highest (least negative) \u0002, while more\nshallow-rooted, obligate seeders (e.g. Ceanothus-Cerastes,\nArctostaphylos) had the most negative water potentials\n(Figs 5a, 6a, Supplementary Table S2, Supplementary Figs\nS4 and S5). Deep-rooted resprouters also had the largest\ndifferences in gs across sites (Fig. 5b, Supplementary Table\nS2), but the largest differences in Fv/Fm were observed\nin non-sprouting Arctostaphylos (Fig. 5c, Supplementary\nTable S2).\nHydraulic traits and safety margins\nNone of the measured stem hydraulic traits (Ks, P50, or\nXD) were consistently different between island\u2014mainland\nsites (P> 0.05; Supplementary Table S2). Significant pair-\nwise comparisons of Ks were recorded for Ceanothus-\nCeanothus, Adenostoma, Cercocarpus and Prunus. Resis-\ntance to drought-induced cavitation (P50) varied widely\nbetween taxa, with similar ranges at each site (\u22121 to\n\u221211 MPa; Fig. 6). However, there were no consistent dif-\nferences between island\u2013mainland taxon pairs (F1,94 = 3.952;\nP= 0.117). OnlyHeteromeles exhibited a significant pairwise\ncomparison, with greater resistance on the mainland\n(P< 0.05; Supplementary Table S2). Xylem density, XD,\nwas also not consistently different between island\u2013mainland\nrelatives (F1,109 = 0.405; P= 0.526). None of the pairwise\ncomparisons of XD were significantly different (P< 0.05;\nSupplementary Table S2).\nHydraulic safety margins (HSM50) also varied widely\nbetween taxa (\u22124 to +5 MPa; Fig. 7). Nine of 18 taxa\nmeasured had negative safety margins, suggesting they are\nlikely to experience > 50% loss of hydraulic conductivity\nduring the peak of the dry season (some of the negative safety\nmargins may reflect long-vessel artifacts affecting the P50\nvalues). In general, taxa maintained the same ranking in safety\nmargin across sites\u2014i.e. taxa with high safety margins relative\nto other taxa on the mainland also had high safety margins\non the island. Importantly, island taxa had consistently higher\nsafety margins (F1,94 = 37.950; P< 0.01) with significant\npairwise comparisons in 7 out of 9 taxon pairs (Fig. 7).\nOur findings of no difference in P50 and strong differences\nin HSM50 between island\u2013mainland taxa are consistent\nwhether or not long-vesseled taxa are included in the analysis\n(Table S3).\nRemote sensing of responses to recent\ndrought\nInterannual variation in mean summer EVI z-scores allowed\nfor meaningful comparison of island and mainland vegetation\nresponses to recent drought events (Fig. 8).

In addition, the\nisland vegetation rebounded more quickly in the first year\nafter the drought (P< 0.05). The patterns were similar during\nthe recent \u2018exceptional\u2019 multi-year drought (2012\u20132016).\nHowever, during the third and fourth years of the drought,\nincreased variability in island EVI resulted in no statistically\nsignificant differences between island and mainland environ-\nments during these years. The island plants also had more\nfavorable EVI response following the multi-year drought\n(P< 0.05).\nDiscussion\nConservative traits result in greater\nhydraulic safety for island plants\nWe did not observe consistent differences in cavitation resis-\ntance (P50) between island\u2013mainland sites. This lack of a\ndifference in P50 between sites with different levels of water\navailability is surprising considering global meta-analyses that\nshow P50 values closely match environmental patterns of\nwater availability (e.g. Choat et al., 2012).

P-values for paired statistical comparisons are depicted in the\nlower right corner of each plot.\nFigure 6: Minimum seasonal water potential (\u0002min; a) and cavitation resistance (P50; b) for island\u2013mainland species pairs. These traits serve as\nproxies for exposure versus sensitivity to drought and are the components used to estimate hydraulic safety margins and provide a quantitative\ntest of the conceptual model linking physiological trait patterns to detection of climate refugia (Fig. 1).

However, our findings suggest that there\nmay be important exceptions on a regional to local scale,\nwhere P50 does not closely track patterns of water availability.\nThis is consistent with studies comparing hydraulic traits\nbetween intraspecific populations in coastal and drier interior\nsites (Jacobsen and Pratt, 2013; Jacobsen et al., 2014), as\nwell as community-level analyses of different semi-arid plant\ncommunities (Jacobsen et al., 2007a).\nIt is not clear why island taxa possess levels of cavitation\nresistance similar to mainland relatives living in drier environ-\nments. One hypothesis for the disparity between water avail-\nability and P50 is that cavitation resistance arises from selec-\ntion at the seedling stage, when the risk of drought-induced\ncavitation is high due to a small, developing root system\u2019s\nneed to provide enough water for a rapidly growing shoot\n(Frazer and Davis, 1988; Thomas and Davis 1989; Schwilk\nand Ackerly, 2005; Pratt et al., 2008). Another hypothesis\nis that cavitation thresholds are set during severe episodic\ndroughts (Pockman and Sperry, 2000), suggesting that water\navailability and P50 may be decoupled during more normal\nconditions. However, in order for these hypotheses to explain\nthe patterns in the present study, water stress would have to\nbe similar between island and mainland plants at the seedling\nstage but not at the adult stage, or island and mainland plants\nwould need to experience similar conditions during episodic\ndroughts but not during the intervening years. Neither of\nthese explanations seems very likely considering the consis-\ntent gradient in climate that exists between the island and\nmainland environments (Fig. 2; Weigelt et al., 2013).\nAnother factor that may explain the lack of P50 differences\nbetween island\u2013mainland pairs is the weak relationship\nbetween hydraulic safety and hydraulic efficiency. In studies\nthat account for phylogenetic similarity, no correlation\nbetween P50 and hydraulic conductivity (Ks) is typically\nobserved (Maherali et al., 2004; Bhaskar et al., 2007;\nJacobsen et al., 2007b). Therefore, it is possible that the trade-\n..........................................................................................................................................................\n9\n..........................................................................................................................................................\nResearch article Conservation Physiology \u2022 Volume 8 2020\nFigure 7: Box plots of hydraulic safety margins (HSM50 =\u0002min\u2014P50) for nine island-mainland species pairs. Blue background indicates higher\nsafety margin for island species (8/9 pairs); red background indicates lower safety margin for island species (1/9 pairs). Asterisks denote\nsignificant pairwise comparisons (P< 0.05).\noffs between hydraulic safety and efficiency are not strong\nenough to drive selection against high cavitation resistance\nonce it has evolved in a lineage. Consistent with this are\nstudies that have shown cavitation resistance to be a highly\nconserved trait (Lamy et al., 2011; Hao et al., 2008; Wilson et\nal., 2008; Pittermann et al., 2012). In the present study, we are\ncomparing island lineages, most likely descended from main-\nland taxa that migrated to the islands to their contemporary\nmainland relatives. Colonization of the island by mainland\ntaxa occurred at some point during the approximately\n500 000 years that the island has been continuously above\nwater (Schoenherr et al., 1999). It is possible that island\nplants have retained the high cavitation resistance of their\nmainland ancestors due to weak selection against it, coupled\nwith the relatively short time that they have been isolated on\nthe island environment.\nIn general, few studies examine the spatial and temporal\nvariation in hydraulic traits (Anderegg, 2015). Of those that\ndo, similar evidence of low variability across environmental\ngradients is often observed (e.g. Jacobsen and Pratt, 2013;\nJacobsen et al., 2014; Skelton et al., 2019). The observed low\nspatial variability in hydraulic traits may be explained, in part,\nby high phylogenetic conservatism in such traits (Lamy et\nal., 2011; Hao et al., 2008; Pittermann et al., 2012; Skelton\net al., 2018), This suggests that many plants may be relatively\nprotected from hydraulic failure compared to close relatives\nor ecotypes in comparatively drier environments. Therefore,\nhydrologic refugia capable of buffering plants from hydraulic\nfailure may be common in nature.\nThe lack of variation in hydraulic traits does not preclude\nvariation in other important functional traits that allow island\ntaxa to achieve a \u2018fit\u2019 with their contemporary environ-\nment. Hochberg (1980) first analyzed differences in leaf traits\nbetween island and mainland shrubs native to southern Cali-\nfornia, finding that island plants exhibitedmoremesomorphic\n(i.e. drought-sensitive) traits. In addition, Bowen and Vuren\n(1997) found that plants from Santa Cruz Island, California,\npossessed less robust leaves that made them preferred forage\nfor exotic herbivores. Salladay and Ramirez (2018) found\nsimilar results for leaves of several island plant species on\nSanta Catalina Island. Either stronger selection or greater\nphenotypic plasticity in leaf traits may explain the differences\nobserved between these previous studies and the current one.\nIsland plants are buffered from seasonal\nand interannual drought conditions\nDespite similar precipitation regimes, island plants had higher\nwater availability and experienced less water stress during the\ndry season as evidenced by higher (less negative) water poten-\ntials, higher stomatal conductance and higher chlorophyll\nfluorescence. Furthermore, remotely sensed health (via EVI\nanalysis) of island plants was less impacted by recent drought\nevents. These findings are consistent with a recent study\ncomparing the dry season water relations of Arctostaphy-\nlos spp. in maritime versus interior chaparral sites in Cal-\nifornia (Vasey et al., 2012; Jacobsen and Pratt, 2013). In\nthat study, water relations differences between maritime and\ninterior Arctostaphylos populations were explained by the\n..........................................................................................................................................................\n10\n..........................................................................................................................................................\nConservation Physiology \u2022 Volume 8 2020 Research article\nFigure 8: Time-series of mean summer (JJA).

It\nis likely that these factors\u2014reduced evaporative demand and\nincreased summertime fog\u2014also affect plant water relations\non the California Channel Islands (Williams et al., 2008b;\nFischer et al., 2009; Carbone et al., 2011; Taylor et al., 2019;\nSupplementary Fig. S3).\nAnother factor that may be related to dry season water\nrelations in island and mainland sites is reduced shrub density\nresulting from prior land use patterns. Island chaparral com-\nmunities on SCI are less dense, exhibiting a more open canopy\nstructure than mainland chaparral communities (Hochberg,\n1980;Minnich, 1982; Schoenherr et al.,1999; Supplementary\nFig. S6). This pattern is thought to largely be an artifact of\n19th and 20th century land use practices on SCI\u2014specifically,\novergrazing by feral animals\u2014and may not reflect the \u2018nat-\nural\u2019 state of SCI plant communities (Minnich, 1982; Rick\net al.,2014). Previous studies in southern California chaparral\nand coastal sage communities have shown that decreased\ntranspiration and improved water availability are associated\nwith low woody vegetation density (Ng and Miller, 1980;\nPoole and Miller, 1975).\nReducing stand density and competition for water is\nhypothesized to improve individual plant water relations and\nis a theoretical justification for the thinning of forest stands as\na strategy for managing drought impacts (Grant et al., 2013;\nMcDowell and Allen, 2015; Bradford and Bell, 2017). It is\npossible that a similar process takes place in SCI chaparral\ncommunities where the altered canopy structure (i.e. reduced\nstand density) results in reduced competition by woody\nplants for deeper water sources, leaving more water available\nto the remaining individuals in the community (Hochberg,\n1980). However, recent work from another semi-arid system\nfinds little evidence for this \u2018moisture release hypothesis\u2019,\nsuggesting instead that any reductions in competition are\noffset by increased water loss from exposed soil, wind and\nchanges in hydraulic redistribution (Morillas et al., 2017).\nIt should also be noted that the potential role of introduced\nherbivores in improving outcomes of island plants is limited.\nRamirez et al. (2012) found that browsing by mule deer\non Santa Catalina Island caused high post-fire mortality\u2014\npresumably, via carbon starvation\u2014despite these populations\nhaving a reduced risk of hydraulic failure compared to the\nmainland. Future studies designed to isolate the effects of\nmaritime climate and stand density may help determine their\nindependent roles in determining seasonal water relations of\nplants in this system.\nWhile increased buffering of mature island chaparral\nshrubs was observed in the present study, drought stress may\nstill play an important role in island sites through impacts to\npost-fire seedlings and resprouts, as well as localized impacts\non drought-sensitive species. In a recent study of three island\nchaparral species from Catalina Island, Jacobsen et al. (2018)\nfound that seedlings recruiting after a recent fire experienced\nhigh levels of mortality and that cavitation resistance was pre-\ndictive of these mortality patterns. In addition, indirect effects\nof drought such as increased browsing pressure on delicate\nregenerating vegetation during drought years may contribute\nto post-fire mortality patterns (Ramirez et al., 2012). On\nSanta Cruz Island, southern California, bishop pines (Pinus\nmuricataD.Don) have experienced drought-related mortality\nduring recent drought events (Baguskas et al., 2016; Taylor\net al., 2019). Furthermore, there may be limits to the buffering\nobserved in the present study for drought-tolerant chaparral\nspecies that will be crossed during continued warming,\ndrying climate trends. Like other climate change refugia,\nthe persistence of species and ecosystems in hydrologic\nrefugia may only provide a temporary climate buffer (Millar\net al., 2007; Morelli et al., 2016; McLaughlin et al., 2017).\nHydraulic safety reveals hydrologic refugia\nThe improved safety margins we observed in island chaparral\nshrubs may allow them to fare better during episodes of\nincreasing aridity. Greater hydraulic safety in island plants\nindicates that they are able to tolerate greater declines in\nminimum seasonal water potential before they experience\nthe same amount of drought-induced cavitation as mainland\nrelatives. Our remote sensing of island vegetation responses\nduring recent droughts suggests this buffering may improve\ndrought resistance and resilience in these environments.\nTherefore, as the regional patterns of climate change in\nCalifornia trend towards warmer, drier conditions, chaparral\nshrubs living on the California Channel Islands may\nexperience less drought-induced cavitation, fewer declines\nin performance and lower rates of mortality compared to\nmainland plants with lower hydraulic safety margins.\nImproved safety margins may also have been a factor\nduring past episodes of climate change, contributing to the\npattern of relictual endemism on the California Channel\nIslands.Many of the woody endemics on the California Chan-\nnel Islands are thought to be remnant populations of lineages\nthat once had broader distributions (Axelrod, 1967; Raven\nand Axelrod, 1978; Schoenherr et al., 1999). The general\nexplanation offered for this pattern of relictual endemism\non the California Channel Islands is that changing climatic\nconditions since the late Tertiary has resulted in extirpation of\nmainland populations and persistence of island populations\ndue to more favorable climate and reduced competition in\ninsular environments. Our findings allow for such explana-\ntions to be taken a step further by suggesting that reduced\nrisk of hydraulic failure may have contributed to woody plant\nlineages persisting on the California Channel Islands during\npast transitions to warmer, drier climates.\nIn conclusion, insular plant communities off the coast of\nsouthern California have more favorable hydraulic traits that\nunderlie greater resistance and resilience to seasonal and inter-\nannual droughts. This buffering is associated with the finding\nthat island plants do not appear to have \u2018fine-tuned\u2019 their stem\nhydraulic traits in response to the higher water availability\nin their current insular environment and, therefore, have a\n..........................................................................................................................................................\n12\n..........................................................................................................................................................\nConservation Physiology \u2022 Volume 8 2020 Research article\nreduced risk of hydraulic failure. This pattern of improved\nhydraulic safety in island plants may have contributed to\ncurrent biogeographic patterns of endemic island lineages\nand may continue to buffer island plants from hotter, drier\nconditions associated with anthropogenic climate change in\nthis or other systems. Furthermore, the identification of high\nsafetymargin taxa or ecotypes using the comparativemethods\ndescribed here may be a useful approach to guide man-\nagement efforts aimed at the detection of climate change\nrefugia (Keppel et al., 2011; Morelli et al., 2016). The present\nstudy adds to the growing body of literature suggesting that\nhydraulic traits and hydraulic safety margins, in particular,\nare a valuable set of tools for predicting the impacts of\ndrought on plant communities and that similar comparisons\nof hydraulic traits in other ecosystems may reveal additional\nhydrologic refugia important to species persistence in the face\nof a warmer, drier future.\nSupplementary material\nSupplementary material is available at Conservation Physiol-\nogy online\nAcknowledgements\nThe Catalina Island Conservancy, especially Jamie King, Peter\nDixon, Ben Coleman, Linda Farley and Sarah Ratay, provided\naccess to the island and accommodations during field research\ntrips.

First, the 20 microclimate recorded by a weather station is often quite different to that near the ground surface, where 21 many organisms live. Second, the temporal and spatial resolutions of gridded climate datasets derived 22 from weather stations are often too coarse to capture the conditions experienced by organisms. 23 Temporally and spatially coarse data have clear benefits in terms of reduced model size and complexity, 24 but here we argue that coarse-grained data introduce errors that, in biological studies, are too often 25 ignored. However, in contrast to common perception, these errors are not necessarily caused directly 26 by a spatial mismatch between the size of organisms and the scale at which climate data are collected. 27 Rather, errors and biases are primarily due to (i) systematic discrepancies between the climate used in 28 analysis and that experienced by organisms under study and (ii) the non-linearity of most biological 29 responses in combination with differences in climate variance between locations and time periods for 30 which models are fitted and those for which projections are made. We discuss when exactly problems 31 of scale can be expected to arise and highlight the potential to circumvent these by spatially and 32 temporally down-scaling climate. We also suggest ways in which adjustments to deal with issues of 33 scale could be made without the need to run high-resolution models over wide extents. 34 Introduction 35 Climate is among the most fundamental driving forces controlling the environment in which organisms 36 reside (Clarke, 2017). It sets boundaries on the biological processes fundamental to their survival and 37 reproduction, and governs the rates of processes within these boundaries. Though many ecological 38 studies account for climate variables when explaining biological phenomena, they usually rely on data 39 derived or modelled from weather stations, the spatial resolution of which is typically orders of 40 magnitude larger than the organisms under study (Potter, Arthur Woods, & Pincebourde, 2013). 41 3  Conventionally, terrestrial meteorological data are collected from networks of weather stations, with 42 variables such as temperature and humidity recorded at c.1.5-2 metres from the ground surface in 43 locations carefully selected to be unaffected by local microclimatic influences. Observations are often 44 subsequently interpolated to a grid at a resolution of 101 to 102 km (see for example World 45 Meteorological Organization, 2010). Future climate predictions from regional-scale climate models and 46 reanalyses of historical data are typically made available at a similar spatial scale. While meteorological 47 data are frequently recorded at hourly or sub-hourly intervals, summarised data are usually in the form 48 of daily, monthly or annual summary statistics. This standardised approach to data collection and 49 collation is designed to capture large-scale atmospheric phenomena for the description and prediction 50 of weather systems; the influence of very fine-scale and short-term variation is of less interest to 51 meteorologists. Data in this form are used widely by ecologists and agronomists, not least as they offer 52 simple and attractive means of modelling biological responses with comparative ease. For example, the 53 WorldClim dataset (Fick & Hijmans, 2017), used very commonly in biological studies (Gardner, 54 Maclean, & Gaston, 2019), models climate at a spatial resolution of 1 km and a temporal resolution of 55 one month (estimated over multiple years). Nevertheless, a growing literature stresses that the 56 microclimatic conditions that influence the growth, reproduction and survival of organisms in the 57 environment can vary considerably from standardised meteorological data (Bramer et al., 2018; Potter 58 et al., 2013; Suggitt et al., 2017). 59 Spatial and temporal variation in climate is greatest close to the ground and the surfaces of vegetation 60 where most organisms live (Mihalakakou, Santamouris, Lewis, & Asimakopoulos, 1997). Close to the 61 ground, or inside forests for example, most of the momentum of wind is absorbed and the air flow is 62 thus much slower, preventing the thermal mixing that evens out temperatures at the height of weather 63 stations. Consequently, there is much more spatial variation in ground temperature than is recorded at 64 weather stations (Monin & Obukhov, 1954; Oke, 2002). For example, instantaneous temperatures 65 measured a few centimetres apart just above ground (e.g. on the north and south facing sides of an 66 anthill, or within shaded areas and underneath canopy gaps in a forest), are as variable as temperature 67 differences over the extent of the UK measured using standard weather stations (Bramer et al., 2018). 68 4  Likewise, over just a few metres, surface water conditions can vary from permanently wet to 69 permanently dry (Arsenault et al., 2019).  70 In many circumstances a biologist may seek to calculate the response of an organism to climatic 71 variables and predict the response at times or locations with different climate. Such predictions can be 72 made by projecting a model calibrated at a specific time and location using climate data for new times 73 and locations. Models of this kind can be simple and correlative, for example the construction of a 74 climate envelope encompassing the current distribution of an organism (Lembrechts et al., 2019), or the 75 regression calculations establishing relationships between growth and accumulated temperature at 76 different locations (McMaster & Wilhelm 1997). More complex models might include the process-77 based crop simulation models used in agriculture (e.g. Van Diepen et al., 1989), or mechanistic 78 representations of plant growth in land surface models or dynamic vegetation models (e.g. Sitch et al., 79 2003). However, in so doing, several types of bias can arise if the resolution of climate data used is 80 excessively coarse. Firstly, biases may result from the difference between the climate experienced by 81 the organism and the climate data used in the model when this difference is not constant between 82 calibration and prediction. Secondly, biases may result from the non-linearity of the biological response 83 to climate. When climate information is spatially or temporally aggregated, a simple measure of central 84 tendency is used to summarise the data across the aggregation (e.g. the mean temperature within a 85 coarse-resolution grid cell). We show that, because a non-linear response to an averaged climate 86 variable is different from the averaged response, predictions derived at one scale do not necessarily 87 translate to those made at different scales. Moreover, even if the scale is maintained constant between 88 calibration and prediction, when the distribution of a climate variable around its mean value varies 89 between locations or over different time periods, biases may arise due to differences in the discrepancy 90 between the mean response and the response to the averaged climate data. 91 Here we describe how, why and when the use of coarse-scale climate data is problematic. First, we 92 explain exactly what the problems are. We then discuss the extent to which biological responses would 93 be expected to be non-linear and hence affected by issues of averaging and scale. We then present 94 5  specific examples of when such errors arise, to indicate the potential magnitude of the problem. We 95 conclude by demonstrating how the use of high-resolution climate data can avoid these problems, and 96 how in the absence of such data, adjustments to deal with issues of non-linearity can be made. 97 Climate and the problem of scale 98 The simplest form of error arising from coarse resolution data is the discrepancy between standard 99 meteorological measures of climate and the climatic conditions actually experienced by an organism. 100 Such discrepancies occur whenever the organism is poorly coupled to the surrounding atmospheric air 101 mass. This is the case for any organism living close to the ground, where radiative heating and cooling 102 effects affect microclimate air temperatures; for organisms in environments where latent heat exchanges 103 buffer against temperature change, including humid environments or those near bodies of water, snow 104 or ice (Campbell & Norman 2012); or for organisms in deep shade under a forest canopy (De Frenne et 105 al., 2019). It is also the case where an organism itself is influenced by radiative heating and cooling. 106 Biases in the computation of biological responses derived from these climate data can thus occur even 107 if the response is linear. 108 Additional biases occur if coarse-scale climate data are used to model non-linear biological responses. 109 The translation from fine to coarse scales is usually a form of averaging. Spatially, variables measured 110 at precise locations are assigned a value representative of a wider area (e.g. a pixel on a raster), while 111 temporally, data for a specific time period are assigned values representative of longer time intervals. 112 When considering a non-linear biological response to a particular climate variable, e.g. (\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65): \ud835\udc66 = \ud835\udc652), 113 the mean biological response is not the same as the response to the mean of the predictor, i.e. (?\u0305?2 \u2260 ?\u0305?) 114 (Fig. 1b). Consequently, if the average of a predictor variable is used in place of unaggregated variables, 115 a biased prediction would be expected. Intuitively one might expect that calibrating and predicting with 116 climate data at the same level of aggregation (e.g. monthly data at 1 km resolution) would bypass this 117 problem. However, it is often the case that the distribution of values around the mean may differ 118 between locations or time periods such that \u2211 |\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56 \u2212 ?\u0305?| \ud835\udc5b\u2044\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc56=1  is not identical. In consequence |?\u0305?2 \u2212 ?\u0305?| 119 6  will also differ between locations. This error impacts predictions made to areas or periods of novel 120 climate whenever the distribution of a climate variable represented by an average differs between 121 calibration and prediction data (Fig. 1b). Such differences are likely to be the norm rather than the 122 exception. In time, the amplitude of diurnal fluctuations in temperature are lower in coastal regions and 123 reduced by cloud cover (Dai, Trenberth, & Karl, 1999), the latter influenced by elevation. In space, 124 terrain and vegetation cover exert strong influences on heterogeneity in temperatures (Lenoir et al. 2013; 125 Suggitt et al., 2018) implying that the models calibrated in relatively flat un-forested regions, for 126 example, are not translatable to mountainous regions and/or forested regions and vice versa.  127 A more specific, but very widespread problem occurs when coarse-resolution climate data are expressed 128 in terms of accumulated \u201cforcing units\u201d or \u201cgrowing-degrees\u201d per unit time interval e.g. growing-degree 129 days. In its basic formulation (McMaster & Wilhelm, 1997), the timing of phenological events are 130 assumed to be directly related to the accumulation of forcing units, where a forcing unit is the length of 131 time for which the average temperature is above a specified threshold (T0). However, the temporal 132 resolution of the temperature data used to compute growing-degrees plays an important role. When 133 compared to Growing Degree-Hours (GDH), Growing Degree-Days (GDD) tend to underestimate the 134 time at which the study organism is exposed to temperatures greater than the threshold (Gu, 2016). This 135 is caused by the daily fluctuation of hourly temperatures around the mean. The difference between GDD 136 and GDH is greater when the mean daily temperature is close to T0. When the daily mean is just below 137 T0 no GDDs are counted, yet the warmest hours of the day will often be above T0 causing the 138 accumulation of some GDH. Conversely, when the daily mean is above T0, GDD is assumed to 139 accumulate over the entire day, yet for several hours in the day the temperature is below T0. Although 140 this phenomenon has been noticed in the past (Baker, 1980; Merrill & Peairs, 2017; Worner, 1992), it 141 is surprisingly commonly ignored (Chuine, Cambon, & Comtois, 2000; Chung, Mack, Yun, & Kim, 142 2011; Shi et al., 2017). 143 Another specific example relates to models that seek to determine the relationship between the 144 occurrence of species and climate in space and time. The premise of species distribution models is that 145 7  the coarse spatial and temporal resolution climate variables used in these models are statistically 146 meaningful predictors of probability of species occurrence (Bennie, Wilson, Maclean, & Suggitt, 2014). 147 Thus, while the variables included in these models are not necessarily assumed to affect thermal 148 performance directly, they are assumed to correlate with performance because the closer the mean 149 climate is to the thermal optima of a species, the greater the prevalence of favourable climatic conditions 150 in space and time. However, the discrepancy between the true mean thermal performance and the 151 assumed mean estimated from aggregated temperature data will vary as a function of the distribution of 152 temperature around the mean. Thus, while it is often assumed that projections derived from these models 153 may be biased because of the mismatch between the size of organisms and the scale at which climate 154 data are collected and modelled (e.g. Potter et al., 2013), this is not necessarily the case. Rather, it is the 155 non-linear relationship between occurrence probability and climate and the likelihood that spatio-156 temporal variability in climate is not constant in time and space that results in the bias.  157 These discrepancies raise three important issues. First, models calibrated with field measurements of 158 climate experienced by organisms cannot be applied using temperatures derived from weather stations 159 without introducing significant biases into the model\u2019s predictions. Second, models calibrated using 160 climatic data of one spatial or temporal resolution should not be used to derive predictions using climate 161 data of another resolution without careful consideration (and ideally testing) of the potential to introduce 162 bias under a given climate. Last, even if resolution is maintained constant between calibration and 163 prediction, when applying models across regions with different climates, and possibly even between 164 years at sites with inter-annual variation, significant biases may arise if coarse-resolution data are used 165 and the variance around the mean is not constant.  166 Non-linear biological responses 167 Many biological processes are inherently non-linear (Archontoulis & Miguez, 2015). At the most 168 fundamental level, the temperature dependence of the chemical reaction rates (the speed at which 169 reactants turn into products) is described by the Arrhenius equation, which takes the form of an 170 8  exponential function. At higher levels, many biological responses are also non-linear. In plants, for 171 example, the relationship between incident, Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) flux and \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc422 172 intake per leaf area per time unit is a positive, linear function at low PAR values but eventually reaches 173 an asymptote. Similarly, the internal net photosynthetic rate varies non-linearly with irradiance, 174 showing saturation at high levels of irradiance for varying levels of the quantum efficiency of 175 photosynthesis (Reed, Hamerly, Dinger, & Jarvis, 1976). This saturation occurs because, under 176 moderate flux densities, the photosynthetic apparatuses are capable of processing all of the incoming 177 radiation. Light saturation values are typically much below flux densities under clear-sky conditions, 178 placing fully exposed plants in the non-linear portion of the curve relatively often. In cases of excessive 179 exposure, PAR can damage the photosynthetic apparatuses, reducing CO2 fixation. Similarly, growth 180 rates also respond non-linearly to temperature, following a logistic function with exponential growth at 181 the low end of the temperature range, a linear section in the middle, and a logarithmic-type gradual 182 decrease of the growth rate at the high end of the range (Went, 1953). In consequence, models of plant 183 growth calibrated for one location or time period do not translate to others. Even in instances where 184 idealised linear biological responses are expected, non-linearity may result from Blackman\u2019s \u201claw of 185 limiting factors\u201d (Blackman, 1905). Most biological processes are limited by more than one external 186 factor. While relationships between growth and photosynthesis may be linear at low light levels, for 187 example, when light becomes abundant, CO2 becomes limiting and so the biological response becomes 188 non-linear. This idea of multiple limiting factors is often invoked as an explanation of why idealised 189 physical relationships are sometimes linear, but real biological relationships almost never are. 190 Animals too exhibit complex non-linear responses to climatic variables. At a fundamental level, the 191 thermal energy emitted by an organism increases as a function of its temperature in Kelvin to the power 192 of 4 and the latent heat release increases exponentially with temperature (Campbell, 1977; Kearney & 193 Porter, 2020; Tetens, 1930). Sensible heat loss in the form of conduction and convection increases with 194 the temperature difference between the body and the air. The body temperature of endotherms thus 195 typically increases asymptotically with air temperature and is maintained within a narrow thermal range. 196 For ectotherms, the metabolic rate will typically decrease with temperature until basal levels are 197 9  reached, but its water loss will increase exponentially (Porter & Gates, 1969). Since there are often 198 limits to the energy and water intake an organism is able to attain, the thermal performance functions 199 of organisms are usually highly non-linear, characterised by Gaussian, Beta or Wiebull functions 200 (Angilletta, 2006). Thermal performance is thus high within a definable range of ambient temperatures, 201 but declines sharply when these thresholds are exceeded. Spatially or temporally aggregated data do 202 not capture these climatic extremes and would thus be expected to over-estimate thermal performance 203 and survival (Sunday et al., 2014).  204 In addition to these passive dependencies on climate, plants and animals have also evolved more active 205 strategies to compensate for highly variable, and sometimes sub-optimal environmental conditions. In 206 plants, environmental variability impacts mainly the photosynthetic apparatus, and plants have thus 207 evolved many methods of responding to changes in their growing conditions (Walters, 2005). These 208 can manifest as long-term developmental shifts or adjustments in proteins within the photosynthetic 209 apparatus, over timescales of seconds to hours (Demmig\u2010Adams et al., 1996). To prevent thermal 210 damage, for example, plants cool down through evapotranspiration and sensible heat loss. While 211 partially controlled passively, this occurs at the stomatal level, and through biochemical processes that 212 store heat energy into the chemical bonds of molecules (such as Isoprene) that are then released into the 213 air during hot days. Thermal acclimation is also important, and thought to affect strongly coupled 214 vegetation-atmosphere feedbacks in the global carbon cycle, especially as the climate warms (Stinziano, 215 Way, & Bauerle, 2018). 216 Animals too exhibit active strategies for maintaining body temperature. The most prevalent example of 217 this is behavioural thermoregulation. Most terrestrial ectotherms are mobile and can behaviourally 218 exploit local heterogeneity in climate to regulate their body temperatures somewhat independently of 219 local environmental temperatures \u2014 the so called \u201cBogert effect\u201d (Bogert, 1949). Though the 220 physiological thermal-tolerance limits of most terrestrial ectotherms usually exceed local air 221 temperatures, their extreme operative body temperatures in exposed habitats often match or exceed 222 these thermal-tolerance limits (Sunday et al., 2014). Therefore, most ectotherms do not have a 223 10  physiological thermal-safety margin and must rely on behaviour to avoid overheating or to avoid lethal 224 cold exposure (Sunday et al., 2014). In consequence, their biological responses are unlikely to change 225 linearly with ambient conditions. 226 Thus, fundamental mechanisms driving chemical reactions, the exchange of heat between organisms 227 and their environment, and the growth, development and survival of organisms vary non-linearly with 228 respect to temperature and other climate variables. It is therefore better to assume non-linearity 229 whenever there is no evidence to the contrary, and many of the issues raised in this paper are likely to 230 be quite universal.  231 Applied examples 232 To illustrate the potential magnitude of errors associated with non-linear biological responses and scale, 233 we provide two examples. In the first example GDD and GDH were calculated at multiple heights above 234 ground, and at various spatial resolutions using the microclimate model of Maclean et al., (2019). The 235 model was applied to derive temperatures at a grid resolution of 1 m over a 200 m by 200 m region of 236 the Lizard Peninsula in Cornwall, UK (49.97\u00b0N, 5.22\u00b0W). To test the importance of \u201cheight above 237 ground\u201d, GDH (base 10\u00b0C) for the period 1st Jan to 20th April 2017 were calculated from temperatures 238 at hourly intervals at heights of 2, 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 cm from the ground. It can be seen that the rate 239 of increase in GDH, here for a flat surface in the centre of the study location, is much faster for 240 temperatures near the ground (Fig. 2b). For example, temperatures at 2 cm above ground reach a GDH 241 threshold value of 1500 on 2nd April, in contrast to temperatures 100 cm above ground, which reached 242 the same threshold on 28th April, almost a month later. Though night-time temperatures are significantly 243 colder near the ground (Maclean et al., 2019), this is more than compensated for by warmer daytime 244 temperatures. Thus, the timing of phenological events for organisms living close to the ground could 245 potentially be underestimated significantly if ambient air temperatures are used, and likewise models 246 fitted using GDH/24 cannot be applied with daily data and vice-versa. To test the importance of the 247 time-interval used, we compared estimates of GDH/24 with those of GDD for the same location and 248 11  period (5 cm above ground on a south-facing slope, Fig. 2c, and across the entire study region, Fig. 2i). 249 The discrepancy was marked. The GDD estimate for the 30th of April was less than half the estimate 250 derived by computing GDH/24. To test the effects of spatial resolution, we computed GDH/24 at grid 251 resolutions of 5 m and 25 m using two approaches. In the first, the input climate data were coarsened, 252 whereas in the second, we instead coarsened the cumulative degree-hour estimates (Fig. 2e-h). While 253 at 5 m resolution only minor discrepancies were evident, at 25 m grid resolution the discrepancies were 254 marked. When the input temperature data were averaged, spatial variation in GDH/24 was generally 255 lower, and locations with low and high values of GDH/24 do not necessary correspond. Cleary scale is 256 important in the estimation of GDH, and both the locations and timings of phenological events may be 257 misrepresented when coarse spatial or temporal data are used.  258 In the second example, we used a slightly simplified version of the microclimate and general ectotherm 259 models of Kearney & Porter (2017, 2020) to estimate the operative body temperature, water loss and 260 activity budget of a the great desert skink Liopholis kintorei at a location in Northern Territory, Australia 261 (23.71\u00b0S, 129.93\u00b0E) using hourly and daily climate forcing data to run the model as described in 262 Kearney et al., (2019). The conventional model includes a suite of programs for the mechanistic 263 modelling of heat, water, energy and mass exchange between an organism and its environment over its 264 entire life cycle, which in turn, based on body temperature and energy and water demands, can be used 265 to predict behaviour. In our simplified version of the model, it was assumed that the skink would bask 266 if body temperatures do not exceed an upper thermal tolerance threshold of 45\u00b0C irrespective of energy 267 requirements, but would retreat to burrows to seek shade if the body temperature exceeded this 268 temperature. It was also assumed that a skink would retreat to burrows if the body temperature 269 potentially attained in a burrow exceeded that which would be attained when basking in the open if 270 below this upper thermal threshold, such as would be expected to occur at night (Fig. 3b). When 271 estimated using hourly climate data, both mean daily body temperature (Fig. 3c) and water loss (Fig. 272 3f) were generally higher than when estimated using daily climate data. There were also marked 273 differences is in the prediction of behaviour (Fig. 3d). Whereas the daily model predicted that skinks 274 would spend almost all of their time basking as the upper critical threshold was not reached, and average 275 12  daily body temperature over 24 hours in open areas was higher than that which would have been attained 276 in burrows, the hourly model predicted that skinks would spend their time basking during daylight hours 277 only, except during the hottest periods of the day. Thus, even minor biases in the estimation of body 278 temperatures, caused by non-linearity and temporal averaging can have a marked outcome on a 279 predicted behavioural response.  280 Obtaining high-resolution climate data 281 Clearly, many of the issues of scale and non-linearity can be resolved through the use of higher 282 resolution climate data, but in practical terms such data are not always readily available. Nevertheless, 283 the issue of lack of high temporal resolution data is relatively easy to address. Sub-daily modelled 284 estimates of historic climate have recently become available at ~30 km grid resolution through the 285 ERA5 Atmospheric Reanalysis Project (Albergel et al., 2018). While it is inherently impossible to 286 predict the precise climate conditions at some date and time in the distant future, reliable methods for 287 generating synthetic time series of sub-daily or daily weather, using weather generators, are also 288 increasingly available (e.g. Ailliot, Allard, Monbet, & Naveau, 2015). Interpolating these data to high 289 temporal resolution is also comparatively straightforward. Simple approaches that replicate diurnal 290 temperature cycles by fitting two terms of a Fourier series have been widely used for decades (e.g. 291 Campbell, 1977). More complex approaches entail modelling the departure from these idealised diurnal 292 cycles by using proxy data from alternative sources such as nearby weather stations (Luedeling 2018) 293 or estimates of cloud cover and solar radiation (Maclean et al., 2019), but can also be applied easily. In 294 so doing, it is also worth remembering that certain processes, such as photosynthesis, occur only during 295 daylight hours. It is therefore important to use climate measurements that are time-restricted to the 296 relevant periods. 297 The issue of spatial resolution is more problematic than temporal resolution, though a paradigm shift in 298 the ability of the scientific community to address this issue is occurring (Lembrechts & Lenoir, 2019). 299 Global efforts to obtain measurements of high-resolution soil temperatures are already underway 300 13  (Lembrechts et al., 2020b) and at its simplest, coarse spatial resolution data can be downscaled using 301 spatial interpolation techniques (e.g. Wahba, 1990) or multivariate regression (e.g. Greiser, Meineri, 302 Luoto, Ehrl\u00e9n, & Hylander, 2018). Such approaches are relatively effective at capturing mesoclimatic 303 variation, but suffer from some of the same issues associating with non-linearity, in that the 304 environmental determinants of differences between coarse- and fine-resolution climates may not be 305 constant in time and space. For this reason, there has been a concerted effort to develop more 306 mechanistic approaches. These approaches, which build on the pioneering applications of physics to 307 biology (Monin & Obukhov, 1954; Monteith, 1973; Penman, 1948), now permit both historic and future 308 microclimate conditions to be computed anywhere on earth using freely available climate and 309 environmental data (Kearney et al., 2019; Kearney & Porter, 2017; Maclean, 2019).  310 It is also worth reemphasising that a key source of the discrepancy between the conditions experienced 311 by organisms, the temperature of the organism itself, and that of a weather station is the height above 312 the ground at which the organism lives. Both spatial and temporal heterogeneity in temperature, and 313 deviations from measurements made by weather stations, are most pronounced immediately above the 314 ground. For this reason, it is important to consider the height at which temperature is measured or 315 modelled relative to that of the organism under study. While microclimate models permit users to 316 specify the height at which temperature is required, they are most suited to modelling conditions 317 immediately above or below a vegetated surface, but not within a canopy itself (Bramer et al., 2018).  318 Furthermore, in the context of within-canopy temperatures, it is worth considering the dynamic 319 feedbacks between climate and canopy cover. Understory microclimate is influenced strongly by 320 vegetative shading, yet the degree of shading itself varies throughout the year, partly in response to 321 changing climatic conditions. This is of particular importance during spring and autumn, when leaf 322 flushing, colouration and abscission change most rapidly, altering radiation transmission though the 323 canopy and consequently understory microclimate (Villegas, Breshears, Zou, & Royer, 2010). 324 At what resolution are data needed? 325 14  A key question then is at what spatial resolution are climate data needed in order to avoid erroneous 326 predictions of biological responses to climate? Potter et al. (2013) show that grid lengths in species 327 distribution models are, on average, ~104\u2010fold larger than the animals they study. Though many 328 organisms are mobile, their temperatures are determined by heat fluxes operating on their body, 329 averaged over time periods that scale proportionally to their thermal mass (Porter, Mitchell, Beckman, 330 & DeWitt, 1973). However, the relationships between body temperature and air temperature are non-331 linear (Porter & Gates, 1969), so it is not the case that body temperatures scale simply with the average 332 of the air temperature over the region that they roam. Moreover, many mobile organisms exhibit 333 thermoregulatory behaviour such as basking, and therefore show strong preferences for particular 334 microclimates within the landscape (Barton, Porter, & Kearney, 2014). At face value, the implication 335 that there is a need to model temperatures at spatial resolutions that match the body size of organisms 336 is worrying, as spatially explicit and accurate representation of global- or continental-extent climate at 337 a resolution of a few centimetres to metres is impractical, even with rapid advances in computer 338 processing power and fine spatial resolution remote sensing data, particularly if fine temporal-resolution 339 data are also needed. However, we argue that explicit knowledge of climatic conditions at resolutions 340 that match the body size of organisms are not necessarily needed. Instead we suggest that knowledge 341 of the likely spatial and temporal distribution of climatic variables around the mean is more important. 342 This in turn allows simulation of the range of conditions experienced by organisms (cf. Lembrechts et 343 al., 2020a), which by using principles of biophysical ecology, provide direct mechanistic insight into 344 the physiological responses and constraints and hence of thermal performance (Kearney & Porter 2009).  345 While it is commonly perceived that climate exerts influence on species primarily at coarser scales, and 346 that fine-scale factors such resource availability and biotic interactions are more important (Pearson and 347 Dawson 2003), it remains the case that organisms are most directly influenced by the climatic conditions 348 they experience. Associations with climate at coarser scales results primarily because such data serve 349 as proxies for the spatial and temporal variations in the microclimate that influence individual 350 performance (Bennie et al., 2014; Gardner et al 2019). However, organisms are most directly connected 351 to climatic conditions through exchanges of energy and mass (Porter & Gates 1969). With estimates of 352 15  the mean and range of conditions directly experienced by organisms it is possible to use principles of 353 thermodynamics to derive mechanistic models of these processes and their physiological consequences 354 (Kearney & Porter, 2009). Moreover, sophisticated models are now emerging to infer biotic interactions 355 from species distribution data, but spatial scale remains one of the major challenges as biotic 356 interactions almost invariably occur at finer spatial resolutions than those for which we have climate 357 data (Ara\u00fajo & Rozenfeld 2014). A potential solution to problems of scale is thus judicious sub-358 sampling. Here, instead of attempting to model climate at fine spatial and temporal resolution over wide 359 regions, fine resolution climate data are derived at sample locations and time-periods that best represent 360 how organisms use their environment. Such data could then either be used to simulate the direct 361 physiological responses mechanistically, or used in place of conventional climate data when using a 362 statistical approach by Monte Carlo simulation.  363 Conclusion 364 Many biological phenomena are studied using coarse spatial and temporal resolution climate data, but 365 doing so introduces errors for at least two reasons. Firstly, because there may be systematic differences 366 between the climate experienced by organisms and that measured by weather stations, and, secondly, 367 because many responses to climate are non-linear, and the mean biological response is not the same as 368 the response to the mean climate. Such errors are likely to be particularly pronounced when models are 369 calibrated and projected in very different environments, such as calibrated in a lab and then applied in 370 the field, but may manifest in any situation in which a model is projected to new time periods or 371 locations. Most biological responses are inherently non-linear, and in the absence of evidence to the 372 contrary it is thus safer to assume non-linearity. The problem of scale is likely to be much more 373 ubiquitous than is commonly appreciated. We thus urge biologists to give greater consideration to this 374 issue. Methods for downscaling climate to finer spatial and temporal resolution are now readily 375 available and provide the tools by which to do so.  376 16  Acknowledgements 377 The work underpinning this paper was supported through the Agri-tech Cornwall & the Isles of Scilly 378 Project, part-funded by the European Regional Development Fund, Cornwall Council and the Council 379 for the Isles of Scilly (award number: 05R16P00366).

In (a) a hypothetical linear biological response given by  551 0.5\u00b7Temperature + 5 is shown. Here the mean response and response to mean temperature are identical. In 552 (b) a hypothetical non-linear biological response to temperatures in the range 0-10, given by response = 553 temperature2 is shown. Here, the mean response (solid horizontal line) is not the same as mean of 554 temperature2 (dashed horizontal line). In (c) a hypothetical biological response given by 0.1 x temperature2 555 is shown for two temperature datasets with different means and distributions, but identical sample sizes. The 556 difference between the mean response (solid horizontal lines) and 0.1 x the mean of temperature2 (dashed 557 horizontal lines) differs between the two datasets, demonstrating that when models are fitted using 558 aggregated data and then projected to new locations or different time periods, errors will result unless the 559 distribution of data around the mean remains identical.  560  561 Fig. 2. Effects of height above ground and resolution on the derivation of growing-degree days (GDD) and 562 hours (GDH) on the Lizard Peninsula in the south-west of the United Kingdom (a). The microclimate model 563 of Maclean et al. (2019) was used to derive temperatures at multiple heights in April 2017 for a 200 m by 564 200 m location in Cornwall, UK (49.97\u00b0N, 5.22\u00b0W). In (b) GDH/24 (base 10\u00b0C) was calculated for 565 temperatures at various heights above ground. In (c) comparisons between GDH/24 and GDD are shown as 566 a function of time (south-facing slope, 5 cm above ground). In (d) spatial variability in GDH/24, modelled 567 at 1 m grid resolution (5 cm above ground) is shown. In (e-h) the effects of spatial coarsening are shown. 568 GDH/24 at 5 cm above ground was derived at 5 m (e, f) and 25 m (g, h) resolution using two methods: first 569 by coarsening the input temperature data (e, g) and second by coarsening the output growing-degree 570 estimates (f, h). In (i) spatial differences in GDH/24 and GDD on 30th April (5 cm above ground) are shown. 571 The colour scale is the same for figures d-h, as depicted by the colour bar to the right of (f).  572  573 Fig. 3. Body temperature, water loss and activity budget of the great desert skink Liopholis kintorei in Nov-574 Dec 2019 calculated using a simplified version of the general ectotherm model of Kearney et al. (2020) for 575 a location in central Australia (a, 23.71\u00b0S, 129.93\u00b0E). In (b) temperatures were modelled at hourly intervals 576 and it was assumed the skink will bask if body temperatures (green) did not exceed an upper thermal 577 tolerance threshold of 45\u00b0C, and body temperature was calculated as the operative body temperature (grey). 578 If temperatures exceed this threshold, or the body temperature that would be attained in burrows was higher 579 than would be attained by basking, it was assumed that the skink underwent thermoregulatory behaviour and 580 sought refuge in burrows and the body temperature equilibrates with the temperature of the burrow (purple).  581 In (c) mean daily body temperature is shown derived by averaging the inputs (purple) and outputs (green) 582 demonstrating that body temperatures were typically estimated to be warmer when outputs were averaged. 583 In (d) the cumulative basking time is shown, indicating that when inputs were averaged, the predicted humid 584 operative temperature was usually warmer than burrow temperatures, but colder than the upper critical 585 threshold of 45\u00b0C and was therefore predicted to bask over the entire 24 period, whereas hourly data 586 predicted basking behaviour only for part of the day. In (e) hourly water loss with (blue) and without (grey) 587 thermoregulatory behaviour are shown, and in (f) daily water loss calculated by averaging the inputs (purple) 588 and outputs (green) are shown. In (c) and (f) thermoregulatory behaviour was assumed.  589 ",

    "abstract": "Climate change is negatively affecting ecosystems around the world, and in the coming years, scientists predict that these changes will only intensify and accelerate. In the western mountains of North America, climate change projections predict elevated temperatures, reduced snowpack, and earlier snowmelt. Elevated air temperatures have the propensity to affect water temperatures in sensitive freshwater ecosystems. Temperature increases may cause streams to reach the upper thermal limit for many aquatic organisms, such as aquatic invertebrates and fish, and result in death or dispersal for these organisms. This makes the availability of cold-water refugia in streams that much more important for these organisms. Changes in water temperature also influence water quality and have the potential to shape communities of aquatic organisms. Our objective is to examine the relationship between climate and seasonal thermal regimes in a high desert stream located in western Colorado. Climate and water temperature data has simultaneously been collected along Kimball Creek from 2011 to 2017 in riffle habitats and beaver ponds. We predict that air and water temperatures will be positively correlated and that beaver ponds, located within the stream, will have cooler water temperatures and potentially serve as refugia for thermally sensitive species",

This makes the \navailability of cold-water refugia in streams that much more important for these organisms. \nChanges in water temperature also influence water quality and have the potential to shape \ncommunities of aquatic organisms. Our objective is to examine the relationship between \nclimate and seasonal thermal regimes in a high desert stream located in western Colorado. \nClimate and water temperature data has simultaneously been collected along Kimball Creek \nfrom 2011 to 2017 in riffle habitats and beaver ponds. We predict that air and water \ntemperatures will be positively correlated and that beaver ponds, located within the stream, \nwill have cooler water temperatures and potentially serve as refugia for thermally sensitive \nspecies.  \n",
