Rios\nStranded Assets: A Climate Risk Challenge2\nWhat Are Stranded Assets?\nStranded assets are defined as assets that have suffered from unantici-\npated or premature write-downs, devaluations, or conversion to liabilities \n(Caldecott, Howarth, and McSharry, 2013). Environment-related risks that \ncan cause asset stranding include:\n\u2022 Environmental challenges (e.g., climate change, natural capital deg-\nradation)\n\u2022 Changing resource landscapes (e.g., shale gas abundance, phos-\nphate scarcity)\n\u2022 New government regulations (e.g., carbon pricing, air pollution regu-\nlation)\n\u2022 Falling clean technology costs (e.g., solar photovoltaic, onshore \nwind, electric vehicles)\n\u2022 Evolving social norms (e.g., fossil fuel divestment campaigns) and \nconsumer behavior (e.g., certification schemes)\n\u2022 Litigation (e.g., carbon liability) and changing statutory interpreta-\ntions (e.g., fiduciary duty, disclosure requirements)\nFocus on these risks has been accelerated by a wide range of support \nfrom a variety of significant international figures.1 In addition, research on \nthe topic of \u201cunburnable carbon,\u201d which is strongly linked to the concept of \nstranded assets, has sparked one of the fastest-growing social movements \nin history \u2013 the fossil fuel free divestment campaign. The campaign may not \nhave a direct impact on company share value, but indirect impacts are likely \nto occur as a result of uncertainty and stigmatization affecting staff recruit-\nment and retention, brand value, and the ability of stigmatized firms to influ-\nence policy (Ansar, Tilbury, and Caldecott, 2013). The divestment campaign \nhas also contributed to an increase in support for shareholder resolutions \nthat require greater disclosure from large listed fossil fuel companies.  \n1 Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, became one of the most recent major figures to endorse \nthis focus in a speech at Lloyd\u2019s of London on September 29, 2015 (Carney, 2015). Others have included U.S. \nPresident Barack Obama; UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon; Jim Kim, President of the World Bank; Christiana \nFigueres, Executive Secretary of the \u00a0United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; Angel Gurr\u00eda, \nSecretary-General of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development; Lord Stern of Brentford; \nand Ben van Beurden, CEO of Shell plc.\nStranded Assets: A Climate Risk Challenge 3\nWhy Do Stranded Assets Matter?  \nStranded assets are not just the result of climate change, and they involve \nsectors other than fossil fuels. Stranded assets are not considered a new \nphenomenon, but many interviewees expect that stranding will increase in \nthe coming decades as a result of environmental and technological chang-\nes. Asked to rank the factors that will strand assets in the future, falling \nclean technology costs and physical environmental change were identified \nas the most likely. \nInterviewees focused on the temporal aspect of stranding, noting that some \nassets will be stranded permanently, while others will only be temporarily \naffected by extreme weather or changing prices. Fossil fuels were seen as \nthe sector most likely to be affected by stranding. However, other sectors \nwere also highlighted as being at risk. Infrastructure (including transport, \nports, and inefficient buildings), agriculture, real estate, mining, and utilities \nwere all highlighted as being potentially affected by asset stranding. \nRecent estimates suggest that 60 to 80 percent of publicly listed fossil fuel \nreserves must be considered \u201cunburnable\u201d if the world is to avoid disastrous \nclimate change, potentially costing the fossil fuel industry $28 trillion in rev-\nenues over the next two decades (Carbon Tracker, 2013a; Kepler Cheu-\nvreux, 2014). This would likely be reflected in lower share prices, but could \npotentially lead to financial instability as a result of significant economic \nlosses.  However, if these unburnable fossil fuel reserves were to be burnt, \nthe outcomes could be even worse, with subsequent climate change irrevo-\ncably altering the environment and affecting economic production as well as \ninvestment risk and returns (IPCC, 2014). Recent discussions of stranded \nassets are now moving beyond the \u201ccarbon bubble\u201d and \u201cunburnable car-\nbon\u201d and focusing more on how a wider range of environment-related politi-\ncal, economic, and social factors could affect asset values and stranded as-\nsets. Regardless of government policies, stranding can occur for a variety \nof reasons  including the downward cost curve for renewables, pressure \nfrom investors, and pressure from students (Murray, 2015) . \nSovereign debt could be at risk for economies that are climate-sensitive \neither through direct physical climate risks (such as storms or drought) or \nthrough overexposure to the fossil fuel sector (i.e. countries with large state-\nowned resources companies). \nInvestors \u2013 both asset owners and asset managers \u2013 are coming under \nincreasing pressure to measure and disclose their exposure to stranded-\nasset risk. The interview process revealed that some investors have begun \nto explore this exposure in-depth and are taking steps to reduce their ex-\nposure. For asset managers, there is growing pressure to offer low-carbon \nStranded Assets: A Climate Risk Challenge4\nproducts, including divestment and carbon footprinting tools. As a result, \nmany fund managers are now offering equity strategies with a low-carbon \ntilt. However, interviewees noted that few tools were readily available to \nreduce stranding risk for other asset classes. \nThe survey also highlighted the absence of climate risk management strat-\negies. The survey showed that 73 percent of participants did not have (or \ndid not know) someone in their investment/financial organization responsible \nfor ensuring that relevant climate risks had been considered. Nevertheless, \nsurvey respondents did use a variety of management tools \u2013 most notably \nnegative and positive screening, although the non-use of tools remains high. \nThe survey found that only 20 percent of respondents believe there is \nadequate information to properly analyze corporate exposure to climate \nchange. Providing management tools and strategies suitable for a wide \nrange of investors of different sizes, asset class focuses, and geographies \nis important, but so is the ease of use of the tools.\nMany financial institutions in LAC are mainly concerned with the economic \ngrowth and governance of the companies in which they are invested, and \nless so about environmental issues. Indigenous communities\u2019 rights and \nthreats to a company\u2019s social license to operate are on the radar of financial \ninstitutions, and are currently considered more salient than issues such as \nstranded assets. Pension funds across the region tend to be more recep-\ntive to the impact of climate change and stranded assets on their portfolios \ngiven their long-term mandates. The consideration of environmental issues \nhas gained more traction with financial industry associations across the re-\ngion (e.g., the Brazilian Federation of Banks). Interviewees also pointed \nto the role of central banks, providing the example of the Brazilian central \nbank, which has a mandate to encourage all financial institutions to develop \nenvironmental, social, and governance risk management practices and pro-\ncesses, which it then judges in terms of whether they are fit for purpose. \nThe size of financial markets and the ownership of pension funds in LAC are \nimportant in determining the adoption of responsible investment principles \nacross the investment value chain. Pension funds in LAC (particularly Chile \nand Peru) tend to be owned by international financial institutions, which \nhave yet to deploy their responsible investment experience in the region \neven though on the global investment landscape they are considered lead-\ners in responsible investment integration in decision-making. \nThe survey and interviews highlighted the ongoing shift toward greater \nawareness of stranded assets and broader climate consideration among \nfinancial communities internationally. However, interviewees based in Eu-\nrope, the United States, and Australia showed greater urgency and appetite \nfor integrating these issues than did interviewees in LAC, for whom issues \nof economic growth and governance were greater priorities. \nStranded Assets: A Climate Risk Challenge 5\nConclusions \nStranded assets resulting from environment-related risk factors, including \nthe effects of physical climate change and societal and regulatory respons-\nes to climate change, have become increasingly prominent. This has been \ndriven in large part by changes in the real economy (e.g., the falling cost of \nrenewables), as well as by the attention generated by the Paris Agreement. \nLevels of awareness and interest differ across countries and regions. Much \nof the early work on stranded assets originated in the United Kingdom, rap-\nidly spreading to the United States and from there to other countries. There \nis currently significantly more awareness of stranded assets among finan-\ncial institutions in the United States, Europe (particularly the United King-\ndom, France, Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, and Norway), China, and \nAustralia than elsewhere. \nWhile awareness of stranded assets among financial institutions has in-\ncreased rapidly, developments in practice have not kept up. New products \nand tools have been launched to cater to new demand, but they are often \nbased on carbon footprinting and related methodologies that financial insti-\ntutions are increasingly questioning. There are growing calls for a new gen-\neration of data, analytical methods, and tools to help financial institutions \ndifferentiate between assets and companies that are more or less exposed \nto environment-related risks. Developing this next generation of analytics \nis critically important if financial institutions are to take account of environ-\nment-related risks that can strand assets through their decision-making. \nUnderstanding the implications of stranded assets for successful low-car-\nbon development is in an incipient phase. There has been some work on \nthe need for a \u201cjust transition,\u201d but this has been relatively high-level work \nthat pre-dates much of the discourse on stranded assets. There is very little \nwork looking at how to systematically identify assets that could be stranded \nby decarbonization in order to develop policy responses that can preempt \ndestabilizing opposition that might result. There are significant opportunities \nto create tools to help policymakers understand when and where assets \nmay become stranded, in turn enabling them to develop adequate policy \nand regulatory responses. There is an opportunity for pioneering work in \nthis field in LAC.\nStranded assets could be a systemic risk to financial stability and should \ntherefore be a topic of concern for central banks and financial regulators. \nThere are also issues related to macro and microprudential regulation and \nthe conduct and practices of financial institutions that make stranded as-\nsets of relevance to supervisory bodies. Much of the work in this area has \nbeen led by the Bank of England, with the Financial Stability Board and the \nStranded Assets: A Climate Risk Challenge6\nEuropean Systemic Risk Board also producing work. Other central banks \nare likely to follow suit. There could be opportunities for LAC regulators \nto pioneer developments in this area, particularly given that the Brazilian \ncentral bank has a progressive mandate to encourage all financial institu-\ntions to develop environmental, social, and governance risk management \npractices and processes.\nGreater attention to framing and diffusing risks and opportunities, and to \nproviding diverse but practical management tools, is needed to support the \nuptake of responses to stranded assets. This is particularly the case in LAC, \nwhere other factors such as governance and development issues vie for \nprimacy among investment priorities, and where there are more limited op-\nportunities for sustainable options in the smaller financial markets. \nCopyright \u00a9 2016 Inter-American Development Bank.

Others \nprefer the talk about damaging fluctuations that are not perfectly predictable (Sinha and \nLipton 1999). Both definitions allow to point out that households can have a priori some \nsense of the likelihood of events occurring (i.e., can attach a probability distribution to risk \nevents), without really having any direct control over them (i.e., they are not perfectly certain \nthat will occur in any given future).\n1 Some authors find useful to make a distinction between \nrisk and shocks as well implying that shocks go one step further in the definition of risks. \nThey are defined as realizations of highly unexpected events that cause welfare losses. In \nother words, risks are prospects of a shock or, alternatively, shocks can be thought as the \nrealization of risks (Fafchamps 2004; Sinha and Lipton 1999). According to Sinha and Lipton \n(1999) the term \u2018shocks\u2019 has already a very specific connotation that encompasses: i) \nunexpectedness (i.e. the risky damaging fluctuation already happened, though it had low ex-\nante probability); ii) size, iii) high damage due to concentration on persons with high \nvulnerability and low resilience; iv) exogenousness in the source; and v) physical or \npsychological strain to one or more individuals due to that stress. Thus, the term climate \nshock would already cover what the disaster literature considers to be a natural disaster: those \nevents that outstrip the capacity of a society to cope with it (Anderson, 2000). This note \nmostly refers to natural disasters as climate shocks. \nHousehold assets are the stock of wealth used to generate wellbeing (Siegel and \nAlwang 1999). They are usually divided into tangible and intangible. In the first case, they \ndesign things such as natural, human, physical and financial capitals. More specifically, \nhuman capital alludes to the household member\u2019s education and their health status. Physical \ncapital is associated with productive assets such as land, tools, equipment and work animals, \nand with household assets such as housing and household services, or stocks such as \nlivestock, food and jewelry. Finally, financial capital will refer to cash, savings, and access to \ncredit. Intangible assets result from the interaction of members within households as well as \nfrom households with each other inside the community and beyond. These include gender \nrelations, social ties and networks, including participation in associations and organizations, \nand intra-household relations. Households and communities can strengthen linkages with \nother communities participating in regional politics, marriage and migration, but also being \npart of inclusive political systems and markets (Siegel and Alwang 1999). And finally, at the \ncommunity and extra-community level physical, environmental and social infrastructure \nremains fundamental, such as the existence of schools and clinics, forests and rivers and \ncommunication infrastructure. \nTo assess the impact of climate shocks on household assets one can rely on the \nconcepts of sensitivity and resilience. The former refers to the magnitude of a system\u2019s \nresponse to an external event or, in other words, the extent to which a household\u2019s asset base \nis likely to resist or not (following responses to) a shock given the intensity with which it was \nexperienced. The later refers to the ease and rapidity of a system\u2019s recovery from stress or, in \nother words, the household\u2019s ability to resist negative shocks and to recover from them \n(Bayliss-Smith 1991; Davies 1996). More than identifying both dimensions in particular \nshocks, the HDR team is interested in the implications they could have for the analysis of \nclimate shocks on assets. The extent to which a household is sensitive to a climate shock is \nobviously determined by its characteristics of the shock itself -most notably its covariate \nnature and the length, frequency and severity with which hits- and by the assets it has at hand \nto cushion the impact of the shock. The resilience of a household has a straight connection \nwith the strategies employed by households to manage risks. This means that not only the \ntype of natural disaster that people face, but also how they call on their assets in times of \nstress can have important implications for their future livelihoods. In other words, the \nmethods of using assets to relieve the pressures of a shock after it occurs (i.e., the coping  \n \n2\nstrategies) will have important implications for their ability to \u2018bounce back\u2019 to their pre-\nshock asset levels. \n \nChannels of impact \nThe physical contact of climate shocks with humans and/or with property can bring death, \ninjury, disruption of socio-economic activities and damage or destruction to property and \nnatural resources and other physical assets. Since some of these assets can be transformed into \nincome-enhancing productive activities to entitle households to goods and services that \nprovide access to different dimensions of wellbeing, including consumption, nutrition, and \nhealth, their depletion can lead into short-term welfare fluctuations and push people into \nsudden poverty.  \nMore importantly, the capacity of households to lift- stay out of poverty could be \nfurther compromised by climate shocks in the long-range. This could happen in two broad \nways. In the short-run environmental factors such as flooding, storms or drought may cause \nthe physical extinction of some assets, but access to public or private sources of recovery \nwould prevent any worsening of this impact. If households have restricted means to protect \nthe most vulnerable members inside them, such as the children under 3, shocks can have long-\nlasting effects on them through nutrition shortfalls that in turn could affect their human \ndevelopment later in life. In addition, if households have few means to react to natural \ndisasters they can end up adopting strategies with high costs in the future, such as dropping \nchildren from school or depleting their few available productive assets. Furthermore, even \nwhen adequate mechanisms to mitigate and cope with shocks are in place their application \ncan further compromise food security, human development, and growth prospects if the \nclimate shocks persist over several years in a row or the covariate nature of the problem is not \nwell understood: the value of assets could drop if all affected household try to sell them at \nonce. Finally, the inability of households to hold to their meagre asset bases in the presence of \nclimate shocks will most likely end up affecting their asset recovery efforts too as they exit \nthe shocks with few assets left. Therefore, special attention should be devoted to poor \npopulations across developed and developing countries whose assets are scarce and whose \naccess to credit and insurance markets is restricted. \nThis connects with the second and often much less explored channel through which \nclimate shocks can affect assets. This happens before the shock actually takes place and is \nexplained through the existence of risk aversion motivations combined with a limited number \nof assets - including liquidity constraints and restricted access to insurance markets \u2013 that cast \na shadow over the household perspectives for dealing with the consequences of a climate \nshock. This scenario would be conducive to the adoption of suboptimal asset portfolios for \norganizing a livelihood where the value and productivity of assets declines.  \nIn short, climate shocks can affect assets in many ways. First, through the impact on \ntheir amount, value and productivity. This could be the direct result from the shock or a \nramification of its impact through the absence or inadequate application of coping \nmechanisms. Poor households tend to pay a higher cost for mitigating and coping with risk \ndue to their reduced asset base. This is reflected in the human capital of its members, \nparticularly the children, and the forced disposal of physical assets; in addition, any asset \nrecovery efforts are more difficult to achieve. The same attributes of value and productivity \nare likely to be affected before climate shocks occur as households reallocate assets in \nresponse to risk exposure (asset portfolio influences a household\u2019s risk attitudes). For \ninstance, households with higher physical and human capital endowments, tend to be less risk \naverse, more efficient in resource allocation, and better situated to handle risk-related losses. \nIn contrast, poorer households tend to adopt risk management strategies that concentrate in \nlower risk and lower return assets, which can lead to poverty traps. \nMost disasters occur in poor countries and the people who bear the brunt of them are \nusually those who are poor (World Bank 2000). This is true in at least two senses: first, \nnatural disasters are more frequent in developing countries, and second, the poor are more \nlikely to suffer damages from natural hazards as usually they can only afford to live in \nmarginal areas and have a limited ability to manage these risks.\n2 For instance, people in low- \n \n3\nincome countries are four times as likely as people in high-income countries to die in a \nnatural disaster (World Bank 2000). Hence, this review is mostly concerned with the \nempirical evidence across poor populations in the developing world.  \n \nSENSITIVITY \nClimate shocks have immediate effects on assets \nWealth can be substantially damaged by the occurrence of extreme climate events, such as \nfloods, droughts, hurricanes and other weather-related shocks. Most obviously, there are \n\u2018direct\u2019 impacts caused by physical contact of these hazardous events with humans and/or \nwith property that result in death, injury, disruption of socio-economic activities and damage \nor destruction to property and natural resources and other physical assets. \nThe injuries, disabilities and loss of life occasioned by natural disasters is by far the \nmost notable impact on any livelihood and its assets, particularly if this involves the \nbreadwinner or any other working-age members. This is so because the poor tend to lack \nmaterial assets, and thus labour in all its forms, including formal wage employment, informal \nwork for cash, unpaid labour and subsistence production, remains the most important resource \nthat they have to face vulnerability. In that sense, the devastating impacts of Hurricane Mitch \nraging over Central America in 1998 and the tsunami disaster in the Indian Ocean in \nDecember 2004 are well captured by their respective death tolls: 10,000 people killed and \nthree million homeless, mostly from flood-related disasters in Honduras and Nicaragua, and \nover 200,000 lives and more than 1.5 million people homeless in the tsunami affected \ncountries (World Bank 2005).  \nIf assets are considered intrinsically valuable, then when climate shocks hit human \ncapital that may also push people into current poverty. Here human capital assets, in \nparticular health, become an extra category to the multidimensionality of poverty just as it \nhappens with low levels of consumption or income. For instance, substantial increases in \nillness followed the 1998 floods in Bangladesh even after the floodwaters had receded \npartially or totally: in a sample of 757 households obtained from a multi-round survey in \nseven flood-affected areas 9.6 percent of individuals suffered from diarrhoea, and 4.7 percent \nwere affected by respiratory illness in the immediate post-shock period (Del Ninno et al. \n2001). \nFinally, the reduction or extinction of physical assets due to climate shocks is a third \nimpact that becomes immediately visible, both at the household and communal level. Take as \nan example the floods in Bangladesh in 1998, which inundated two-thirds of the country for \nan unprecedented 11 weeks starting in July damaging an estimated 15,000 kilometres of \nroads, 14,000 schools, and thousands of bridges and culverts affecting their externalities and \npublic good attributes. Besides public infrastructure, the floods damaged over 500,000 homes, \nproduction, and productive inputs, and significantly altered agricultural patterns and lowered \nfarming yields (Narayan et al. 2000). All this can lead to short-term fluctuations in well-being \nas physical assets are usually combined with other forms of capital and transformed into \nincome-generating activities or activities that entitle households to goods and services that \nprovide access to different dimensions of wellbeing, including as consumption, nutrition, and \nhealth.  \nBecause most assets are stocks \u2013as opposed to income and consumption flows- and \nthe poor usually report more difficulties to recover from disruptions as explained below, the \nrest of this note concentrates on the extent to which the loss of wealth for deprived sectors of \nthe population could compromise their health and socio-economic development in the \nmedium to long-run.  \n \nBut can also have long-lasting effects\u2026 \nAs noted initially, assets are stocks that can be combined and transformed to generate income \nand satisfy consumption and other essential needs and so if they become affected by climate \nshocks that could generate short term welfare fluctuations. More importantly if households \nhave few assets to protect vulnerable groups inside them during hardships this can transform \ninto more permanent disadvantages (i.e., restrict access to profitable opportunities in the  \n \n4\nfuture).\n3 The most common example found in the literature relates to rainfall shocks causally \nrelated to human capital formation: temporary poor health and child malnutrition that results \nfrom a drought could turn into stunting (height-for-age levels below some level observed in \nhealthy populations), lower school achievement, and attainment, as well as lower health and \nlower wages and productivity as an adult. \n \n  On health and education \nThe nutrition and food security literature have widely documented the effect that short-term \nblows to nutrition could have on health conditions through stunting, especially on the \nchildren. Tracing the impact of the 1982-84 droughts in Zimbabwe it was found that the \ntemporary hunger followed by stunting of those children aged between 12 and 24 months at \nthe time of the drought \u2013recognised as the most critical time for child growth- led to lower \nheight (2.3 centimetres) in late adolescence as well as delays in school enrolment (3.7 \nmonths) and reduction in grade completion (0.4 grades) 13 to 16 years after the droughts \n(Alderman, Hoddinott and Kinsey 2006). The educational setbacks are probably mediated by \nthe slow height growth in children (Glewwe, Jacoby and King 2000). Similarly, the 1994/95 \ndrought in that country lowered annual growth rates of children in the same age group by \nsomewhere between 1.5 and 2 cm., and four years after the failure of the rains in 1994/95, \nthese children remained shorter than identically aged children who had not experienced this \ndrought (Hoddinott and Kinley 2001). \nConsistent with the findings in Zimbabwe, drought shocks (expressed through crop \ndamage) in Ethiopia over the period 1995/96 had a large detrimental effect on child health. \nChildren aged six to twenty four months experienced about a 0.9 cm growth loss in height \nover a six-month period when half of their crop was damaged compared to communities \nwhose percentage of damaged crop area was 50% points lower. Put in a different way, a 10 \npercent point increase in the proportion of damaged plot areas corresponded to a reduction in \nchild growth by 0.12 cm over a six month period (Yamano et al. 2005). Similarly, Hurricane \nMitch in Nicaragua made the children in affected areas 30% less likely to be taken for \nmedical consultation conditional on being sick, even though there was no significant \ndifference on the prevalence of illness between affected and non-affected children. \nFurthermore, the probability of being undernourished among children in regions hit by Mitch \nalmost quadrupled (8.7 percentage points increase) and the overall distribution of their \nnutritional status \u2013especially of those in the tail\u2013 worsened significantly as a result of the \nstorm (Baez and Santos, 2007). \nThe damage to physical infrastructure and child labour are additional channels \nthrough which climate shocks can have an effect on children\u2019s educational attainment in the \nlong-run. An examination into the determinants of completed grades of schooling amongst \nadults born in four villages in eastern Guatemala found that the 1976 earthquake in that \ncountry had a statistically significant impact on the number of grades attained. By \nconstructing three measures of school quality (whether all six grades of primary schooling \nwere offered; the ratio of teachers to grades taught and the ability of a preschool) and \ncomparing them with whether schools closed after the 1976 earthquake and controlling for \nindividual\u2019s sex, cohort effects and locality fixed effects, two measures of school quality were \nfound to be affected by the covariate shock (Stein et al. 2003). The quality of school \nattainment could also be compromised by child labour. Three years after Hurricane Mitch hit \nNicaragua in 1998 no significant effect was found on school enrolment, however, labour force \nparticipation increased by 58% among children in areas affected by the hurricane. Similarly, \nthe proportion of children simultaneously enrolled in school and working more than doubled, \ngoing from 7.5% to 15.6% (Baez and Santos 2007).  \n Children are not the only group highly exposed to natural disasters. Studies of the \n1994\u201395 drought in Zimbabwe showed that women along with young children were the most \naffected while no impact on men\u2019s health was found. For women, though, the drought\u2019s effect \non health was temporary. With good rains the following year, they regained much of the lost \nbody mass. But sometimes the differentiated impact can be life-threatening. In a group of \n4,118 households in 16 states in India surveyed from 1969 to 1971 child mortality rates  \n \n5\nincreased during periods of very low rainfall and were significantly higher for girls than for \nboys (Rose 1999). In recent times, during the 2004 tsunami more women than men died. This \nwas highlighted early on when Oxfam announced that, in the villages it had surveyed, there \nwere three times as many adult male survivors as female ones, with some districts reaching \nfemale death percent rates of 77 and 80 (Oxfam 2005). Evidence that women\u2019s deaths \noutnumber men\u2019s also can be found after the 1991 Bangladesh cyclone, as well as the 1993 \nMaharashtra earthquake.  \nWomen and men have different vulnerabilities, and they cope with disasters \ndifferently. However, on balance, female-headed households fare worse than male-headed \nhouseholds following a natural disaster, in part because of their smaller average resource base \nand customary or formal laws that prevent their access to household possessions.  \n \n6\n \n \nVulnerable Groups during the Indian Ocean tsunami \nOn December 2004, a massive earthquake struck off the west coast of Northern Sumatra. This \nled to the most destructive series of tsunamis in recorded history, affecting up to 14 countries around \nthe Indian Ocean. Indonesia, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, India and Thailand were the hardest hit with \nentire coastal zones being destroyed, and the tsunamis causing damage up to 3km inland in some cases. \nThe magnitude of the tsunami disaster is dramatically captured by the death tolls: over \n227,000 people lost their lives and some 1.7 million were displaced. This raw death toll, however, \nmasks the disproportionate effect which the tsunamis had over some of the most vulnerable groups. In \nthe Maldives those aged 65 or over, though comprising only 3.1 per cent of the population, accounted \nfor 17.3 per cent of the deaths. Elsewhere the tsunami typically claimed more people under-15s and \nover-50s, with countries varying as to which of these two groups had the highest mortality rates.  \nSubstantial gender imbalances in terms of fatalities were also present. Several studies across \nIndonesia, Sri Lanka and India looking at the mortality risk for females compared to males found \nconsistently higher ratios for females varying from 1.2 (1.2 times as many women died) to 2.1, with \nwide variations for individual villages. Overall, the tsunami killed 40,000 to 45,000 more women than \nmen. \nSome of the reasons given for the gender and age differences in survival rates in these \ndisasters are usually related to strength and stamina, and the ability to swim or climb trees. For \ninstance, one study in Tamil Nadu found that women who were able to swim were more than twice as \nlikely to survive. However, it is clear that pre-existing vulnerabilities, whether socioeconomic, \nenvironmental, political, psychological, age- or gender-based, also contributed to the multiple \ndifferentiated impacts cited. In women, for instance, a number of factors contributed to their particular \nvulnerability before, during, and after the tsunamis: a lack of information about evacuation warnings \nand shelter options, culturally restricted mobility, and responsibilities within the family that make \nwomen stay behind to care for the young and the elderly. Moreover, governments not always \nrecognised or advanced their property rights during the post-tsunami implementation of housing, \nrelocation and livelihood strategies. During the response phase, female-dominated businesses, such as \nsmall-scale cottage industries and fish processing, were not always as visible as businesses run by men, \nand were less likely to be supported with livelihood recovery grants. There were also concerns about \nwomen being excluded from cash grant projects. In Sri Lanka, Oxfam found that women experienced \ndifficulties in accessing benefits, especially cash payments and rations, because families are usually \nregistered for government and insurance purposes under the man\u2019s name\u2019. Similarly, in the Maldives, \nwomen with small businesses often had no official registration and because they could not prove that \nthey had lost their livelihoods, they did not qualify for assistance. \nPolicy interventions should be tailored to the special needs of all these vulnerable groups to \nclimate shocks \u2014women, children, and the elderly\u2014; and particularly sensitive to possible forms of \ndiscrimination against them during recovery. Involving women in the management of shelters, \ntargeting female-headed households for support to lighten their workload, ensuring equity of treatment \non employment as well as gender neutrality in housing acquisition and access to land ownership, and \nestablishing workfare programs adapted to their needs, can all improve the recovery for women and \nhouseholds headed by women. Expanding early childhood development programs for newborn infants \nis also very important so as rebuilding schools \u2014to avoid loss of human capital for those already in \nschool-age and providing shelter for displaced people, including the elder.  \nA notable response along these lines during the tsunami came through the involvement of \nwomen groups in cash for work projects and helping them understand their right to equal pay for equal \nwork as unskilled labour performed by women usually earns less than for men. This was the focus of \nthe Indian NGO NESA\u2019s cash for work (CFW) program in India, which included seeding of \nplantations, pond and canal renovations, among other projects. While many men objected to this, the \nNGO insisted on it \u2013as indeed it would have contravened labour laws if the wages had been different- \nand women were able to participate and have a say on how cash was spent. NESA\u2019s CFW project also \nstrove to change attitudes and behaviour towards dalit households \u2013 at the bottom of the Hindu caste \nhierarchy- by involving them in the cash economy through CFW projects developing community assets \nwhich they had hitherto been excluded from. Participation in the CFW project in these areas in effect \nrenegotiated access by these groups to these resources, including women within them. \n \nSources: Adams and Nagarajan, 2006; World Bank, 2006; Telford et al., 2006; Oxfam, 2005; World Bank, 2000. \n  \n \n7\n \nThe shocks\u2019 persistence on the health, nutritional and educational status of children \ncould have further repercussions on their earning potential during adulthood. Looking at the \n1982/83/84 drought in Zimbabwe and using the values for the returns to education and \nage/job experience in the Zimbabwean manufacturing sector, it was found that 16 years later \nthose children affected by the drought had 7 percent loss of lifetime earnings (Alderman, \nHoddinott and Kinsey 2006). The mechanisms through which reduced height of a child could \nlead to lower productivity and lifetime earnings as an adult are the following: i) lower adult \nheight associated with reduced earnings as an adult (Thomas and Strauss, 1997); ii) poorer \ncognitive function as a child associated with poorer cognitive achievement as an adult which \ncould lead to lower adult earnings; iii) shorter stature as a child is associated with slower \nprogress through schooling which bring delays for enjoying its benefits once finished or \nsimply not finishing produces less grades completed and thus an impact on wages; and iv) \nstature by age three is strongly correlated with attained body size at adulthood which in case \nof deficit could lead to the early onset of chronic diseases and premature mortality among \nmale due to increased risk of cardiovascular and obstructive lung disease (Fogel, 1994), \nthough no evidence for developing countries exists on this yet. The early onset of chronic \ndiseases could turn into reduced life expectancy leading to shorter productivity or lifetime \nearnings (Alderman, Hoddinott and Kinsey 2006). \nRainfall shocks can also result in lower adult agricultural productivity and wages \nthrough their impact on adult\u2019s Body Mass Index (weight in kilograms\n divided by squared \nheight\n in meters) rather than children\u2019s height and intellectual development (Dercon and \nKrishnan, 2000). An investigation into the ability of household to smooth consumption in \nEthiopia show that rainfall shocks during 1994/95 significantly affected adult Body Mass \nIndex. Even though rainfall was relatively favourable in this period, relatively poor rainfall in \nsome communities lowered BMI by about 0.9 percent for households with low landholdings, \nsuggesting that the absence of effective risk management strategies was costly in terms of \nadult health.\n4 Moreover, the\n observed scale of adult\n malnutrition had functional consequences \nand\n affected labour productivity. In particular, clear\n correlations were found between \nmalnutrition and\n the ability to perform\n standard tasks, such as hoeing a field or carrying water \n(Dercon and Krishnan 2000).\n5 \nRainfall shocks could affect socioeconomic status at adulthood besides earnings and \nproductivity through a series of pathways that start at child health and end up in the choice of \na more educated partner. On examining the effect in 2000 of weather conditions around the \ntime of birth on the health, education, and socioeconomic outcomes of Indonesian adults born \nbetween 1953 and 1974,\n6 it was found that women with 20% higher rainfall in their year and \nlocation of birth attained 0.14 cm greater height, finished 0.15 more years of schooling, lived \nin households with 5.2% higher expenditures per capita, and have spouses with 5.1% higher \nearnings. The proposed causality to reach this outcomes was as follows: The positive impact \nof rainfall on agricultural output at the time of birth lead to higher household incomes and \nbetter health for infant girls. More importantly, suggestive evidence was presented that \neventual benefits for adult women\u2019s socioeconomic status are mediated by improved \nschooling attainment, which leads to higher spousal quality, which in turn improves \nsocioeconomic status (Maccini and Yang, 2006). \nThe relevance of shocks to child growth beyond their immediate health or nutritional \neffect or the long-term productivity effect could alert of a possible intergenerational \ntransmission of poorer health status resulting from a drought shock. A human development \ntrap could be backed by some epidemiological evidence that taller adult women experience \nfewer complications during child birth, have children with higher birth weights and \nexperience lower risks of child and maternal mortality (World Bank 1993).  \nThe policy implications are obvious: earlier interventions that shield children from \npotential damages of natural disasters on their human capital can reduce the likelihood of \nnegative repercussions in their productive life during adulthood as well as on the health of \ntheir offsprings. \n  \n \n8\nDroughts in Zimbabwe: repercussions and interventions to handle them \nIn rural Zimbabwe most households are regularly exposed to food shortage risk as a result of \ndrought, but at the same time Zimbabwe is one of the more developed countries in sub-Saharan Africa, \nwith markets more likely to function relatively well, making efficient responses to the risk of drought \npossible. It has been possible to test this and other hypotheses in a group of some 400 rural households \nfor over a decade (1983-96) in which the country has experienced four major droughts (1982-84, 1986-\n87, 1991-92 and 1994-95), including the most serious drought in the living memory of the country \n(1991-92). \nIn each drought private and public measures have been taken to thwart any possible negative \neffects. For instance, in the 1992 drought a series of government initiatives, including free food \ndistributions for the elderly and the disabled and food-for-work programs for destitute families with \nable-bodied members were put in place. Assistance with school and examination fees was provided as \nwell as child feeding supplementary programs. Households also implemented their own mechanisms to \ncope with food shortage, the most important of which had been cattle sales.  \nYet, there was little evidence that children from poor or nutritionally vulnerable households \ngot preferential access to the public feeding schemes. Moreover, the extent of action by the \nZimbabwean government had been impeded by the regularity of the previous successive droughts \nwhich brought about continuous risk-mitigation program demands. The core budget for the Department \nof Social Welfare, for example, declined in real terms by some 50% from the 1991-92 droughts to the \nnext one in 1994-95. \nOverall back in 1992 food consumption fell in spite of the variety of smoothing mechanisms \nemployed by households and government. Households cut sharply the quantity served at meals. At the \npeak of the drought almost a third of the panel households took only one meal per day and another 50% \nonly two meals. In addition, nearly 70% of households reduced the quantity served at meals, and about \na third of households consumed \u201cwild foods\u201d, such as edible plants, fruits and seeds, as well as animals \nand insects. \nSuch inability to smooth consumption is even more serious as the short-term blows to \nnutrition could translate into stunting, especially on the children. For instance, tracing the impact of the \n1982-84 droughts it was found that the temporary hunger followed by stunting of those children aged \nbetween 12 and 24 months at the time of the drought \u2013recognised as the most critical time for child \ngrowth- led to lower height (2.3 centimetres) in late adolescence as well as delays in school enrolment \n(3.7 months) and reduction in grade completion (0.4 grades) 13 to 16 years after the droughts. \nSimilarly, the 1994/95 drought lowered annual growth rates of children in the same age group by \nsomewhere between 1.5 and 2 cm., and four years after the failure of the rains in 1994/95, these \nchildren remained shorter than identically aged children who had not experienced the drought. \nFurthermore, the shocks\u2019 persistence on the health, nutritional and educational status of \nchildren had further repercussions on their earning potential during adulthood. Looking back at the \n1982-84 droughts and using the values for the returns to education and age/job experience in the \nZimbabwean manufacturing sector, it was found that 16 years later those children affected by the \ndrought had 7 percent loss of lifetime earnings.  \nAll this damage which compromised the human development of children and jeopardized \nlong-run potential gains achieved through their human capital underscores the relevance of adopting \neffective measures against recurrent droughts. In particular, a gradual shift from the emergency relief \nmeasures described, including cyclical public safety net responses, towards ex ante actions that could \nenhance wellbeing and reduce poverty making households more resilient to hardships seems desirable.  \nAn empirical study tracking the same group of rural Zimbabwean households this time over \nfive years (1992-1996) with the 1994-5 drought episode in the midst compared the income effect of the \nobserved ex post public responses to drought (grain loans) against the effect of a counterfactual ex ante \nintervention two years prior to the shock (provision of capital and extension services). After developing \nan empirical model in which capital and extension services increase net crop incomes that in turn \nincrease holdings of agricultural tools and livestock without crowding out private transfers, the value of \nthe assistance transferred to households in the form of grain loans was reallocated into households in \nthe form of capital and extension services to run a series of counterfactuals. Doing so reduced poverty \nin non-drought years and at the same time allowed households to build up enough buffer stock to \nprotect against the potential droughts. Incidentally, additional livestock only reduced marginally the \nimpact of the drought in income terms, but it might have assisted positively children anthropometric \nmeasures as another study looking at children aged 12-24 months residing in households below and \nabove the median value of pre-drought livestock holdings during the 1994/95 drought found that the \nshock only affected the growth height of children residing in households with little livestock. \nSources: Alderman et al. 2006; Owens et al. 2003; Munro 2002; Hoddinott and Kinsey 2001; Kinsey et al. 1998.  \n \n9\nOn livestock \nIn accordance with the theory of optimal savings, more liquid assets and savings in the form \nof livestock or other non-fungible items might imply less vulnerability for those households \nwhich face substantial climate risks but cannot smooth consumption through insurance or \ncredit (Fafchamps et al. 1998). In many rural areas, including sub-Saharan Africa, livestock \nherds are the main way to compensate the failure of access to credit and insurance markets. \nHowever, during droughts many factors affect the capacity of the household to turn this \nproductive asset into a better command over food \u2013 the trades of terms with other goods of \nconsumption deteriorate, high covariance with other sources of income and death \nsusceptibility. In the Ethiopian drought of the late nineties, livestock herds began to decline as \nearly as late 1997 due to death, but a larger number were also sold at \u2018throwaway\u2019 prices of \n30 per cent or less of normal rates. Group interviews at the time (1999) showed that livestock \nsales were the main drought coping mechanism for 90 per cent of male and 71 per cent of \nfemale herd owners. Sales and physical extinction brought aggregate declines in oxen and \ntotal herds of almost 40 per cent from 1998 to mid-2000. \nMoreover, when households start with very low levels of livestock the effects of \ndrought on livestock can go beyond the inability to meet short-term needs. In the same study \nof Ethiopia, those families with few livestock had limited breeding in their herds. In contrast \nto better off households who usually manage to get back to their asset lots, they were forced \nto borrow or purchase animals during the post-drought period when livestock prices were \nespecially high, and were also constrained in pursuing cultivation just as conditions were \nimproving. This difficulty for re-stocking herds contributed to the fact that 95 per cent of \nthose households with one or fewer TLU remained poor or vulnerable after six years in the \nstudy (Little, et al., 2006). Another study of famine effects in the Horn of Africa during the \nmid 1980s confirmed the harshness for households to improve or recover their status: 10 \nyears after the famine, cattle holdings in Ethiopian households were still only two-thirds what \nthey were just before the famine (Dercon 2002). \nSometimes households intentionally destabilize consumption to conserve livestock \nduring a drought (Udry 2006). The deliberate postponement of short-term consumption to \npreserve the future sustainability of the livelihood by conserving productive asset is not \nuncommon either, but the implications of going hungry are then unknown. Ideally, access to \ncredit services in a post-disaster situation will enhance the coping capacity of the poor not \nonly by helping them to smooth consumption, but also by preventing them from the need to \nmake distress sales of assets such as land or livestock at bargain prices while allowing faster \nreplacement of lost assets. \n \nOn land and housing \nAlthough access to land and housing varies widely from one context to another and is often \nillegal and insecure, where available it represents more than shelter to ensure physical \nwellbeing. In the urban context, housing makes up for failures observed across formal labour \nmarkets. It can become an important productive asset to generate income through rental \nopportunities and the use of its space for home-based production activities as well as \ncollateral to access credit and other formal risk management mechanisms to fulfil emergency \nloans for consumption purposes or shield other productive assets during shocks.  \nHowever, a set of elements usually conspire against housing and land rendering them \nhighly ineffective to smooth any impact. Land pressures force people to move into areas at \nrisk of floods or landslides. This limited access to appropriate housing markets translate into \nlack of land rights, for example shantytowns, which means there is little incentive to make \nadaptations to dwellings so that they are more able to withstand damage. It also means that \nauthorities can refuse services and infrastructure to illegal settlements. Hence, the resulting \nbad quality of housing, infrastructure and services exacerbates the degree of exposure against \nclimate hazards. \nIf the usual replacements against credit market failures, such as land and livestock in \nrural areas and housing material and personal belongings in urban areas are affected by \nnatural calamities the prospects of recovery become distant.  In post-Mitch Honduras, when  \n \n10\nhousehold experienced housing loss, the recovery of productive assets was significantly \nslowed by approximately 10%. When people\u2019s homes were destroyed, they lose a valuable \nasset and even their means to make a living as they lose tools and materials.\n7 \nAn in-depth qualitative study of poverty and vulnerability carried out in 10 \nGuatemalan villages in 2000 also revealed how natural disasters can have long-lasting \nnegative effects on the welfare of families through the destruction of physical key assets. \nSome 25 years after the earthquake of 1976 in that country many respondents reported still \nliving in homes that were badly damaged by it. Similarly, the experience of one ladino village \nlocated in the Nororiente Region of the country reflected how Hurricane Mitch completely \nwiped out the main productive base of some villages. Prior to the hurricane, the main source \nof income for the village was agriculture, with a diverse range of production: lemons, papaya, \ntobacco, melons, eggplant, palms for raw material from artisan work, corn for subsistence, \nand livestock. In the aftermath of Mitch, however, land was severely damaged, rendering it \nlargely infertile because the flooding basically washed away the productive topsoil and \ndumped rocks all over the fields. Livestock animals and farm implements were also destroyed \nforcing most individuals to travel elsewhere to look for jobs, with some 400 (half of the \nvillage population) migrating to the capital or to the US and leaving their families behind \n(Tesliuc and Lindert 2002). \nIn cases where housing and land are being permanently affected by climate hazards it \nbecomes almost impossible for households to improve their lives and reduce their long-term \nvulnerability. In Bangladesh, the population living in the char lands\n8 which form and re-form \non an annual or longer basis with changes in courses along all of the major rivers due to \nfloods becomes periodically landless and homeless. It is estimated that 4.3 million inhabitants \nof the char lands in the major river system comprise the most vulnerable group in this \ncountry. The recurrent destruction of agricultural land and village settlements limits their \nopportunities to relieve debt and attain savings. Moreover, displacees are not only removed \nfrom their socio-economic structures, but usually enter the urban workforce with marked \ndisadvantages because of their lower levels of education and lack of marketable working \nskills (Hutton and Haque 2004). \n \n\u2026And very possibly in social capital \nThe lack of access to formal credit and insurance markets is also compensated informally \nthrough mutual support networks. However, it is increasingly acknowledged that family and \ncommunity support mechanisms come under stress during natural disasters, including \ndrought-induced famines (Rahmato 1988; de Waal 1989). In principle, the mobilization of \nsupport inside communities during common shocks should be harder because everyone is \naffected and thus risk cannot be shared (Skoufias 2003). Even more fundamentally, the \npersistence of poverty heightened by continuous climate shocks leaves little time for \nassociation and social action with others as the families have to use most of their time to \nensure  their basic needs. Women\u2019s community activities and links between nuclear and \nextended families may be reduced due to the need for women to leave their home and search \nextra work as well as children for participating in productive activities. All this could lead to \nweakened relationships with the extended family and ineffective reciprocal exchange with \nneighbours and even anger and resentment. \nA study comprising 500 households living in prefabricated houses in three provinces \nof Turkey after the 1999 East Marmara earthquake found that this shock torn apart the fabric \nof society. The survivors lost their houses, shops and durable goods and their rent. They were \nforced to liquidate their savings and faced strong pressures of indebtedness. This reinforced \nthe difficulties for dealing with the hardship even in the presence of social networks because \nhouseholds had in general less financial means and hence more constrained to give away. In \nconsequence, a second factor identified as social solidarity, which included items of solidarity \namong friends, neighbours, relatives, countrymen and within the family before and after the \nearthquake was also adversely affected. Inter familial ties and support relations with relatives, \nneighbours and fellow immigrants after the earthquake were strained and almost broken as \npeople were hardly able to think and care about others (Kasapoglu and Ecevit 2003).  \n \n11\nAnother channel that needs to be explored is the impact of migrations and \ndisplacement provoked by climate shocks as possible sources of distress. The cohesion of \nhouseholds and communities certainly erodes when men and women are forced to migrate to \nfind employment. Family members left behind for long stretches have less time and fewer \nresources to contribute to and sustain community relations. In addition, migration can reduce \nsocial cohesion in the host community.  \nThere is no conclusive evidence in this respect. The existing literature seems to \nacknowledge that migration is one of the primary responses to a natural disaster. Yet, a couple \nof empirical studies reviewed go against the tide by showing either non-occurrence of out-\nmigration in the aftermath of a tornado in Bangladesh in 2004 (Paul 2005) or at least the \nmaintenance of rural reciprocity networks despite flood-induced migration (Hutton and \nHaque 2004).   \n \nShort and long-term impacts on assets are borne disproportionately by the poor \nShort and long-term climate shock impacts are more likely to be observed across poor \nhouseholds as these can only afford to live in marginal areas and have a limited ability to \nmanage risks due to their low asset holdings and manifest constraints to access credit and \ninsurance markets. In rural areas, for instance, land pressures lead small farmers to retreat \nfurther into steep mountain regions. This could have fatal consequences. In the 1977 floods in \nAndhra Pradesh, India, the 23-27% death rate for small farmers and fisherman, contrasted \nwith the 3% death rate for large farmers and local level officials. The later non-poor group \nwas less vulnerable to the cyclone because of their ability to speedily evacuate by road, the \ntype and strength of their houses, and the small variations in topography in their residential \nlocations (Winchester 1986). \nPhysical asset recovery from natural disasters can also be wealth-differentiated \naffecting those with less means. Looking at the effects of Mitch on productive assets in \nHonduras, across all pre-Mitch wealth quartiles households without asset losses showed \nsubstantially higher growth than those that suffered losses 30 months later. However, as of \n2001, the gap was 13.8% for the lowest quartile where poor households had showed -5% net \ngrowth (loss) over the post-Mitch period, while poor households without losses had 8.8% \ngrowth, whereas the gap was a smaller 5.1% for the wealthiest quartile (-2.1% versus 3% \npost-Mitch growth) (Carter et al. 2006). \nMore generally, a study on poverty and vulnerability in Guatemala in 2000 showed \nhow the probability of experiencing a material loss following bad harvests and droughts, \ndrops significantly as household wealth rises, after controlling for other potential \ndeterminants (Tesliuc and Lindert 2002). This regularity seems to endure for other regional \ncontexts as well. Richest households in both Burkina Faso and Ethiopia had much higher crop \nyields than the poorest during the severe drought years of 1984/5. For instance, cow milk \nyields in Ethiopia for the richest group were unchanged by the drought at five litres per day \nthrough the use of purchased feed, but for the poor group, milk yields fell from five to one \nlitres per day. In the same group of studies, the richest in Sahelian Burkina Faso and Upland \nEthiopia appeared better protected from crop price variations than the poorest (Webb and \nReardon 1992). \nThe material incapacity of poor households to protect from natural disasters can end \nin the forced extinction of their few remaining assets or the adoption of strategies which could \nbring about a serious backlash in human development deepening their poverty or even worst \nprolonging their poverty into future generations. \n \n  This could lead to the depletion of an already diminished asset base \nEven if the odds for loosing assets are not tilted against the poorest households, any impact in \ntheir wealth is likely to have more resounding effects. A survey of rural poor households in \nHonduras shown that by 1999 Hurricane Mitch had destroyed household implements, tools, \nor animals of over one quarter in the highest quintile of wealth compared to just 10 percent of \nthe poorest households. But because the poorest had so few assets to start with, the impact of \nthe Hurricane losses was much more significant to them: affected households in the lowest  \n \n12\nquintile of wealth lost nearly 18% of their pre-Mitch asset value and 40% of their total crop \nvalue, compared to just 3% and 25% respectively for the affected households in the highest \nquintile of pre-Mitch wealth and crop value (Morris et al., 2002). The same conclusion was \nreached by a different study on the impact of Mitch on rural Honduran households: despite \nthe percentage of households suffering a loss of productive assets (primarily plantations and \nland) increased with household wealth rising from 22% to 68% from the first to the fourth \nwealth quartile, among those households suffering asset losses, poorer households lost a \ngreater percentage of their productive wealth (31%) than did wealthier households (8%) \n(Carter et al, 2006).  \n \n \u2026 or to the adoption of strategies that can erode the asset base \nWhile coping strategies might be useful in the short-term or indeed those who employ them \nface little option, they might hurt long-term development. Some people have proposed three \nstages of coping starting with the adoption of insurance and non-erosive mechanisms; then the \ndisposal of productive assets or erosive coping; and ending in destitution or non-coping (De \nWaal 1989; Davies 1996).  Migration is often placed in this last stage perceived as a failure to \ncope. \nWithdrawing children from school to cope with shocks in the presence of credit and \ninsurance market failures is also considered an erosive strategy as it is possible that lost \nschooling leads to lifelong losses in the earning ability of children. Poor rural farmers in the \nSemi-Arid Tropic (SAT) region of India rely on child labour, and thereby school attendance, \nas a central self-insurance strategy against income fluctuations arising from rainfall shocks. In \nparticular, small farm households are inadequately insured ex ante and therefore have a \ngreater probability of taking children out of school after unanticipated weather shocks (Jacoby \nand Skoufias 1995). A similar case of droughts affecting human capital accumulation in the \npresence of credit constraints was observed in the 1962-63 drought in Rajasthan. At that time, \nsmall farm households relied heavily on wages from public relief works to supplement or as \nsole income whereas large farmers sold their assets. The resulting situation was one of higher \nfood prices, falling asset prices (except goats) and a deleterious impact on human capital \nformation as 42 children no longer attended school (Jodha 1975). More recently, evidence \nfrom poor rural households in Mexico observed over the period 1998-2000, shows an increase \nin child labour as a response to droughts and other climatic hazards in their communities, \nconfirming that children are indeed used as risk-coping instruments to respond to natural \ndisasters. This is particularly notorious for the 15\u201318 age group, which is highly vested in the \nlabor market with a participation rate of 38.8% (de Janvry et al. 2006). \nComparable responses have been identified in rural areas of Africa. Exploiting inter-\nregional weather variation between 1985 and 1988 and cross-sectional data from Cote \nd\u2019Ivoire it was found that enrolment rates declined by about 20 percentage points for boys and \ngirls in shock regions -were rainfall data was more than one absolute standard deviation from \nthe historical mean- relative to children in the non-shock regions (Jensen 2000). \n  The adoption of erosive coping responses that may destroy or reduce the asset stock of \nfamilies in response to the absence of other key assets goes beyond education. It can also \nhappen with physical, financial, or social capital leading to more permanent effects. In the \nSAT region of India it has been shown how the presence of low incomes combined with \nborrowing constraints and no weather-insurance has led to underinvestment in bullocks which \nare a central production factor for impoverished rural farmers. Bullocks are one of the \nfavourite mechanisms used to cope with shocks in rural South India, but this comes at the \nexpense of agricultural profitability by not permitting farmers to accumulate larger capital \ngoods (Rosenzweig and Wolpin 1993). \n \nClimate shocks covariance exacerbates the fragility of poor people\u2019s assets  \nAccording to the food security literature, the most heavily used mechanism to compensate for \nshortfalls in income is borrowing for consumption in the informal credit market. The practice \nof going into debt seems to be common among both the urban and rural poor who most \nprobably turn to friends and relatives, and from moneylenders who probably charge high  \n \n13\ninterest rates, especially if we consider that access to formal credit markets is uncommon in \nrural areas. However, borrowing to maintain consumption is ineffective when the risk is \ncovariate, as many people borrow at the same time pushing up interest rates and rationing \ncredit. Even in the presence of informal group-based borrowing institutions interest rates are \nlikely to go up as the village credit market is necessarily personal and spatially restricted so \nthat severe droughts over consecutive years eventually lead to rising interest rates. Hence, \nborrowing money in the presence of a covariate and prolonged climate shock, especially \ndroughts, is likely to send household into a cycle of spiralling debt transforming the resources \ninto a financial liability as interest rates go up and the consumption needs remain present. \nIn the 1962-63 droughts in Rajasthan, India, borrowing from friends and neighbours \nwas the major household coping strategy in the initial three months after the flood. But the \nreliance of poor and flood-exposed households on private sector borrowing had adverse \nimplications for their food security and economic growth in the medium term. Fifteen months \nafter the flood, 64.2% of flood-exposed households in the bottom 40% of the expenditure \ndistribution who were in debt averaged 146% of one month\u2019s average consumption; and for \nthe poorest 40% of households flood -and non-flood-exposed, total debts averaged 150% of \nmonthly expenditures (Jodha 1975). \nLikewise, the fairly localized but prolonged three-year drought in the mid-1980s in \nthe Telangana region within India\u2019s Semi-Arid Tropics Region, where Mahbubnagar villages \nare located, precipitated a sharp rise in borrowing in the informal market in Dokur where the \nlarge village tank did not fill for rainy season paddy cultivation from 1985/86 to 1987/88. \nDuring the first drought year the village credit market was found relatively capable of \nfinancing a surprising amount of consumption credit without appreciable changes in interest, \nbut appreciable changes in interest rates were recorded well into the second drought year \n(Bidinger et al. 1991). \nIn the 1998 floods in Bangladesh, more than 60% of poor, flood-exposed families in a \nsample of 750 households borrowed money in the months immediately following the flood, \nand of these more than half borrowed money for food. Household debts rose to an average of \n1.5 months of typical consumption compared with only a small percentage of monthly \nconsumption in January 1998, about eight months before the floods. The percentage of \nhouseholds with outstanding debt one year after the flood decreased progressively from \nNovember 1998, when it was at the highest with 66% of the households, to 54% in \nNovember, 1999. Nevertheless, the average amount owed still constituted a large share of the \ntotal expenditure leaving households vulnerable to another shock (del Ninno et al. 2001). \nAnother reason for asking for loans even if moneylenders charge exorbitant interest \nrates could be that poor people refuse to liquidate valuable assets (Fachamps et al. 1998). This \nlast-resort action usually takes place to protect consumption. Unfortunately, the aggregate \nnature of climate shocks might condition the usefulness of assets as precautionary savings \nbecause the oversupply (sale) of assets during times of distress may depress their value as \neveryone tries to sell them at the same time. In addition, the ease with which they can be \nmobilized becomes really circumscribed in the presence of aggregate shocks affecting more \ntheir value. \nMany regions have witnessed the process of collapse in asset prices when everyone \ntries to sell them at the same time leading to very low returns. The detailed study of the \n1962/63 drought in several villages in Rajasthan India remains the classical example of \nfarmers\u2019 response to (except for the prominence of livestock) and the consequences of severe \ndrought in India\u2019s SemiArid Tropics (Jodha 1975). At that time, traditional risk management \nmethods did little to protect crop and livestock income, which contributed negligibly to \nhousehold sustenance income during the drought year. With scarcity the price of pearl millet, \nthe staple food, increased by about 60 percent; and milk prices rose by 280 percent. Most \nhouseholds particularly small farm households, relied heavily on wages from public relief \nworks while large farm households compensated for the shortfall in agricultural income by \nselling assets, which led to gyrating prices. The price of bullocks declined by 51 percent, dry \ncows by 80 percent, lactating cows by 48 percent, sheep by 60 percent, and bullock carts by \n40 percent.  The only exception was the price of goats, which are more divisible and better  \n \n14\nacclimate to drought than most other domestic livestock species, that actually went up by \nabout 24 percent (Jodha 1975). Ultimately, compared to the year before the drought, food \ngrain consumption per day per adult fell by about 14 percent showing how droughts can affect \nhealth and nutritional outcomes. \nSimilarly, the 1999 drought in Ethiopia was also a year of heaviest livestock asset \nreductions, both due to animal deaths as well as sales. Based on interviews in the course of \nqualitative surveys in the study area, it was estimated that 25 percent of livestock reductions \nin 1999 were distress sales at which the seller received less than 50 percent of the normal \nprice of the animal sold. Cattle prices, for example, dropped from an average of 625 birr in \nthe pre-drought period to 291 birr. Price swings of this magnitude constituted a huge capital \nloss for those forced to sell livestock during this period (Carter et al., 2006). \nThe problem of covariation between local shocks and local asset prices has led some \nstudies to conclude that livestock does not always serve empirically as a buffer to the extent \nsuggested (Fafchamps et al. 1998). However, the interplay between shocks and responses \nsuch as drawing down assets is inconclusive. Other studies point out at small stock as an \nimportant mechanism that households can rely on when dealing with risk (Rosenzweig and \nWolpin 1993) and thus avoid further impacts on human development. During the 1994/95 \ndrought in Zimbabwe, livestock did appear to buffer the drought impact over children living \nin poor households: a regression of growth in the height of children 12-24 months for children \nresiding in households below and above the median value of pre-drought livestock holdings \nfound that drought only affected the growth of children residing in poorer households \n(Hoddinott and Kinsey 2001). \n \n  \u2026 And so does their frequency \nThe frequency and intensity of major disasters is also of great relevance to the recovery of \npoorer households. It has been suggested that in the presence of consecutive negative shocks \nthe use of asset savings for consumption smoothing is not compatible with accumulation \n(Deaton, 1992; Dercon, 2002). If bad harvests resulting from climate shocks persist over \nseveral years in a row households would have to have large stores of assets to smooth \nconsumption; otherwise this outcome would be unaccomplished and buffer stocks themselves \ncould become depleted. A time series of 100-period horizon simulations over income, \nconsumption and assets randomly generated shown that consumption is much smoother than \nincome due to the existence of assets that buffer the effects of poor harvests.\n9 However, if \nconsumption gets protected by assets initially after a shock, in a second consecutive bad \nharvest with no time to build up assets, consumers are left exposed to a succession of poor \nharvest (Deaton, 1992). This makes drought and flood especially bad within the different \ntypes of natural disasters (Morduch 1999). \nOn a more practical basis, a study of drought impact on poverty dynamics in north-\neastern Ethiopia from 1997-2003 with a major drought in-between (1999-2000) found that the \nability of the poor and very poor in this area to move beyond a certain threshold of asset \nviability before the next drought strikes is limited, and this has been the case for many \nhouseholds since at least the 1984 famine in Ethiopia. According to this study, under a very \noptimistic post-drought annual growth rate of about 0.3 TLU per year, it would still take very \npoor households about eight to ten years to reach an asset threshold of around 1.0 TLU per \ncapita (an average of 4.5 TLU per household or two oxen, one cow and 15 small stocks would \nbe the equivalent of a non-poor household in the area). But because in the past 20 years there \nwere major droughts in 1983\u201384, 1991\u201392, 1999\u20132000, and, again, in 2002, and minor ones \nin almost one out of three years, the poor face a situation where once they begin to re-build \ntheir assets, the next drought wipes out the gains and recovery ensues again. The main \ndifference between the poor and non-poor is not that the former have higher post-drought \nrecovery rates, but that they rarely reach a level where they can sustain themselves out of \npoverty before the next drought strikes (Little et al. 2006). \nIn a study of drought impact in Zimbabwe over 1983-96 in which the country \nexperienced four major droughts (in 1982-84, 1986-87, 1991-92 and 1994-95) the problem of \nzero stocks as a result of a series of negative shocks was not relevant for the population as a  \n \n15\nwhole. In fact, wealth in the form of cattle had grown enormously in the panel of households \nstudies, in spite of the repeated occurrence of drought. However, if the panel was \ndisaggregated the reduction of herd size for particular groups of the population was quite \ndramatic. For instance, in the 1992-93 drought more than 20% of households experienced \nnegative changes in herd size in relation to the opening stocks of cattle; Secondly, the extent \nof action by the Zimbabwean government was impeded by the adverse consequences of \nsuccessive droughts. For instance, in the face of continuous risk-mitigation program demands, \nthe core budget for the Department of Social Welfare declined in real terms by some 50% \nfrom one drought to another (1990-91/1994-95). \n  In a similar fashion, there is a general consensus that the 1998 Bangladesh floods had \na lower impact on the affected population than the 1988 floods, even though the 1998 floods \nwere of a considerably longer duration in most places. One of the reasons for this was that \nprevious to 1988 there had been two major floods, in 1987 and 1984, which undoubtedly left \nmany poorer households in a precarious situation and unable to recover their pre-disaster \nsituation before the next disaster occurred (Beck 2005). \nIn sum, the impact of climate risks on assets goes beyond their physical extinction. If \nbad harvests resulting from climate shocks persist over several years in a row households \ncould find relatively large stores of assets insufficient to smooth consumption. There are other \nasset attributes that could also be affected by the occurrence of climate risks due to their \naggregate nature. For instance, the fact that assets can hold their value or, in other words, \nmaintain a reasonable return and limited risk during times of stress is an important dimension \nthat needs to be considered when assessing the specific impact of natural disasters on assets. \nIn addition, shocks can affect the returns-generating potential (i.e., sustainability) of an asset \nvia the nutrition-adult height-adult productivity conduit early illustrated. \n \nRESILIENCE \n  Some recovery from natural disasters is still possible\u2026 \nThere is some evidence of catching-up from the effects of weather-induced shocks on \nnutrition, that is, over time children may recover lost nutrition and return to their personal \ngrowth curve. Full catching up from lost height growth was found in samples from rural India \nand Philippines after controlling for the endogeneity of past anthropometric levels (Behrman, \nDeolalikar and Lavy 1995). However, their results might not be completely valid as they \nconflate children above 3 with children below 3 for whom catch-up growth might not be \nexpected (Hoddinott and Kinsey 2001).  \nOther studies focusing on weight, rather than height, have produced evidence of \ncatching up controlling for all sorts of different effects. In a study of weight gain among \nchildren in Bangladesh over a three-month period following the 1988 floods, children of less \nweight in the immediate post-flood period tend to grow more over the subsequent period.  \nHowever, there was faster growth among children in better-off households or those who had \nbetter access to credit markets whereas those children in the landless households were \nespecially vulnerable to the conditions created by the flood due to credit constraints (Foster, \n1995). Moreover, as opposed to the considerable evidence linking child height with \nsubsequent adult health and other outcomes, there is very limited literature linking lower child \nweight to adult weight, productivity and lifetime earnings. Hence, ultimately, the economic \nimportance of these findings remains unclear (Hoddinott and Kinsey 2001). This may be \nbecause weight fluctuates much more than height in the short-run, and because very short-run \nchanges in weight are not necessarily manifest in long-term height growth. But even if some \ncatching up results this would not avoid the substantial transitory costs to the child\u2019s health \n(Dercon 2005). \n \nBut this is largely driven by the existence of adequate coping mechanisms \nThe lack of adequate assets to deal with a shock could largely compromise the growth \nprospects of the household members. In the absence of buffer stocks the household might not \nbe able to protect its most vulnerable members or might adopt costly coping strategies for \nboth short -and long term well-being. For instance, the 1998 flood in Bangladesh caused  \n \n16\nmany preschool children to lose weight and/or to fail to grow at a critical period in their \nmental and physical development.\n10 This situation was brought about by a combination of \nfactors, including reduced access to food, the increased difficulties of providing proper care \nfor children that came with disruptions in home life and the greater exposure of children to \ncontaminants. However, 15 months after the flood, most children appeared to regain the same \nnutritional status they had a few months after the flood (in November 1998). Unfortunately, \nwithin the flood-exposed households, the percentage of stunted children for those in the \nbottom 40 percentile remained much higher than that of households in the top 20 percentile a \nyear after the flood making more likely a long lasting impact on the nutritional status of these \npoor children (del Ninno and Lundberg 2005). \n \n   Coping mechanisms in turn seem to be strongly determined by wealth \nRecovery is also possible on productive assets affected by natural disasters. However, as \nsuggested by the cases of weight recovery and nutritional status of Bangladeshi children, this \nrecovery might be wealth-differentiated militating against any tendency of the poor to catch \nup with wealthier households. Moreover, as noted earlier, those households with limited \nresources for dealing with hardships could end up adopting coping strategies which erode the \nsubsistence base of the household thereby compromising its future recovery or the prospects \nof some of its members. For instance, rather than keeping livestock for productive purposes \nhouseholds could be forced to sell them out to meet short-term needs; or instead of keeping \nchildren in school to enhance their human capital parents pull them out to involve them in \nremunerative activities. A couple of studies on asset dynamics and recovery experiences in \nthe wake of environmental shocks in Ethiopia (three-year drought during the late 1990s) and \nHonduras (Hurricane Mitch in 1998) reveal that the poorest households appear to be forced \ninto long-term poverty traps as they have to dispose of valuable assets which are then needed \nfor recovery and in consequence struggle several years after the shocks to recover their pre-\nshock asset levels if ever.  \nLooking at pre-drought and recovery livestock growth trajectories for a sample of \nrural Ethiopian households tracked over a seven-year period from 1996 to 2003  \nit was found that the better endowed decumulate assets faster in the course of experiencing a \nseries of droughts, and also that this group was relatively better equipped to rebuild assets in \nthe wake of these shocks. The growth rate of livestock was found to be increasing in herd size \nup to a level of 25 tropical livestock units (TLUs)\n11 indicating that households that exited the \ndrought with few livestock were strongly disadvantaged in their rate of recovery period \ngrowth. Moreover, community membership in social organizations (social capital) increased \nthe rate of growth (or limited the rate of loss) of livestock over the six years, but again \nprimarily for households in the higher wealth groups (Carter et al. 2006). \nLikewise, a study over a sample of rural Honduran households on the impact of \nHurricane Mitch in 1998 on the value of land, plantations, machinery and livestock right after \nthe shock as well as their evolution up to 2001, two and half years after Mitch, also proved \nthat post-shock resilience displays a strongly wealth-differentiated pattern, especially in the \nabsence of labour and capital markets.\n12 With absent good market access, a low wealth \nhousehold that experienced an immediate 31% asset loss went through further declines and a \nnet asset growth rate of -48% from its pre-Mitch position to the time of the study 30 months \nlater. In contrast, a wealthier household that experienced an identical 31% loss recovered \npartially from the loss and exhibit a net growth rate of -14%. But given that wealthier \nhouseholds on average only lost 7.5% of their assets (not 31%), then the unequalising effect \nof the shock was further magnified. Interestingly, under labour and capital market access, \nlower wealth households would be able to offset much of the 31% asset loss (climbing back \nto a net asset change of -10%) while wealthier households would also benefit slightly from \nbetter market access, giving place to almost a complete elimination of the final recovery gap \nbetween poor and rich households (Carter et al. 2006).  \n \n \n  \n \n17\nHurricane Mitch: wealth differentiated damage and recovery \nHurricane Mitch hit Honduras \u2013as well as other areas of Central America- from 25 October to \n1 November 1998. As it moved inland and remained static over the isthmus for days, it resulted in the \nlargest natural disaster experienced in the recent memory of the country. \nHonduras is well-known for its vulnerability to natural disasters, including seismic and \nvolcanic activity, hurricanes and tropical storms. However, man-made factors compound this \nvulnerability. Environmental degradation, in particular the loss of hillside pine forests mainly due to \nextensive logging and slash and burn agricultural practices created the conditions for massive flooding \nand landslides during the Hurricane. In addition, massive disparities in the distribution of wealth had \nhistorically pushed wider segments of the population into marginal areas with a limited ability to \nmanage this type of shocks due to low asset holdings and manifest constraints to access credit and \ninsurance markets. \nThe disaster affected over 1.5 million people, the highest on record for any disaster in \nHonduras, including: 5,757 dead, 12,272 injured and 8,058 reported missing; 441,150 people \ndisplaced; and over 4.2 million people without access to running water or the equivalent to 70% of the \nentire population. Health problems skyrocketed including gastro-intestinal infections, acute respiratory \ninfections, dehydration, and injuries caused by the floods. Even leptospirosis, which had been virtually \nnon-existent in the previous year, reappeared. \nBeyond the immediate death toll, Mitch severely damaged or destroyed key productive assets, \nseriously disrupting the livelihoods of many households permanently. Agricultural output dropped \ndramatically, as livestock animals were lost or drowned, and land became largely infertile or eroded, \nbecause the flooding basically washed away the productive topsoil and dumped rocks all over the fields \nor covered them in mud. Roads, hospitals, and even prisons, were damaged or destroyed on a massive \nscale as well. The loss to the economy has been estimated at some US$4 billion. \nWith over half of its total population living in poverty and about the same share of the total \npopulation (49%) living in rural areas, it was the rural poor who bear the brunt of the impact, even \nthough many of them were not living in the northern coast and the southern watersheds -the most \naffected areas by the Hurricane. According to poverty estimates before and after Mitch the share of \nrural households living in poverty following Mitch increased about five percentage points, from 69.2 % \nto 74.6%. \nAnd more precisely it was on the poorest of the rural poor where the Hurricane had the more \nresounding effects. A survey of rural poor households in Honduras shown that by 1999 Mitch had \ndestroyed the household implements, farming tools, or animals of over one quarter in the highest \nquintile of wealth compared to just 10 percent of the poorest households. But because the poorest had \nso few assets to start with, the affected households in the lowest quintile of wealth lost nearly 18% of \ntheir pre-Mitch asset value and 40% of their total crop value, compared to just 3% and 25% \nrespectively for the affected households in the highest quintile of pre-Mitch wealth and crop value. \nRecovery on productive assets for the poorest households would have been easier in the \npresence of labour and capital markets, but in their absence this recovery became wealth-differentiated \nmilitating against any tendency of the poor to catch up with wealthier households. More importantly, a \nstudy on asset dynamics and recovery experiences in the wake of Mitch revealed that the poorest \nappear to be forced into long-term poverty traps as they have to dispose of valuable assets, which were \nthen needed for recovery and in consequence struggle several years after the shocks to recover their \npre-shock asset levels if ever.  \nTracking the value of land, plantations, machinery and livestock of rural Honduran right after \nthe shock as well as their evolution up to 2001, two and half years after Mitch, proved that with absent \noff-farm labour market earnings and access to credit,\n a low wealth household that experienced an \nimmediate 31% asset loss went through further declines and a net asset growth rate of -48% from its \npre-Mitch position to 30 months later. In contrast, a wealthier household that experienced an identical \n31% loss recovered partially from the loss and exhibit a net growth rate of -14%. But given that \nwealthier households on average only lost 7.5% of their assets (not 31%), then the unequalising effect \nof the shock was further magnified. Under labour and capital market access, lower wealth households \nwould have been able to offset much of the 31% asset loss (climbing back to a net asset change of -\n10%) while wealthier households would also benefit slightly from better market access, giving place to \nalmost a complete elimination of the final recovery gap between poor and rich households. \n \nSources: Carter et al. 2006; Telford et al. 2004; Morris et al. 2001. \n \n \n  \n \n18\nThe organisation of livelihoods before shocks materialise can impact on asset returns \nHousehold\u2019s assets can also be affected by uninsured climate risks before they actually take \nplace through the adoption of asset and activity decisions. An ex-ante or behavioural impact \non assets occurs when households faced with the prospects of droughts or other serious \nclimate shock that would affect their welfare have no assets to rely on and thus are pushed \ninto sub-optimal risk mitigation strategies such as the adoption of low risk activities and asset \nportfolios at the expense of lower mean returns and incomes. \nHousehold behaviour in terms of investment and activity portfolios is also mediated \nby the stock of wealth available to cope with shocks. In rural Ethiopia the use of fertilisers \nusually result in higher yields and substantial returns on average. However, the application \nrates for their use between 1994 and 1999 were substantially lower due to the farmers\u2019 \ninability to cope with the consequences of droughts (i.e., when rains fail financial returns to \nfertiliser use are typically very low or negative given its sunk cost). Fertiliser application rates \nwould be up 43 percent if downside consumption risk were to be reduced by one standard \ndeviation (Dercon and Christiaensen 2005). In other words, fertiliser uptake in Ethiopia \nwould be substantially higher if some insurance were to be offered against downside \nconsumption risk thus avoiding lower short-term returns of crops in its absence. \n  Similarly, rural farmers in Tanzania grow sweet potatoes more than any other major \ncrop (sorghum, maize and cotton) despite having returns per hectare at least 25% below them. \nHouseholds grow this crop because of its high resistance to droughts becoming a low yield \nrisk, and simultaneously because no alternative consumption security mechanisms or liquid \nassets are available to them. In contrast, a household with an average livestock holding would \nhave a proportion of land allocated to sweet potatoes 20% smaller than that of a household \nwith no liquid assets. As a consequence, the crop portfolio of the richest quintile yields 25 \npercent more per adult than that of the poorest quintile (Dercon 1996). A similar conclusion \nwas reached by a study in rural South India were asset-poor households devote a larger share \nof land to rice and castor which are low-risk low value activities. If only the lowest wealth \ngroup were provided the same protection as the highest wealth group that would result in 25-\n50% higher returns per $ assets due to portfolio effects (Morduch 1990).  \n \n19\n \nReferences: \nAdams, Lesley and Geetha Nagarajan.

Some \nauthors treat the terms risk and uncertainty interchangeably (Siegel and Alwang, 1999). \n2 The distribution of exposure to hazards over the planet\u2019s surface is non-uniform. Four-fifths of the planet\u2019s \nvolcanic activity occurs in the so-called Circum-Pacific Volcanic Belt, within which are located many Asian and \nLatin American countries. The droughts that regularly follow the onset of El Ni\u00f1o years are concentrated in \nSouthern Africa and South Asia. The El Ni\u00f1o-related \u201cmalarial fringe\u201d is located along coastal regions of South \nAmerica and South Asia. On the other hand, poor people live in housing of poorer quality, and often on marginal \nland; they face liquidity constraints that limit their access to saving or insurance in the face of risk; they cannot as \nreadily escape disaster zones; their human capital is lower and more vulnerable to shocks, as when poor \nhouseholds decide to withdraw children from school so that they may earn labour income (Anderson, 2000). \n3 A strand of research called critical-period programming deals with the link between early life conditions and \noutcomes later in life. The idea is that the fetal stage and infancy are critical periods in physical development, and \nthat early-life shocks can have long-lasting effects on health. When facing low nutrition or other adverse health \nconditions, the developing fetus or infant prioritizes the brain to receive limited resources, compromising the \ndevelopment of other organ systems. The damage is to some extent irreversible, and the individual is thus \n\u2018programmed\u2019 for worse health later in life. \n4 Results are based on a model regressing the change in BMI (natural logarithm of BMI) on the previous level of \nBMI, shocks and a number of time-varying control variables, as well as controlling for fixed effect in the change in \nBMI. \n5 A third of\n those measured as grade\n II or grade III\n malnourished have some difficulty\n hoeing a field, compared\n to \nless than 15\n percent of normally nourished\n adults. Almost a quarter\n of the adults who\n are grade III malnourished\n \ncannot hoe a field.\n Other activities such as\n carrying water for a\n short distance displayed similar\n correlations. \n6 This was done linking historical rainfall for each individual\u2019s birth-year and birth-location with their current adult \noutcomes from the 2000 wave of the Indonesia Family Life Survey. \n7 Hurricane Mitch in Nicaragua affected around 19% of the population (870,000 people). Almost half (45.8%) of \nthe households surveyed in the 1999 LSMS reported their dwellings being harmed during the hurricane and, in \nfact, 29.4% had to temporarily leave their home. Furthermore, 17.3% of the affected households moved \npermanently to another residence due to Mitch (Baez and Santos, 2007). In post-tsunami Indonesia, the sector that \nexperienced most damage was housing and human settlements: 141,000 houses were destroyed, which accounts \nfor 47.9 per cent of the total damage (Telford et al., 2006).  \n8 Land located in an active river basin that is subject to erosion and accretion. \n9 This simulation was based on a model of self-insurance through savings under presence of imperfect credit \nmarkets where households maximize expected utility over time and have precautionary motives for saving (from \nwhich they receive a safe return). Also, they behave as if there was an infinite planning horizon building up assets \nin good years to draw them down when income is poor \u2013and thus leading to a time when assets get exhausted. \n10 In this analysis, households were classified according to their level of direct exposure to the flood using a \nhousehold\u2019s flood exposure index, which includes the depth of water in the homestead and in the house, and also \nthe duration (number of days) of water in the house.\n, \n11 A tropical livestock unit (TLU) is a measure that weights together different kinds of animals into cattle \nequivalents. \n12 The labor market indicator is the average off-farm labor market earnings within its community, and the capital \naccess measure was designed from a set of questions to probe if the household was price rationed in the credit \nmarket or not. \n \n \n ",

Current evidence points to the occurrence of intricate cross-talks between \npolyamines, stress hormones and other metabolic pathways required for their function. In \nthis review we integrate the polyamine metabolic pathway in the context of its immediate \nmetabolic network which is required to understand the multiple ways by which polyamines \ncan maintain their homeostasis and participate in plant stress responses.  \nKeywords: polyamines; stress; metabolism; SAM; GABA; proline; ABA \n \n1. Introduction \nAbiotic stresses such as cold/freezing, salinity, heat and drought represent serious threats to \nagriculture. Climatic change is predicted to increase global temperature, alter precipitation patterns and \nintensify drought, increasing the need to grow crops in saline soil [1,2]. Plants, which are sessile \norganisms, have evolved metabolic and hormonal pathways to cope with environmental challenges. \nThe study of this natural evolution on stress responsiveness is providing new leads to crop protection. \nIn recent years, genetic and genomic approaches have revealed complex metabolic and hormonal \nnetworks which are coordinated to provide an optimal response to stress conditions. Efforts have \ncreated network models of stress and hormone regulatory pathways, as well as the definition of \nframeworks of co-regulated target genes of abiotic stress response pathways e.g. [3]. It is generally \nrecognized that the study of stress responses must be integrated in the context of a multiple response \nOPEN ACCESSMetabolites 2012, 2                              \n \n \n517\ninvolving different plant metabolites and hormones rather than in isolated pathways. Global \ntranscriptional and metabolomic approaches very frequently recognize the participation of polyamines \n(PAs) in a large number of abiotic and biotic stresses. In this review we synthesize what is known \nabout direct interactions of PAs with other metabolic pathways during the stress response. We also \ndiscuss the dependence of PA responses on the stress hormone abscisic acid (ABA) during drought. \n2. Polyamine Biosynthesis and Its Interaction with Other Metabolic Pathways \nPAs are polycationic compounds of low molecular weight which are present in most living \norganisms [4]. The diamine putrescine (Put), triamine spermidine (Spd), tetramines spermine (Spm) \nand thermospermine (tSpm) can be found in free (Figure 1) and conjugated forms. The homeostasis of \nPAs in the cell is mainly achieved through the regulation of its biosynthesis and catabolism. However, \npolyamine (PA) conjugation in form of hydroxycinnamic acid amides such as coumaroylputrescine, \nferuloylputrescine, dicoumaroylspermidine, diferuloylspermidine or diferuloylspermine among others, \nsignificantly contributes to the regulation of free PA levels in plants [5]. Through the regulation of PA \nbiosynthesis, catabolism and conjugation, the free levels of PAs are tightly regulated and generally \nonly oscillate in response to environmental insults (e.g. stress) or during the transition between \ndifferent developmental stages (e.g. flowering). In the following sections we integrate the PA pathway \nin the context of a wider metabolic network and discuss current evidences supporting a role for PAs in \ndrought protection. \nFigure 1. Chemical structure of putrescine, spermidine, spermine and thermospermine. \nAminopropyl moieties (in red) are added to the four carbon linear chain skeleton  of \nputrescine (in blue) to produce spermidine, spermine and thermospermine. \n \n Metabolites 2012, 2                              \n \n \n518\n2.1. Biosynthesis of Putrescine. Interactions with Proline, Urea, NO and Alkaloid Biosynthesis \nThe first PA synthesized in the PA-bioynthetic pathway is Put (Figure 2). This PA can be derived \nfrom the decarboxylation of the amino acid ornithine through an enzymatic reaction catalyzed by \nornithine decarboxylase (ODC, EC 4.1.1.17; Figure 2). Whereas this enzymatic step is generally \nrecognized to be present in all living organisms, evidences are found that the model species \nArabidopsis thaliana does not have a functional ODC pathway [6]. In addition, some of the regulatory \nmechanisms involved in the regulation of ODC activity in mammals, such as the ubiquitin-independent \nproteasome degradation of ODC by a PA-induced protein called \u2018antizyme\u2019, are not found in \nplants [7,8]. Hence, it is likely that the ODC pathway, as well as the regulation of ODC activity, has \nevolved differently in plants compared to mammals, leading to an eventual loss of this pathway in \nsome plant species studied. Loss of ODC pathway might be due to the evolution of an alternative route \nto Put biosynthesis present in plants and bacteria [4], the arginine decarboxylase (ADC) pathway, \nwhich uses arginine as substrate for Put biosynthesis (Figure 2). \nFigure 2. Biosynthesis of polyamines and connections with other metabolic pathways. \nACC, aminocyclopropane carboxylic acid; ACL5, ACAULIS5 - thermospermine synthase; \nADC, arginine decarboxlase; AIH, agmatine iminohydrolase; CPA, N-carbamoylputrescine \namidohydrolase; dcSAM, decarboxylated SAM; \u03b4-OAT,  \u03b4-ornithine aminotransferase; \nODC, ornithine decarboxylase; P5CDH, pyrroline 5-carboxylate dehydrogenase; PMT, \nPutrescine N-methyltransferase; SAM, S-adenosylmethionine; SAMDC,   \nS-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase; SPDS, spermidine synthase; SMPS,   \nspermine synthase. \n \nArginine to put conversion requires three consecutive enzymatic reactions (Figure 2). The first step \nis the enzymatic decarboxylation of arginine by ADC (EC. 4.1.1.19). The product of this enzymatic \nreaction is agmatine, which serves as substrate for agmatine iminohydrolases (AIH, EC. 3.4.3.12) to \nproduce N-carbamoyl-Put. The final step in the ADC pathway is the hydrolysis of N-carbamoyl-Put to \nPut by N-carbamoyl-Put amidohydrolases (CPA, EC 3.5.1.53). Despite the need of three consecutive Metabolites 2012, 2                              \n \n \n519\nenzymatic reactions for the arginine to Put conversion, evidences indicate that the limiting enzyme in \nPut biosynthesis is ADC [4,9]. Hence, manipulation of Put biosynthesis in plants can be achieved by \nthe genetic manipulation of ADC activity such as over-expression of ADC encoding genes. In this \nway, plants accumulating high levels of endogenous Put have been generated and showed enhanced \nresistance to drought and freezing stresses [4,9,10]. Except for few cases [9], increases in Put levels \nachieved by overexpression of ADC are moderate which suggests the occurrence of   \npost-transcriptional regulation of ADC, transformation of Put to higher PAs (e.g. Spd, Spm and tSpm), \ncatabolism/conjugation, among others mechanisms to maintain Put homeostasis. \nEven though ADC and ODC use different substrates, both pathways for Put biosynthesis are \nconnected by arginase, an enzyme that converts arginine to ornithine. Arabidopsis thaliana contains \ntwo genes coding for arginase (ARGAH1 and ARGAH2) which can complement the yeast arginase \ndeficient (car1) mutant [11]. The expression of ARGAH1 is restricted to pollen whereas ARGAH2 \nexpression is induced in leaves by treatment with methyl jasmonate  [12]. Flores et al.  [13] also \nreported ARGAH1 and ARGAH2 expression in expanded cotyledons and root vasculature of young \nseedlings, especially in response to the synthetic auxin NAA. ARGAH2 is a major contributor to \narginase activity in seedlings and both ARGAH1 and ARGAH2 are localized to the mitochondrial \nmatrix [13].  Interestingly, over-expression of ARGAH2 in Arabidopsis thaliana leads to enhanced \nresistance to Botrytis cinerea, thus suggesting a role for arginase in the biotic stress responses to \nnecrotrophic pathogens at least in this species [14].  \nThe hydrolisis of arginine to ornithine is also a source of urea [15] (Figure 2). The ornithine formed \nby arginase activity can be used for PA biosynthesis in plants provided with an ODC pathway. \nAlternatively, ornithine can be converted again into arginine through the urea cycle. Another metabolic \npathway for ornithine is its catabolism through the activity of ornithine-\u03b4-aminotransferases (\u03b4-OAT, \nFigure 2). In this enzymatic reaction, the side chain amino group of ornithine is transferred to   \n\u03b1-ketoglutarate to generate glutamate and pyrroline 5-carboxylate. The latter compound can be \noxidized to glutamate by pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase (P5CDH) or alternatively, be reduced \nby NADPH to generate proline (Figure 2). However, it is still controversial the contribution of \u03b4-OAT \nto proline levels since oat mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana do not show altered proline levels under \nstress [16]. Therefore, it is more likely that the final product from \u03b4-OAT activity is glutamate rather \nthan proline. The urea released by arginase activity is exported to the cytosol and hydrolized by \ncytosolic ureases to ammonia (Figure 2). Ammonia is then re-assimilated by cytosolic glutamine \nsynthetases to glutamine using the glutamate derived from \u03b4-OAT catabolism (Figure 2).  \nOverexpression of ARGAH2 in Arabidopsis thaliana has been shown to lead to increased arginase \nactivity and reduced arginine levels which did not result in lower PA levels [14]. This might be the \nconsequence of the reallocation of free and conjugated PA forms, inhibition of PA catabolism, its \ntransport or other mechanistic processes by which plants maintain PA levels under strict control. The \nrequirement of a minimum PA pool for cell survival likely underlies its tight homeostasis   \nregulation [4]. Interestingly, even though \u03b4-OAT activity does not necessarily lead to increased proline \nlevels [16], overexpression of ARGAH2 lead to increased proline in some lines [14]. Further genetic \nanalyses would be required to better define the metabolic interaction between arginine and proline \nmediated by \u03b4-OAT. Metabolites 2012, 2                              \n \n \n520\nIn animal cells, arginine is also susbtrate for nitric oxide synthases (NOS) which produce nitric \noxide (NO). Nitric oxide plays important roles in the regulation of stomatal movements in response to \nABA and is an integral part in many defense and developmental pathways. Although the identification \nof a NOS orthologue gene in plants that would link arginine to NO biosynthesis is missing [17,18] \nsome reports evidence that PAs, and particularly Spm, induce a rapid NO production without lag [19]. \nIncreased NO observed in arginase mutants argah1-1 and argah2-1 has been suggested to derive from \nan increased availability of arginine for PA biosynthesis [13]. The source for NO production induced \nby PAs still remains to be elucidated [20].  \nIn the crossroad of PAs with other metabolic pathways, the interaction of Put with secondary \nmetabolism is well established in some plants. The enzyme Putrescine N-methyltransferase (PMT, \nFigure 2) catalyzes the methylation of Put using SAM as methyl donor. The product of this enzymatic \nreaction, N-methyl putrescine, is required for the synthesis of nicotine, tropane and nortropane \nalkaloids in Solanaceae and Convolvulaceae plants [21]. \n2.2. Biosynthesis of Spermidine, Spermine and Thermospermine. Interactions with  \nS-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and ethylene \nHigher molecular weight PAs spermidine and spermine are synthesized by the sequential addition \nof aminopropyl moieties to the four carbon linear chain skeleton of Put (Figure 1) through enzymatic \nreactions catalyzed by Spd and Spm synthases, respectively (SPDS, EC 2.5.1.16 and SPMS, EC \n2.5.1.22; Figure 2).  \nThe donor of aminopropyl groups is decarboxylated S-adenosyl methionine (dcSAM) which is \nsynthesized from decarboxylation of S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) by SAM decarboxylases \n(SAMDC, EC 4.1.1.50; Figure 2). The availability of dcSAM limits the biosynthesis of Spd and   \nSpm [22]. This makes SAMDC one of the major regulators of the PA biosynthetic pathway. \nFurthermore, SAMDC competes for SAM, which is used as universal methyl donor in many enzymatic \nreactions involving O-,  N- and C-methyltransferases in primary and secondary metabolism [23]. \ndcSAM can only be used for PA biosynthesis and therefore, the regulation of SAMDC activity is likely \nto be relevant in the context of a complex metabolic network. Indeed, the transcriptional regulation and \nbiochemical properties of SAMDCs are tightly regulated and have been extensively studied [24]. As \nanticipated, SAM is precursor of other metabolites in plants. Relevant for crop stress protection against \nnutritional deficiency is the requirement of SAM for the synthesis of nicotianamine by nicotianamine \nsynthase [25]. Nicotianamine is a strong chelator of iron and in graminaceous plants is precursor of \nphytosiderophores required for iron uptake from soil [26]. Nevertheless, a potential interaction \nbetween PA biosynthesis and iron uptake efficiency is unknown. SAM is also substrate for ethylene \nbiosynthesis in higher plants (Figure 2). The enzyme 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) \nsynthase converts SAM to ACC, which is oxidized by ACC oxidase to ethylene [27,28]. Hence, PAs \nand ethylene could act in an antagonistic manner competing for the common substrate SAM. Whereas \nethylene would contribute to senescence and fruit ripening, PAs would favor growth and inhibit \nsenescence [29]. Indeed, anti-senescent properties of PAs are well documented [30]. Some of the  \nPA-related antisenescence effects might be due to the PA-mediated inhibition of ethylene biosynthesis. \nIndeed, examples are found in literature that the exogenous application of PAs inhibits ethylene Metabolites 2012, 2                              \n \n \n521\nbiosynthesis [31\u201333]. In tomato, PAs have been shown to inhibit the induction of ACC synthase by \nwounding [34]. In carnation flowers [35] the blockage of SAM to ACC conversion was translated in an \nincrease of Spm levels whereas impairment of PA biosynthesis promoted ethylene pathway and \nsenescence. However, most of these analyses are based on exogenous applications of PAs, ethylene \nand their inhibitors which have some intrinsic limitations. Furthermore, the antagonistic effect between \nPAs and ethylene is not always observable. Mehta et al. [36] reported that tomato plants transformed \nwith yeast SAMDC under the control of the ripening specific E8 promoter synthesized more ethylene \nand PAs concomitantly during fruit ripening, thus evidencing the absence for SAM competition in this \nsystem. Initial studies already pointed to other mechanisms rather than a mere metabolic competition \nfor SAM involved in the PA-ethylene antagonism [31\u201333] although scarce attention has been taken in \nthe recent years to the PA-ethylene crosstalk. In a recent work, overexpression of yeast Spermidine \nSynthase in tomato has been shown to produce plants susceptible to the fungal necrotroph Botritis \ncynerea concomitantly to a repression of ethylene biosynthesis and signaling, thus providing support to \nthe view that PA-ethylene cross-regulation occurs and has important implications for defense [37]. \nFurther analyses would be required to identify the interacting nodes in this PA-ethylene   \ncross-regulation. \n2.3. Put to Spm Canalization and Its Contribution to Stress Protection \nHigher PAs, Spd and Spm have been shown to significantly contribute to abiotic stress protection \nalthough their specific mechanism(s) of action remain to be elucidated. Some of the genetic evidences \nhave been obtained from the analysis of loss-of-function mutations in Arabidopsis thaliana. This \nspecies carries two genes coding for Spd Synthase (SPDS1 and SPDS2), and one Spm Synthase \n(SPMS) [4]. Interestingly, Arabidopsis thaliana also contains one gene (ACAULIS5, ACL5) coding for \nthermospermine synthase, an enzyme involved in the synthesis of the Spm isomer thermospermine \n(tSpm) [38]. Regardless of its low levels, tSpm is required for proper vascular tissue development and \nstem elongation, phenotypes which are evidenced in the acl5 mutant [39]. The spms-1 mutant impared \nin Spm biosynthesis has no evident morphological alterations and it is viable [40]. The double   \nspms-1/acl5-1 mutant lacking both Spm and tSpm is also viable and shows an acl5-1 phenotype \n[39,40]. However, impairment of Put or Spd biosynthesis leads to embryo lethality [41,42]. Consistent \nwith a protective role of Spm and/or tSpm under abiotic stress, the double spms-1/acl5-1 mutant has \nalso been reported to exhibit enhanced sensitivity to drought and salinity [43,44]. A potential role for \ntSpm in biotic stress protection in Arabidopsis thaliana has recently been proposed [45]. \nIn a recent report [46], a Put to Spm metabolic canalization in response to drought was revealed in \nArabidopsis thaliana and the resurrection plant Craterostigma plantagineum. In this work, the levels \nof PAs were analyzed in response to drought in Arabidopsis thaliana mutants impaired at different \nsteps of the PA biosynthetic pathway. This approach allowed monitoring the accumulation of PAs \nduring the course of dehydration. In this way, it could be revealed that even though Arabidopsis \nthaliana wild type plants do not accumulate Spd or Spm in response to drought, a Put to Spm \ncanalization occurs which is not translated in Spd or Spm increases. Conversely, the drought tolerant \nspecies  Craterostigma plantagineum showed dramatic increases in Spd and Spm contents that \ncorrelated with drought tolerance. Put to Spm metabolic canalization seems to be a conserved Metabolites 2012, 2                              \n \n \n522\nmechanism between species, whereas the ability to accumulate high Spd and Spm levels (e.g. by \ninhibition of its oxidation) may discern between drought tolerant and intolerant species. \n3. Polyamine Catabolism. Interactions with GABA \nPAs are oxidatively deaminated by the action of amine oxidases. Diamine oxidases (DAOs) are \ncopper-containing amine oxidases (CuAO) which oxidize the diamines Put and cadaverine at the \nprimary amino groups. 4-aminobutanal is produced from the oxidation of Put by DAO activities, \nconcomitantly with the release of ammonia and hydrogen peroxide (Figure 3). Other class of amine \noxidases are flavin-containing polyamine oxidases (PAO) involved in the terminal catabolism of Spd \nand Spm producing 4-aminobutanal or N-(3-aminopropyl)-4-aminobutanal, 1,3-diaminopropane and \nH2O2 [47,48] (Figure 3). Another group of PAOs are involved in the back-conversion of Spm to Spd \nwith concomitant production of 3-aminopropanal and H2O2 [48]. 4-aminobutanal produced in Put \ncatabolism by DAO and terminal catabolism of Spd can be converted to \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) \nvia \u03941-pyrroline. It is well established the role of GABA as neurotransmitter in animal cells. In plants, \nincreases in GABA levels have been reported in response to different stresses [49] and GABA is \nsuggested to contribute to stress protection through the regulation of cellular pH, acting as \nosmoregulator or as signaling molecule in plants [50]. However, most of the roles for GABA under \nstress still need to be defined. In soybean roots exposed to salinity, the degradation of PAs has been \nassociated with increased levels of GABA [51]. Conversely, during the recovery from stress, the levels \nof GABA are reduced concomitantly to an increase of PAs. [51] These observations suggest that PA \ncatabolism might contribute to increase GABA levels during salinity. \nPA oxidation is a source of H2O2 in the apoplast which can contribute to the defense response \nagainst pathogens [47]. Evidences are found that some PAOs participate in the hypersensitive response \n(HR) in Nicotiana tabacum plants resistant to tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). Inhibition of PAO activity \nby guazatine reduced HR symptoms in TMV infected plants [52]. In a more recent work, H2O2 derived \nfrom PA catabolism has also been associated with non-host induced HR in tobacco, thus leading to the \nview that PAs could participate in both host and non-host induced HR [53]. \n   Metabolites 2012, 2                              \n \n \n523\nFigure 3. Polyamine catabolism mediated by CuAOs (copper amine oxidases) and PAOs \n(polyamine oxidases) in plants. \n \n4. ABA Dependence of PA-Responses under Drought \nAbscisic acid (ABA) is a key hormone with important roles in abiotic stress  [54]. Many   \ndrought-inducible genes are responsive to ABA, but also ABA-independent pathways are activated in \nresponse to drought conditions. In order to determine the involvement of ABA in the transcriptional \nregulation of the PA biosynthetic pathway in response to drought, Alc\u00e1zar et al. [55] analyzed the \nexpression of PA biosynthesis genes ADC1, ADC2, AIH, CPA, SPDS1, SPDS2, SPMS, ACL5, \nSAMDC1 and SAMDC2 in Arabidopsis thaliana wild type plants and mutants impaired in ABA \nbiosynthesis (aba2-3) or signaling (abi1-1). ADC2, SPDS1 and SPMS genes were among the most \nresponsive ones to drought stress [55]. The increased expression of these three PA biosynthesis genes \nsuggested a potential role for ADC2, SPDS1 and SPMS in the drought response. Interestingly, whereas \nADC2 and SPDS1 expression increased several fold by drought treatment, the expression of their gene \nparalogs, ADC1 and SPDS2, did not change substantially [55]. These observations are consistent with \nthe acquisition of certain stress-specificity, probably due to divergent evolution of cis- regulatory \nelements in their promoters. Indeed, different cis elements are found in the promoters of PA \nbiosynthesis genes [39,56]. ABA-responsive elements (ABRE) or ABRE-related motifs are also found \nin the promoters of ADC2, SPDS1 and SPMS [56], which are highly up-regulated in response to \ndrought [55]. The analysis in aba2-3 and abi1-1 mutants showed much more moderate increases in \nADC2, SPDS1 and SPMS expression [55]. These results evidenced that transcriptional up-regulation of \nADC2, SDPS1 and SPMS by drought is mediated by ABA. Hence, ABA is an upstream regulator of \nPA biosynthesis in response to drought. To determine the effect of the transcriptional regulation of PA \nbiosynthesis genes on PA levels, the content of Put, Spd and Spm levels in response to drought were \nalso analyzed. Wild type plants showed a progressive accumulation of Put in response to drought Metabolites 2012, 2                              \n \n \n524\nconditions, whereas this accumulation was absent in aba2-3 and abi1-1 [55]. Hence, the ABA-\ndependent up-regulation in ADC2 expression observed under drought leads to an effective Put \naccumulation. In a recent work, Alc\u00e1zar et al. [10] determined a role for ADC2 overexpression in \nconferring drought tolerance by transformation of A. thaliana plants with the homologous ADC2 gene \nunder the constitutive CaMV 35s promoter. The different lines analyzed showed contrasting degrees of \nADC2 expression and Put accumulation [9]. Total Put content was between 12- and 2-fold higher than \nwild type depending on the transgenic line [9,10]. Interestingly, plants that accumulated higher levels \nof Put were more resistant to drought stress and the enhanced drought tolerance correlated with a \nreduced stomata aperture and transpiration rate [10].  \n5. Future Perspectives \nThe polyamine field is complex. First because PAs have multiple roles acquired during evolution \nand it is difficult to disentangle one from the other to study them in isolation. Lethality due to depletion \nof PA levels is a good example of the intrinsic difficulties of addressing functional questions. To gain a \nfurther insight into this topic, we believe that it is necessary to study the interconnections of PA \nbiosynthesis, degradation and conjugation with other metabolic routes in depth and place these \ncompounds in the context of a full metabolic and signaling network. We still need to address where \nPAs localize, where they are required for their function, how they are transported from sources to sinks \n(and also which are the sources and the sinks) and more importantly, whether PAs are intermediary \ncompounds in the stress protection or have a role themselves. We believe that a detailed metabolic and \nsignaling analysis addressing these and other fundamental questions is needed to provide a broader \nview about the roles and mechanisms of PAs during stress. \nAcknowledgments \nWe apologize to authors whose work has not been cited here owing to space limitations.

Further,  some  of  our  analyses  are  quantitative  based  on \npublished and unpublished work that is ongoing at Purdue University, while other analyses are \nqualitative based on \u201cexpert opinion.\u201d While further research will always bring further clarity, \nwe hope that these initial analyses provide a reliable indication of the direction and magnitude of \nimportant climate change impacts and opportunities in Indiana. \n \nShould greenhouse gas concentrations continue to increase, Indiana faces a number of \npotential impacts: \n \n\u2022 The occurrence of extreme hot events is likely to increase in Indiana, while the occurrence of \nextreme cold events is likely to decrease. \n \n\u2022 The occurrence of conditions that spawn severe thunderstorms is likely to increase in Indiana. \n \n\u2022 Annual average precipitation is likely to increase in the region, as is the occurrence of rain \nduring the winter and early spring, resulting in higher streamflow and an increased likelihood of \nflooding.  \n \n\u2022 An increase in the frequency and intensity of summer storms is likely to increase the frequency \nof flooding events and exacerbate summer soil moisture deficits in Indiana. \n \n\u2022 Vulnerability of soils to dry winters could increase the risk of multi-year droughts in Indiana. \n \n\u2022 The corn belt will likely remain the best area for corn and soybean production and Indiana will \nlikely maintain its position as a top producer of those crops. \n \n\u2022 Heavier rainfall and periodic flooding during planting and harvest periods may lead to crop \nlosses in Indiana, as well as increased pest and disease burdens.  \n \n\u2022 The pace of climate change relative to the rate of technological change will be an important \ndeterminant of agricultural impacts and outcomes in Indiana. \n \n\u2022 Climate change could have deleterious affects on mussels, fish and amphibians in Indiana, \nseveral of which are endangered. There exist considerable uncertainties as to how climate change \nmany impact bird life histories and distributions in Indiana. \n \n\u2022 High value hardwoods are potentially threatened in Indiana.  \n \n\u2022 Should climate in Indiana shift to \u201chotter, drier summers\u201d and \u201cwarmer, wetter winters,\u201d the \nloss of soil organic matter is likely to increase.   2 \n \n\u2022 Decreases in cold-related health stress in  Indiana could overcome increases in heat-related \nhealth stress. However, the occurrence of air stagnation events is likely to increase in Indiana, \npotentially increasing the occurrence of pollution events that impact human health. \n \n\u2022  Decreases  in  heating  demand  in  Indiana  could  overcome  increases  in  cooling  demand. \nHowever, quantification of how these changes in demand will influence actual energy usage and \nemissions requires further analysis. \n \n \nIndiana faces potential opportunities and consequences in emerging carbon offset markets: \n \n\u2022 Purdue University has produced a highly detailed inventory of all fossil fuel carbon dioxide \nemissions for the United States and the state of Indiana. This will meet many of the climate \nregistry goals of S.2191. This is a key contribution that the state can make to the integrity of this \nlegislation. \n \n\u2022 Indiana has considerable opportunity to accrue offset credits in the agricultural sector. Many of \nthese  opportunities  come  with  co-benefits.  However,  some  of  these  credits  depend  upon  the \nopportunity cost of cropland. \n \n\u2022 Land cover changes created by offset markets could directly alter surface climate in Indiana. \n \n \nThis document reflects the analysis, understanding, and opinions of the authors, and does not \nreflect official policy of Purdue University.   3 \n \nFigure  A1.

Likely Climate Changes in Indiana \nNoah Diffenbaugh, Dept. of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences; Michael Baldwin, Dept. of Earth \nand Atmospheric Sciences; Robert Trapp, Dept. of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences \n \n \nTemperature \nThe  occurrence  and  duration  of  extreme \nhot events is likely to increase throughout \nthe  United  States  should  greenhouse  gas \nconcentrations  continue  to  rise  (e.g., \n(Diffenbaugh  et  al.  2005)).  In  Indiana, \ntemperatures  that  now  occur  during  the \nhottest  two-and-a-half  weeks  of  the  year \nare likely to occur for seven to ten weeks \n((Diffenbaugh et al. 2005), and Figure A1). \nThe increases in southern Indiana represent \nan  increase  of  more  than  200%  (or  a \ntripling) over present conditions. \n \n \nConversely, the frequency and severity of \nextreme  cold  events  is  likely  to  decrease \nthroughout the United States (Diffenbaugh \net al. 2005). Indiana could see some of the largest warming of extreme cold temperatures, with \nthe coldest events of the year warming by up to 10 \u02daC by the end of this century under the SRES \nA2 emissions scenario ((Diffenbaugh et al. 2005), and Figure A1). \n \n \n \nPrecipitation \nTotal  annual  precipitation  and  extreme \nprecipitation are likely to increase over much \nof  the  United  States  should  greenhouse  gas \nconcentrations  continue  to  increase  (e.g., \n(Diffenbaugh  et  al.  2005)).  Total  annual \nprecipitation  could  increase  up  to  20%  over \nnorthern  Indiana  (see  Figure  A2).  Extreme \nprecipitation events could increase up to 40% \nover northern and southern Indiana. \n \nWe have also conducted the first quantification \nof  the  potential  response  of  severe  weather \nenvironments  in  the  United  States  to \nanthropogenic  increases  in  greenhouse  gas \nconcentrations  (Trapp  et  al.,  2007).

The increase in total warm-season occurrence over Indiana reaches up \nto 50 % relative to the present conditions. In the Midwest, these increases in severe weather \nenvironments occur largely during what is now the peak severe weather season (Trapp et al., \n2007, and Figure A4). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   5 \nB.  Likely Impacts of Climate Change on Water Resources in Indiana \nKeith Cherkauer, Dept. of Agricultural and Biological Engineering \n \nAnnual and seasonal precipitation  \nWhile precipitation is likely to increase on an annual average basis, there is likely to be a shift in \nthe seasonality of that precipitation, with winter and spring precipitation increasing by 21 and \n30% by the end of the century, and summer precipitation declining by up to 9% (Figure B1).     \nSuch  a  shift  may  result  in  the  increased  precipitation  being  of  minimal  use  to  crops  but  of \nsignificant concern for flooding.  Wetter winters, the product of more precipitation and warmer \nair temperatures, may result in an increased frequency of floods like that on the Tippecanoe and \nWabash  Rivers  this  past  January  (Figure  B2)  a  direct  result  of  the  ~100mm  (~4in)  of \nprecipitation that fell within 24 hours.  Reduced summer precipitation may impact crop growth, \nthough the overall change in quantity is not great (a maximum forecasted decrease of 25 mm (1 \nin)). A bigger concern may be in the timing of that precipitation.  Several sources forecast an \nincrease  in  serve  weather  in  the  area  (e.g.  Kling  et  al.  2003),  which  would  produce  more \nintensive rainfalls, contributing to increases in summer flooding while leaving soils even drier. \n \nSPRING \n \n \n                      SUMMER \n \nFigure B1. Projected changes in annual average spring and summer precipitation (in units of percentage \nchange relative to 1961-1990 averages) as simulated by the VIC hydrological model under the higher \n(A1fi) and lower (B1) emissions scenarios.

Images  from  the  Tippecanoe  River  flood  of  January  2008:  (a)  7-day  precipitation \naccumulation showing the between 75 and 100mm of precipitation in the river basin, most falling on \nJanuary 8, 2008 (Source: National Weather Service); (b) Tippecanoe River discharge at the downstream \nmost station in the days after the flood peak (Source: National Weather Service); (c) Norway Bridge over \nthe Tippecanoe River in White County; and (d) Indiana 225 bridge over the Wabash River near Battle \nGround. \n \nWinter Processes \nAs winter temperatures have warmed across the region, more precipitation has been falling as \nrain  and  less  as  snow,  though  only  the  decrease  in  northern  Indiana  has  been  found  to  be \nstatistically significant (Sinha and Cherkauer, 2008).  This suggests that despite increased winter \nair temperatures, snow accumulation has remained relatively constant because of increases in \nwinter precipitation.  Additionally at the same northern Indiana location the occurrence of soil \nfrost has increased significantly.  This is likely a short-term response to the decrease in surface \ninsulation afforded by thinning snow cover.  As air temperatures continue to increase this effect \nis expected to reverse itself leading to a decrease in seasonally frozen soil.   7 \nClimate projections suggest that the number of days with snowfall and the amount of snowfall is \nnot going to change significantly in the future (Kling et al. 2003) as winters will be wetter so the \nfrequency of precipitation and freezing temperatures occurring simultaneously will remain about \nthe same as it has been historically.  However, increased air temperatures will reduce the length \nof time that snow cover is present in the state by between 11 and 16 days by the end of the \ncentury (Figure B3). The first day of snow cover will come on the order of two weeks later and \nthe last day of snow cover will arrive about two weeks earlier by the end of the century (Figure \nB3). \nWhile there is the potential for soil frost to become more significant in the near future because of \nthe reduction of snow cover, by the end of the century the number of days with soil frost will be \nreduced by between 37 and 56 days (Figure B3). Soils will first freeze substantially between one \nand three weeks later then they currently do.  Thaw, which is an important part of having soils \nready for planting in the spring, will shift earlier by two to almost four weeks (Figure B3).    \n(a) Number of Snow-Covered Days \n \n \n(b) Number of days with soil frost \n(c)\nFigure B3. Projected future change in (a) the number of snow-covered days per year, and (b) the length \nof the soil frost season, relative to the 1961-1990 average for the higher (A1fi) and lower (B1) emission \nscenarios as simulated by the VIC model driven by downscaled projections from the GFDL, HadCM3 and \nPCM models.   \n \nEvapotranspiration \nChanges in annual average evapotranspiration (ET) are projected to be small, on the order of a \n1% increase.  The magnitude of this change is very important as it controls how much of the \nincreased  precipitation  is  left  to  refill  soil  moisture  levels  and  contribute  to  increases  in \nstreamflow.  Such a small change is attributed to more water being available in the winter and \nspring when ET rates are low and soil moisture is typically high, so changes will be minimal.    8 \nThe fact that ET is projected to increase is a testament to increases in spring ET and wetter soils \nin early summer alleviating some if not all of the effects of drier summers. \n \nTotal runoff  \nTotal runoff, the sum of direct surface flow and baseflow (groundwater return flows), is the \namount of water available for streamflow.  It is projected to increase annually by between 25 and \n38% (Figure B4) by the end of the century. Seasonally, the largest percent increases (33-59%) in \ntotal runoff occur in the winter and spring (32-39%), however, the spring increase is nearly \ndouble the volume of the winter increase. Summer total runoff is also projected to increase by \n24%, but this is due to increases in baseflow (33-37%) resulting from a wetter spring. Summer \nsurface runoff actually decreases by up to 8%. Changes in autumn total runoff are mixed and \nhighly susceptible to the amount of precipitation received in the summer, so changes in autumn \nflow are a direct reflection of whether summer ended with enough precipitation to compensate \nfor evaporative losses. \n \n (a) Change in Annual Total Runoff \n \n \n(b) Change in Annual Soil Water Storage \n \nFigure  B4.  Projected  future  change  in  (a)  cumulative  total  runoff,  and  (b)  soil  column  moisture. \nProjected  changes  shown  relative  to  the  1961-1990  average  for  the  higher  (A1fi)  and  lower  (B1) \nscenarios as simulated by the VIC hydrological model driven by downscaled projections from the GFDL, \nHadCM3 and PCM climate models. \n \n \n \n   9 \nSoil moisture \nStorage of water in the soil column is projected to increase by only 1-2% annually by the end of \nthe century  (Figure B4). Autumn soil moisture storage is projected to decrease or stay the same \nby the end of the century, while the other three seasons may see increases of up to 2.4%.  Winter \nand spring soil moisture reflect both the increase in precipitation, but also the reduction of snow \ncover and soil frost which will increase infiltration throughout both seasons. The increase in \nsummer  soil  moisture  is  a  reflection  in  the  wetter  conditions  in  spring  and  early  summer.  \nIncreases in autumn and winter precipitation mean that soil moisture has generally recovered \nfrom autumn deficits prior to the following spring, but if precipitation is on the low end during \nthese seasons, the potential for multi-year drought increases.  \nThe distribution of daily flows (Figure B5) shows that flows increase most substantially in the \nspring.  Winter flows also increase significantly, but continue to be smaller than spring flows.   \n \n \n(a) A1fi Effects at West Lafayette \n \n \n(b) B1 Effects at West Lafayette \n \n(c) A1fi Effects at Mt.

Streamflows are for the higher (A1fi) and lower (B1) scenarios as simulated by the VIC \nhydrological  model  driven  by  downscaled  projections  from  the  GFDL,  HadCM3  and  PCM  climate \nmodels.   10 \nSummer  and  autumn  flows  do  not  change  significantly,  or  consistently  between  model \nsimulations.  The one exception being that summer maximum flows increase for the Wabash for \nboth gauge sites and both future change scenarios. \n \nThe trends shown here agree with projections made for large river basins throughout the United \nStates (Milly et al. 2005), where 62% of 24 climate projections indicate that the Ohio River basin \nwill  experience  an  increase  in  runoff  of  5  to  10%  by  the  period  2041-2060.    The  upper \nMississippi River is also projected to experience runoff increases, but by only 2 to 5% and the \nGreat  Lakes  region  is  not  expected  to  experience  any  significant  change.    The  latter  result \ncontributes to the minimal drop (at most 2 ft) in lake levels projected for Lake Michigan in the \ncurrent century.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   11 \nC.  Likely Impacts of Climate Change on Agriculture in Indiana \nGerald  Shively,  Dept.  of  Agricultural  Economics;  Otto  Doering,  Dept.  of  Agricultural \nEconomics;  Noah Diffenbaugh, Dept. of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences; Laura Bowling, Dept. \nof Agronomy; Christian Krupke, Dept. of Entomology; Bryan Pijanowski, Dept. of Forestry and \nNatural  Resources;  Jeff  Holland,  Dept,  of  Entomology;  John  \u201cBarny\u201d  Dunning,  Dept.  of \nForestry and Natural Resources \n \nOverview \nIndiana is among the top US producers of corn and soybeans. Under all likely climate scenarios, \nthe corn belt will remain the best area for corn and soybean production and Indiana will maintain \nits position as a top producer of these crops. The state also has important production of other \ncrops,  and  also  of  poultry  and  livestock.  Predicting  the  impact  of  climate  change  on  these \nsystems is somewhat more difficult because less research attention has been focused on these \nparts of the agricultural industry.  \n \nThe major climate-related drivers of agricultural outcomes will be changes in (i) atmospheric \nCO2 and nitrogen, (ii) temperature, (iii) precipitation, (iv) pests and pathogens, and (v) extreme \nevents.   \n \n\u2022    Projected increases in temperature will increase the length of Indiana's growing season. \nThis, combined with increases in atmospheric CO2 and nitrogen will increase the productivity of \nmost annual crops, including corn and soybeans.   Livestock populations may be stressed due to \nhigher temperatures, especially during warmers summer months. \n \n\u2022   As highlighted in other parts of this report, the distribution of precipitation across the \nyear is expected to shift, leading to wetter winters and dryer summers. In addition, the inability \nof rainfall to compensate for increased heat may lead to more drying. This is likely to be most \npronounced in summer, leading to dryer soils and more drought-like conditions. To the extent the \nagricultural  industry  is  unable  to  compensate  through  the  development  of  improved  genetic \nvarieties that exhibit drought tolerance, productivity will decline.  Although one might expect \nirrigation  to  fill  water  needs,  given  current  crop  genetics,  and  associated  rates  of  crop \nevapotranspiration, investments in irrigation infrastructure are not likely to compensate for the \ncombined forces of greater heat and less moisture. As a result, the key adaptation mechanisms \nfor farmers will be to shift planting dates and adopt crop varieties with shorter growing seasons \nso as to avoid the hottest parts of the growing season.  Farmers will have to avoid the deleterious \neffects of climate change and take advantage of climate conditions that are more conducive to \ncrop growth. Heavier rainfall and periodic flooding during planting and harvest periods may lead \nto crop losses.   \n \n\u2022   Climate changes are likely to allow more successful overwintering of several pests and \ndiseases, and to also allow for the expansion of pests and pathogens. Heat and moisture stress \ncan  make  crops  and  animals  more  susceptible  to  pests  and  diseases.  To  some  extent, \nimprovements  in  crop  and  animal  genetics  may  compensate. \n \n\u00b7  Increases  in  extreme  rainfall  and  heat  events  are  likely.  These  will  stress  crop  and \nlivestock systems above and beyond the impacts listed above.  Extreme rainfall events may lead   12 \nto greater soil erosion and agricultural runoff, with concomitant increases in off-site damages \nassociated with sediment, nutrient, chemical, and pathogen loads. These effects are discussed \nelsewhere in this report. \n \n\u00b7  Although perennial systems (e.g. fruit trees and grape production) are not a large part of \nIndiana agriculture, they are locally important in some areas. By virtue of their permanent nature, \nproducers may find it more problematic to adjust their production practices. As a result, these \nsystems may be more vulnerable to the stresses outlined above. \n \n\u00b7  Technology  responses,  especially  development  of  new  crop  genetics,  will  be  key \nconditioning factors. The pace of climate change relative to the rate of technological change will \nbe an important determinant of agricultural impacts and outcomes. \n \nCrop Phenology \nThe  VIC  model,  in  this  case  forced  with  only  the  HadCM3  future  climate  projections  and \ncoupled to a simple crop growth model, is used to assess changes in earliest planting date and \ngrowing degree days.  Earliest planting dates are based on when air temperature has been > 10 \noC \n(50 \noF) for 5 or more days, soil temperature has been > 12.8 \noC (12 \noF) for 3 or more days, and \nsoil moisture has been < field capacity for 3 or more days.  Additionally, rain cannot occur on the \ndate of planting.  Growing degree days are based on accumulated temperatures in excess of 10 \noC, and must exceed 1250 for typical corn crops.   \nChanges are best interpreted relative to the model base climatology; in general there is little \ndifference between the A1 and B1 scenarios by mid-century.  Planting dates show the greatest \nchange in the northern part of the state, probably due to soil moisture (Figure C1).  Possible \nplanting dates move forward by about 1 week by mid-century, 1-2 weeks by century end.  For \nthe base period (1960-1989), planting never occurs in a few years indicating some problems with \nmodel setup.  Changes in crop maturity dates follow the patterns and magnitudes of planting \nchanges, by mid-century maturity advances by 5-10 days.   \n \nHigh Emission \n \nLow Emission \n \nFigure C1.

The colors indicate the number of years (out \nof 24) in which the thermal regime is appropriate \nfor  production.  Decreases  in  producible area  are \ndriven primarily by increases in severely hot days \nin the 21\nst century (as shown in White et al., 2006). \nHigh Emission \n \nLow Emission \n \nFigure C2. Growing degree days (x10) as simulated by the VIC model driven by downscaled projections  \n \nTotal  growing  season  length  (gdd10, \naccumulated  until  soil  frost)  increases  by  200-\n400 degree-days by mid-century and 400 degree-\ndays by century end (C2). \n \nBesides the previously mentioned problems with \ncrops  not  getting  planted  in  some  years,  these \npreliminary  simulations  also  had  difficulty \ntriggering  harvest  in  almost  all  years  for  all \nperiods.  This suggests that hydrometeorological \nprediction of harvest needs significant work, but \nmay  also  indicate  potential  problems  with \nadequate  drying  of  crops  under  future  climate \nscenarios.  Additionally, these simulations do not \naccount for changes in hybrids or crop types that \nmight result from adaptation to climate changes. \n \nEffects of Temperature Extremes \nChanges in the distribution of daily temperature \nand precipitation events can lead to widespread \nchanges in the exceedance of critical thresholds \n(White  et  al.  2006,  Diffenbaugh  et  al.  2007, \nTrapp et al. 2007).  Indeed, recent modeling of \nthe  effects  of  21\nst-century  climate  change  on \nagriculture  suggest  that  changes  in  the \noccurrence of severe events could be the primary \ndriver of crop response, with agricultural yields \nshowing little sensitivity to projected changes in \nmean  growing  season  temperature  and  heat \naccumulation but dramatic sensitivity to the coincident changes in temperature extremes (White \n1960-1989  2020-2049  1960-1989  2020-2049  2070-2099   14 \n \nFigure C4. Distribution of migratory and non-migratory pest taxa. \nNumber of suitable years (of 24 possible) for the current (top \npanels) and future (bottom panels) climates. Armyworm and corn \nearworm are migratory taxa. European corn borer, northern corn \nrootworm, and western corn rootworm are non-migratory taxa. \nFrom Diffenbaugh, Krupke, et al., in preparation. \net al. 2006). This point is illustrated in Figure C3, where the top panel shows the suitability of \nwine production in the US under present temperature conditions, and the bottom panel shows the \nsuitability under anticipated future changes in temperature. Under the latter, the scope for high \nquality  winegrape  production  is  dramatically  reduced.  This  reduction  is  driven  primarily  by \nchanges  in  the  temperature  extremes,  with  changes  in  mean  temperature  GDD  causing  little \nchange in production (White et al., 2006). \n \nAgricultural Pests \nMany of the most important agricultural pests are insects, along with many species that pollinate \ncrops, increase soil fertility through decomposition, and prey upon crop pests. Insect pests reduce \nUS crop production by 13% for an annual loss of $33 billion (USBC 1998). The increase in plant \nstress predicted with climate change will lead to reduced plant resistance to insect herbivores and \nan increase in loss. Because different aspects of the climate are not expected to shift in the same \nway (Williams et al. 2007), the impact on agriculture will not be easily forecast (Paine et al. \n1998). For example, increased CO2 levels can increase the losses of soybean to the invasive \nJapanese beetle (Hamilton et al. 2005). The large majority of our crop pest insects are invasive \nspecies. The exotic insects such as soybean aphid and the emerald ash borer that successfully \ninvade the Midwest are those that come from similar climates. An altered climate regime in \nIndiana  could  invite  an  entirely  new  suite  of  invasive  insects  that  we  currently  have  no \nknowledge of.   Forest insect pests, such as the gypsy moth, defoliate  trees during the early \nsummer.  When combined with the stress of drought, trees are known to die (Pijanowski 1994). \nWarmer  winter  temperatures  can  also  decrease  forest  pest  over-wintering  morality  in  turn \nincreasing the pest population levels during the summer (Sharov  et al. 1999). In Indiana, loss of \ntrees  on  private  forest  lands  could  have  a  large  economic  impact  as  these  lands  are  often \nharvested and income by families during important times. \n \nWe  have  quantified  the  potential \nimpacts of future climate change on \na  suite  of  Indiana  corn  pests  (see \nFigure  C4).  We  find  that  the \ndistribution of these pests expands \nin  Indiana  for  those  pests  that  are \nnot  already  prevalent  throughout \nIndiana. In particular, the migratory \ntaxa  \u2013  armyworm  and  corn \nearworm  \u2013  become  substantially \nmore  prevalent  in  the  future \nclimate, transitioning from rarely or \nnever present to commonly present. \nThis  expansion  is  driven  by \ndecreases  in  the  occurrence  of \nsevere  cold  events,  allowing  these \ntaxa to overwinter in Indiana. These \nmigratory  taxa  happen  to  be  the \nmost  cosmopolitan  in  their \ninfestations, raising the possibility that the risk of infestation would likely increase for other \ncrops in addition to corn should greenhouse gas concentrations continue to rise.   15 \n \nD. Likely Impacts of Climate Change on Plants and Animals in Indiana \nJeff Holland, Dept, of Entomology; Rueben Goforth, Dept. of Forestry and Natural Resources; \nMarisol Sepulveda, Dept. of Forestry and Natural Resources; Kevin Gibson, Dept. of Botany \nand Plant Pathology; Harmon Weeks, Dept. of Forestry and Natural Resources; Charles \nMichler,  Dept. of Forestry and Natural Resources and the USDA Forest Service; Hardwood \nTree Improvement and Regeneration Center; John \u201cBarny\u201d Dunning, Dept. of Forestry and \nNatural Resources; Rod Williams, Dept. of Forestry and Natural Resources; Kerry Rabenold, \nDept. of Biological Sciences; Bryan Pijanowski, Dept. of Forestry and Natural Resources; Helen \nRowe, Restoration Ecology Initiative, Purdue Center for the Environment; Patrick A. Zollner \nDepartment of Forestry and Natural Resources \n \nPlants  and  animals  are  particularly  sensitive  to  climate  variability  and  there  are  potentially \nseveral important species that could be impacted by future climate change in Indiana.  In general, \nthreats from climate change are likely to be manifested by declines or changes in behavior of \nnative species, increased incidence of invasive species and/or increased risks of extinction of \nendangered/threatened species.   Research on this topic (impacts of climate change on plant and \nespecially animal distributions in Indiana or the Great Lakes in general) is sparse.  Potential \nclimate change impacts in Indiana by major taxonomic group are as follows: \n \nInsects \nThe possible affects of climate change on agricultural pests are addressed in the Agriculture \nsection of this analysis. \n \nAn altered climate could also hamper efforts to bolster populations of endangered insects such as \nKarner\u2019s blue butterfly and Mitchell\u2019s satyr butterfly.  Efforts to reintroduce species such as \nHine\u2019s  emerald  dragonfly  and  the  American  burying  beetle  could  also  be  frustrated.    Many \nadditional  insect  species  could  face  extinction  under  an  altered  climate  if  the  necessary \ntemperature conditions and necessary moisture conditions become separated in space (i.e., a no \nanalogue future).  Insect species are especially reliant on specific host plants, environmental \nconditions, and microclimates.  If these necessary conditions shift locations, the species must be \nable to move across the Indiana landscape to track these conditions.  Understanding how human \nland use impedes or facilitates the movement of beneficial or endangered insects will become \nincreasingly important to avoid \u201cfiltering out\u201d these species during such migrations. \n \nMany insects cause disease in humans and pets.  Warmer winters are normally associated with \nincreases in the ability of pest species such as ticks to overwinter, and therefore milder winters \nmay lead to an increase in tick-borne diseases such as Lyme disease. \n \nMussels \nMussels in Indiana streams serve critical ecological roles as primary consumers, filter feeders, \nand  detritivores,  and  they  provide  significant  ecosystem  services  by  acting  as  nutrient  sinks \n(McMahon 1991).  However, they are very susceptible to mortality as a result of increased water \ntemperature regimes, decreased oxygen levels, lowered minimum flows, and large flood events, \nall of which are likely consequences of climate change (Gibson et al. 2005).  Freshwater mussels \nare already among the most imperiled aquatic organisms worldwide (Bogan 1993, Williams et al.   16 \n1993), and of the 67 mussel species in Indiana, 10 are Federally-listed as endangered species.  \nStream and river environmental changes related to climate change will undoubtedly hasten the \nextirpation of Indiana\u2019s mussels from the State\u2019s waters, thus contributing to a significant loss of \nboth natural history and ecological integrity. \n \nFish \nImmediate effects of global warming are likely to be felt most dramatically by cool and cold-\nwater species.  Indeed cold-water species, such as lake trout and brown trout, and even some \ncool-water fish, such as northern pike and walleye, may decline dramatically, potentially to the \npoint where they disappear from the southern parts of the state.  There is also concern about \neffects on the overall change in distribution of warm-water species.   For example, the range of \nwarm-water fish species, such as smallmouth bass and bluegill, is likely to expand northward.  In \naddition, increases in water temperatures are likely to increase the spread of several pathogens \nand thus increase the incidence of fish die-offs, especially during the summer months. \n \nAmphibians \nIn  extreme  years  reduced  pond  depth  can  increase  exposure  of  amphibian  embryos  to  UVB \nradiation.   In controlled laboratory studies (Blaustein et al.), exposure to UVB radiation caused a \n90%  increase  in  mortality  of  embryos.    In  other  studies,  increase  UVB  exposure  causes  an \nincrease to infectious diseases which in turn increases mortality (Kiesecker et al. 2001).   In \naddition,  warming  of  climate  would  increase  surface  water  body  temperatures  thus  altering \nimportant habitat for amphibians, especially those dependent on wetlands. One critical resource \nin Indiana is vernal pools in woodlands, which support breeding populations of many forest \namphibians. These populations may disappear if vernal pools dry earlier, preventing amphibians \nfrom  completing  their  aquatic  life  stage.  The  state-listed  crawfish  frog  and  the  four-toed \nsalamander are endangered species that could be adversely impacted by climate change. \n \nReptiles \nWe  know  that  many  species  of  turtles,  including  those  endemic  to  Indiana,  have  TSD \n(temperature-dependent sex determination).  For example, eggs laid in soils that are kept cold \nproduce males whereas warmer soils produce females.  In Indiana, the Spotted Turtle, Ornate \nBox  Turtle  and  Blanding\u2019s  Turtle,  have  TSD  (temperature-dependent  sex  determination).   \nJanzen (1994) stated that an increase of 4C would effectively eliminate the production of male \noffspring. \n \nBirds \nImpacts of climate change on bird populations are likely to include changes in abundance and \ndistribution of some species, especially those whose northern or southern geographical limits \noccur in Indiana.  Southern species like black vultures are likely to spread northward through the \nstate, as northern species such as rose-breasted grosbeaks and veerys are likely to contract to the \nnorth, in part because plant communities that they inhabit will shift northward.  More severe \nweather  events,  especially  in  winter,  will  create  unpredictable  pressures  on  rare  species  and \nspecies at their northern limits, like Carolina wrens.  More species are likely to attempt to over-\nwinter  in  Indiana  habitats,  changing  the  balance  of  competition  for  winter  food;  in  the \nsoutheastern states, changes in wintering geese distribution is a leading cause of ecosystem stress \non both the winter and breeding grounds.     17 \nImplications of the reshuffling of species in natural ecosystems are difficult to predict, but some \nstudies have shown decoupling of important plant-pollinator and seed-dispersal relationships, \nand exotic species could benefit.  Migratory birds driven by photoperiod are likely to arrive and \nattempt to breed at times of reduced food abundance since local plant productivity and prey are \nmore attuned to temperature regimes that are shifting with respect to the calendar and likely to \noccur earlier compared to the birds' arrival.  One possible impact is early leafout of Indiana\u2019s \nforests prior to the normal arrival of migratory species, leading to less effective predation by \nbirds on forest insect pests.   \n \nThe impacts of West Nile virus on bird populations are well documented, especially on crows \nand  relatives  (LaDeau  et  al.  2007),  and  presents  a  likely  harbinger  of  future  invasions  of \npathogens and disease vectors.  The ability of bird populations to adapt to changing biological \ninteractions will likely be slow in comparison with the rate of change in species\u2019 abundances.  \nState threatened species, such as breeding populations of Sandhill cranes and upland sandpipers, \nin addition to Federally endangered species such as the piping plover, are likely to lose their \nalready tenuous foothold in Indiana.   \n \nSummer drought and early spring runoff will contribute to the already extensive loss of Indiana \nwetlands, which provide habitat for migratory shorebirds and waterfowl, and 16 of 36 state-listed \nspecies of breeding birds.  Wetland-associated birds provided a large portion of the outdoor \nrecreation  industry,  including  both  hunting  (estimated  at  $2.3  billion  nationally)  and  bird \nwatching  (estimated  at  $32  billion  nationally).    Twenty-nine  percent  of  Hoosiers  identify \nthemselves as bird watchers, placing Indiana 15\nth among the states in proportion of residents \nincluding themselves in this activity (La Rouce 2003). \n \nMammals \nMammals in Indiana play a critical role in many ecosystem functions.  Mammals influence forest \nregeneration and succession patterns both as primary dispersers for natural regeneration of tree \nspecies like oaks and also as herbivores altering recruitment patterns for tree seedlings as well as \nother native forest understory vegetation.  It is unclear how quickly climate change patterns may \nalter the community dynamics of forest understory plants but it is safe to assume that the speed \nand magnitude of perturbations to those processes will be influenced by interactions with white-\ntailed deer whose densities have been demonstrated to profoundly impact ecological succession \nin Indiana\u2019s state parks (Webster et. al. 2001).  Mammal species also contribute greatly to pest \nmanagement in Indiana\u2019s agricultural fields (e.g. over a typical summer a colony of 150 big \nbrown bats consume enough beetles to  preclude the production of 33 million root worm larvae \nthat feed on corn; Whitaker 1995).   Changing cropping patterns in response to climate change \nmay have unforeseen interactions with changing habitat availability for such wildlife species that \nperform economically valuable pest management functions.  Shifting habitat availability related \nto  climate  change  and  associated  alterations  in  human  land  use  patterns  will  change  the \ndistribution  of  many  mammalian  species  throughout  the  state  of  Indiana  because  these  wild \nmammals depend upon vegetation that will be altered by climate change (Swihart et al. 1994).  \nSuch shifts in areas of activity may increase the rate of contact between species like raccoons and \ncrops  leading  to  increased  economic  losses  through  crop  depredation.    The  potential \nconcentration of wildlife species in closer proximity to humans and areas where humans are \nmore active may also increase the risks of disease transmission to humans as well as livestock.     18 \n \n \nFigure D1. Current and historic locations of swamp rabbits in \nIndiana. \n \nOther mammal species are valued \nby the citizens of Indiana for their \nunique  characteristics  and  rarity \nin the state and the likely impacts \nof  climate  change  upon  these \nmammals  are  not  simple  to \npredict.  An excellent example is \nthe  swamp  rabbit  which  is \nIndiana\u2019s  rarest  mammal.    A \nrecent survey (Roy-Nielson et al. \n2007) estimates that there are only \n40  individual  swamp  rabbits \npresent  in  the  state  of  Indiana.  \nSwamp rabbits are a highly prized \ngame  species  in  several \nneighboring states (Kentucky and \nIllinois) and climate change could \nlead  to  more  habitat  for  swamp \nrabbits  in  southern  Indiana.  \nHowever  warming  temperatures \nassociated  with  climate  change \nmay not be sufficient to enhance \nopportunities for the state\u2019s most \nendangered  mammal  because \nthroughout  their  range  swamp \nrabbits  are  associated  with \nbottomland  hardwood  forest \nhabitat types (Zollner et al. 2000) \nand land use practices in southern \nIndiana  may  preclude  the \nexpansion  of  these  forest  types  even  if  climate  change  creates  more  opportunity  for  their \ncreation.    Thus  we  are  left  with  a  critical  gap  in  our  knowledge  of  swamp  rabbit  habitat \nrequirements at the northern limits of the species range where climate change may present us \nwith a chance to enhance the numbers of the state\u2019s most endangered mammal.  More broadly, \nclimate change will cause distributional shifts in the range of many threatened and endangered \nmammalian species and there is a real need to understand how human land uses may create \nbarriers (e.g. highways) that populations of these valued wildlife species will not be able to cross \nwithout  some  human  intervention  such  as  mitigating  structures  in  road  designs.    So  climate \nchanges  necessitates  a  better  understanding  of  how  human  land  use  patterns  alter  the \nconnectivity of Indiana\u2019s landscape for mammalian wildlife species with a wide range of life \nhistory characteristics (e.g. varying degrees of vagility). \n \nTrees \nAn extensive analysis has been performed of tree species richness and forest types under five \ndifferent climate change scenarios (Iverson and Prasad, 2001). In Indiana, all models predict a   19 \ndramatic reduction in forests that contain Black walnut, black cherry, maple and beech.  All \nmodels predict a reduction of > 500 km2 in the Eastern US, with much of that reduction in states \nincluding and surrounding Indiana.  Part of this shift will move to oak forest types, but it is worth \nnoting that much of this shift will not occur to high value commercial species.  Thus if these \nclimate change models are accurate, the Indiana forest products industry might incur additional \ntransportation costs, be forced to offer different product lines with lower value hardwoods, or \nshift to areas where the economics are more favorable. \n \nGrasses, Weeds and Native Plants \nIf future conditions point toward a warming trend, it is anticipated that many invasive exotic \nplant  species  might  move  northward  in/into  Indiana.  These  would  include Ailanthus,  kudzu, \noriental  bittersweet  (although  it  already  occurs  commonly  in  the  Dunes),  privet,  Wisteria, \nPaulownia,  and  Japanese  stilt-grass.  What  impact  such  a  trend  might  have  on  existing \nproblematic exotics like Amur honeysuckle and garlic mustard is hard to predict, but since they \nseem to thrive in the northern part of the state and the Upper Midwest in general, increasing \ntemperatures may work against these species. \n \nIf  futures  contain  more  extreme  weather  events,  such  as  deepening/more  extended  drought, \nwould  certainly  impact  forest  and  grassland  systems,  perhaps  favoring  oak  in  some  areas \n(possibly beneficial); in grasslands  and prairie  restorations, increased temperatures and more \nsporadic  moisture  may  actually  favor  established  prairie  restoration  areas  (because  of  their \ndrought tolerance compared to competitors), but will make establishment much more difficult \nand unpredictable. \n \nTallgrass  prairies  in  Indiana  are  comprised  of  mixed  C-3,  C-4  plant  communities.    Climate \nchange  may  alter  the  current  balance  of  these  species  in  two  ways.    C-3  plants  have  been \npredicted to increase with elevated CO2 concentrations because they are CO2 limited compared \nwith  C-4  plants  whose  photosynthetic  pathway  concentrates  CO2.    However,  two  grassland \nstudies have shown that warming and elevated CO2 can lead declines in C-3 plants, including \ninvasive plant species compared to C-4 plants (Owensby et al. 1999, Ziska et al. 2004, Williams \net al. 2007).  Climate change has also been shown to reduce plant available nitrogen through \nelevated CO2 (Williams et al. 2001, Zhang et al. 2005).  C-4 plants have a higher nutrient use \nefficiencies than C-3 grasses, and reduced nitrogen availability has been shown to benefit C-4 \nplants over C-3 plants in tallgrass prairie (Bleier & Jackson 2007).  Changes that increase the \ndominance of C-4 plant species would change the plant community structure and may change \necosystem function, such as nutrient cycling, and have specific consequences for wildlife habitat \n(nutritional quality of forage and habitat requirements). On the other hand, in cases where C-3 \nplants are non-native invasive species, this trend could benefit tallgrass prairie management and \nrestoration.  Caution should be taken, however, because photosynthetic pathways may not be \ndefinitive predictors of competitive outcomes (Dukes 2007). \n \nWeeds are a major pest in agricultural and less intensively managed systems and billions of \ndollars are spent annually in the United States on weed management.  Yield losses due to weeds \nresult in additional billions lost, primarily to growers.  Climate change will likely have four \nmajor impacts on weeds and weed management.  First, land managers (growers, homeowners, \nnatural resource managers) in Indiana may face new weed species as species currently limited to   20 \nsouthern U.S. migrate into the state.  For example, kudzu is currently present on limited acreage \nin  Indiana;  warming  temperatures  might  increase  its  distribution  to  the  detriment  of  Indiana \nforests.  Northerly shifts in the geographical range of some of our current weeds might offset the \narrival  of  new  species.    However,  at  a  minimum,  land  managers  will  have  to  develop  new \nstrategies to respond to changes in our weed communities.  Second, climate change may increase \ncompetitiveness  of  some  weeds,  particularly  C4  species  which  maximize  growth  at  higher \ntemperatures than C3 species like soybeans (Tungate et al. 2007).  Third, climate change may \nfurther weaken plant communities damaged by current invaders, i.e. emerald ashborer, limiting \nthe ability of natural communities to resist invasion.  Weeds are opportunistic species that readily \ninvade disturbed areas.  More extreme weather events, extended drought, canopy gaps opened as \nmesic forests transition to more xeric species or to grasslands may increase the availability of \ndisturbed  habitat  that  can  be  colonized.  Finally,  current  management  practices  may  be  less \neffective under current climate change scenarios forcing growers to adopt more costly and/or less \nenvironmentally  benign  practices.  For  example,  changes  in  soil  temperature  and  in  weed \nmorphology, physiology, and phenology may affect herbicide efficacy, in some cases requiring \nhigher application rates (Patterson 1995; Bailey 2004; Ziska et al. 2004; Ziska and Goins 2006).     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   21 \nE.  Likely Impacts of Climate Change on the Soils of Indiana \nCliff T. Johnston, Dept. of Agronomy \n \nThe soils of Indiana are one its major natural resources.  A disproportionately large fraction of \nour  total  economy  is  based  on  the  health  and  quality  of  our  soils.    All  aspects  of  Indiana \nagriculture are critically linked to the soil.  In addition, we use soils to support the buildings we \nlive and work in, and the roads we drive on, and to accept and purify many our waste products.  \nSoil functions as a living filter where all of the water in our aquifers passes through the soils and \nall runoff entering our streams and lakes flows over and is impacted by soils.   \n \nWithin the soil, the stabilization of carbon in the form of soil organic matter is essential in \nmaintaining the productivity and sustainability of agricultural land.  Loss of soil organic matter is \npositively correlated with increased soil loss, loss of soil structure, and an overall decrease in the \nsoil\u2019s ability to retain moisture and essential nutrients for plant growth.    \n \nBased  on  projected  increases  in  temperature  and  overall  length  of  the  growing  season, \nagricultural productivity and crop growth would increase.  Provided that a sufficient amount of \ncrop residue is returned to the soil, soil organic matter would be preserved.  However, \u2018hotter, \ndrier summers\u2019 would lead to an overall loss of soil organic matter resulting from increased soil \nrespiration, the biological breakdown of plant and animal residues in the soil into CO2.  This \ncombined with initiatives to capture more carbon from crops through cellulosic conversion of \ncorn stover to ethanol would negatively impact soil carbon.  These impacts will require new \ninitiatives/strategies to maintain and preserve soil organic matter. \n \nAlthough cultivated organic soils do not represent a large fraction of agricultural landscape (1.5 \n%), these soils are a dominant source term of carbon emissions.  Based on a collaborative effort \nbetween the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service and Colorado State University in \n\u201cThe Indiana Carbon Storage Project\u201d, greenhouse gas emission were modeled for Indiana based \non  the  Century  Model  (Smith  et  al.,  2002).    Based  on  the  data  for  1999,  our  agricultural \nlandscape  consisted  of  12.6  million  acres  in  cropland,  0.6  million  acres  in  CRP/Grass \nconservation, 0.06in tree/wetland conservation, and 0.2 million acres of cultivated organic soils.   \nBased on the model parameters, a total of 1.3 million tons of carbon were sequestered in 12.7 \nmillion acres of cropland, or 0.1 ton of carbon stored/(acre-year).  However, a total of 750,000 \ntons of carbon was lost from cultivated organic soils which represent only a small fraction of our \nagricultural landscape (1.5%).  On a per acre basis, this corresponds to 3 tons of C lost/(acre-\nyear).   Thus, approximately half of the carbon being stored in 12.7 million acres is lost from \n213,000 acres of cultivated organic soils.  The loss of carbon from this small fraction of our \nagricultural landscape resulted from draining and cultivation of these soils.   Exposure of these \norganic  soils  to  oxygen  (drainage  and  continued  cultivation)  and  increased  temperature  will \nincrease the loss of soil organic matter.  In other words, taking these soils out of production and \npreserving their soil organic matter would not significantly impact Indiana agriculture.  Policy \nchanges to provide a mechanism where these soils are not drained and taken out of cultivation \ncould significantly increase the overall amount of carbon being stored in Indiana soils.   \n   22 \n \nFigure F1.

Possible Impacts of Climate Change on Indiana Human Health \nNoah Diffenbaugh, Dept. of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences; Paul Shepson, Dept. of Earth and \nAtmospheric Sciences and Dept. of Chemistry \n \nHeat- and Cold-Related Health Effects \nHeat stress poses a substantial threat to human health, particularly to those individuals that are \nalready infirm (Rothfusz 1990, Changnon et al. 1996, Poumadere et al. 2005). The effects of heat \nstress are most pronounced when exposure lasts for extended periods (e.g., (Poumadere et al. \n2005)). The occurrence of extremely hot days is likely to increase in Indiana if greenhouse gas \nconcentrations continue to rise unabated (e.g., (Meehl & Tebaldi 2004, Diffenbaugh et al. 2005) \nand figure above). Increases in the occurrence of extreme hot events \u2013 including more protracted \nperiods of severe heat \u2013 would likely increase the risk of heat-related morbidity and mortality. \n \nAt present, weather-related winter mortality is greater than weather-related summer mortality \n(Kalkstein & Greene 1997). The frequency and magnitude of extreme cold events in Indiana is \nlikely to be substantially reduced if greenhouse gas concentrations continue to rise unabated \n((Diffenbaugh  et  al.  2005),  and  figure  above).  However,  because  winter  weather-related \nmortality is less sensitive to changes in temperature, attempts to quantify future changes in heat- \nand cold-related mortality indicate that increases in summer mortality will outweigh decreases in \nwinter mortality (Kalkstein & Greene 1997). \n \nPollution-Related Health Effects \nAir pollution illnesses of most concern/impact \nrelate to ozone and particulate matter, both of \nwhich  are  regulated  by  the  Clean  Air  Act \n(CAA).  Interestingly, they are not emitted, but \nproduced  in  the  atmosphere  from  precursors \nthat  are  emitted.  Indiana  occasionally  violates \nthe  CAA  standards,  most  often  in  the \nIndianapolis  area  and  northwest  corner  of  the \nstate. \n \nMeteorological conditions can support or inhibit \nthe health risks of atmospheric constituents such \nas  ozone  and  particulates.  Thus,  changes  in \nthose  meteorological  conditions  induced  by \nglobal  warming  could  enhance  or  reduce  the \nrisk  of  atmospheric  health  risks.  Of  particular \nconcern  is  the  occurrence  stagnant  high-\npressure air masses, as atmospheric stagnation \ncan result in protracted exposure to pollutants, \nand exacerbates the development of photochemical smog events. Thus, we have calculated the \noccurrence of air stagnation conditions in the present and projected future climates. We find that \nelevated  greenhouse  gas concentrations induce  changes in regional weather that increase the \noccurrence  of  stagnation  events  over  Indiana  up  to  30%  (see  Figure  F1).  Increases  in  air \nstagnation events could increase the risk of pollution-related illness.   23 \n \nHowever, future changes in pollution-related morbidity and morality will be dictated not only by \nchanges  in  meteorological  conditions,  but  also  by  changes  in  pollution  emissions  and \natmospheric chemistry. This is borne out by several recent coupled climate-chemistry models \n(Tagaris et al., 2007; Wu et al., 2008).  The Tagaris et al. (2007) study indicates that for the \nmidwest, changes in emissions will have a significantly greater impact on ozone and particulate \nmatter  than  will  the  climate  change  impact.    While  climate  change  impacts  will  increase \nsummertime average ground level ozone by only 1-3 ppb (or about 2-6% in summer; Wu et al., \n2008),  there  will  be  a  greater  incidence  of  smog  episodes.    In  other  words,  climate  change \nincreases the frequency of pollution events that impact human health, in part due to incidences of \nstagnation events.  \n \nPerhaps most significantly, Wu et al. (2008) discuss the \u201cclimate change penalty\u201d related to \nmanagement of ground level ozone; this penalty for Indiana is only a few ppb, on average.  But \nclimate change increases the frequency of events, and the events are what matter in terms of \nhuman health and the CAA regulations.  Thus, in tangible terms, it will take a further reduction \nof NOx emissions (from combustion sources) of ~25% in 2050, to meet the same CAA standard, \ndue to the \u201cclimate change penalty\u201d. \n \nImpacts on particulate matter are less well understood.  For Indiana in summer time, much of the \nfine particulate matter (\u201cPM2.5\u201d) is derived from SO2 emitted from coal-fired power plants.  \nThus it is likely that particulate matter in the future will be most sensitive to changes in the base \nelectric power load, and how that load is managed.  We note, however, that that is sensitive to \nclimate change, and to summer time stagnation events.  In  Indiana in summer, a significant \nfraction of particulate matter derives from volatile organic compounds (VOCs), much of which is \nemitted  by  vegetation.    These  emissions  increase  exponentially  with  increasing  temperature.  \nSecondary organic aerosol (\u201cSOA\u201d) derived from VOCs can be important in Indiana, especially \nwhen the wind direction is from forested regions to the south and southwest.  This is an area of \nintensive research, as it is not very well understood (Liao et al., 2007; Dawson et al., 2007). \n \nInfectious Diseases \nThe  potential  effect  of  future  climate  change  on  infectious  diseases  in  Indiana  is  a  topic  of \ncurrent  research,  including  at  Purdue  University.  Of  particular  interest  is  the  possible \nintroduction  of  exotic  vector-borne  diseases.  Temperature  is  likely  to  influence  vector-borne \nviruses in at least three ways. First, warmer temperatures can increase viral replication, which \ncould  increase  disease  prevalence  (Kilpatrick,  Diffenbaugh,  et  al.  in  prep).  Second,  cold \ntemperatures can control the length of the viral transmission season (Kilpatrick, Diffenbaugh, et \nal. in prep), meaning that decreases in severe cold events could increase disease prevalence. \nThird, high temperatures can decrease mosquito survivorship (Kilpatrick, Diffenbaugh, et al. in \nprep), meaning that projected increases in the occurrence of extreme hot events could decrease \ndisease prevalence. How these three influences will interact in a substantially warmer climate is \ncurrently unknown. Further, how changes in vector ecology will affect disease transmission is \nalso unkown. In particular, humidity and precipitation been shown to influence vector ecology \n(Shaman et al. 2002). This influence indicates that changes in the hydrologic cycle could also \ninfluence vector-borne disease prevalence in Indiana, although whether those hydrologic changes \nwill enhance or inhibit disease prevalence remains uncertain.   24 \n \n \nFigure G1.

Possible  Impacts  of  Climate  Change  on  Indiana  Heating  and \nCooling Demand \nNoah Diffenbaugh, Dept. of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences; Kevin Gurney, Dept. of Earth and \nAtmospheric Sciences and Dept. of Agronomy \n \nAs  a  first  approximation,  warmer  conditions  are  likely  to  increase  demand  for  cooling  and \nincrease demand for heating. One source of uncertainty is where in the United States increased \ncooling demand will dominate, and where decreased heating demand will dominate. We have \ncalculated total meteorological heating and cooling demand for the United States, using the base \n65 \u02daF method used by NOAA, and scaling for population density. In Indiana, heating demand \ndecreases by up to -1000 degree days, while cooling demand increases by up to 700 degree days \n(see figure below). Total demand decreases throughout Indiana in the future climate, with peak \ndecreases of 500 degree days occurring in northeast Indiana (see Figure G1).  \n \nIt is important to consider that a different mixes of fuels and energy generation technology are \nused for heating and cooling. Thus, quantification of how these changes in demand will influence \nactual energy usage and emissions requires further analysis. \n \n \n   25 \n \n \nFigure H1.

Carbon management opportunities and consequences \nKevin  Gurney,  Dept.  of  Earth  and  Atmospheric  Sciences  and  Dept.  of  Agronomy;  Qianlai \nZhuang, Dept. of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences and Dept. of Agronomy; Noah Diffenbaugh, \nDept. of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences \n \nInventory/Registry \nThe Lieberman-Warner bill discusses a greenhouse gas registry system that will be constructed \nby the EPA Administrator to assist in quantifying baselines of emissions and progress toward the \nemission reduction goals described in the bill (Title I, subtitle A). Relevant to this proposal is \ncurrent research underway at Purdue University in the state of Indiana. Funded by a combination \nof  NASA  and  DOE,  a  comprehensive  US  inventory  of  fossil  fuel  carbon  dioxide  is  near \ncompletion and quantifies these emissions from every source in the United States at sub-county \nresolution every hour (see Figure H1).  \n \nThese  emissions  include  all  economic  sectors  and  quantifies  these  emissions  down  to  the \nindividual industrial facility and individual roadway. The importance of this work to the State of \nIndiana and the operationalization of the Lieberman-Warner bill may be worthy of consideration \nby the Indiana delegation (see Figure H2). This work should be highlighted and may save the \nEPA Administrator considerable effort and cost. At the least, this work should form a crucial \nelement of the Registry construction. \n \nAgriculture and Forestry Offsets \nThe Lieberman-Warner bill includes a fairly extensive mechanism of agriculture and forestry \nemissions  offsets  that  emitters  can  use  in  place  of,  or  as  an  amendment  to,  greenhouse  gas \nemission reductions (Title II, Subtitle D). This component of the Lieberman-Warner bill has   26 \nwide-ranging implications for the State of Indiana as there are a variety of offset opportunities in \nthe agriculture sector, some of which have already been practiced in the state. In addition to the \npotential to accrue offset credits, there are potentially negative implications to some of these \nactivities having to do with climate feedbacks and implications for other environmental attributes \nthat might be considered unintended consequences of offset activities.  \n \nThe best and probably most familiar technique available to the agricultural sector of Indiana to \naccrue offsets is through the use of reduced or no tillage agriculture, use of fallow periods, and \nconversion of marginal agricultural land to grassland or forest. Recent estimates indicate that the \nagricultural lands of the state are currently a net sink of atmospheric CO2 of roughly 0.8 million \ntons of carbon/year (estimate for the year 1999; Smith et al., 2002). Since more than one-half of \nIndiana\u2019s 5.1 million hectares of cropland are still managed using conventional tillage practices, \nconsiderable potential remains. It must be noted for context that this amount of sequestration \nconstitutes roughly 2% of Indiana\u2019s 1999 fossil fuel carbon emissions. \n \nSimilarly important for Indiana are offsets that accrue from manure management and disposal \nwhich include waste aeration and methane capture and combustion. Given the large amount of \nhog farming within the state, these mechanisms to lower the methane emissions could lead to \nsignificant offsets. \n \nThough small in overall state context, there are a few additional allowed offsets that are relevant \nto Indiana. These include afforestation, reforestation, and forest management practices. Though \nmuch  smaller  in  extent,  forest  lands  or  land  with  near-term  potential  for  afforestation  and \nreforestation, sequester much larger amounts of carbon per unit area than do agricultural lands.  \n \nThese practices also generate additional risks and benefits, depending upon extent, intensity and \ncriteria employed. Efforts at reforestation and afforestation often impart significant co-benefits \nsuch  as  improved  or  additional  habitat  for  wildlife,  soil  and  water  retention,  aesthetic \nimprovements,  and  microclimate  changes.  Certainly  practices  associated  with  carbon \nsequestration in cropland most directly influence soil organic matter, a considerable co-benefit of \nsequestration. \n \nFor Indiana, the likelihood that significant additional carbon sequestration in cropland will occur \nis  fundamentally  tied  to  the  opportunity  cost  of  cropland.  This  opportunity  cost  is  currently \nundergoing potential changes, driven in large measure, by the opportunity to grow corn for an \nemerging biofuel market. To the extent that co-benefits and risks are quantified in market terms, \nsequestration may or may not increase in competitive advantage with the cropland opportunity \ncost. \n \n \nPhysical Climate Changes \nIt is now well established that land cover influences surface climate, both through surface energy \nbalance and through biogeochemical cycles (Pielke et al. 2002). Changes in land cover resulting \nfrom  both  direct  human  modification  and  biogeographic  change  could  thus  have  substantial \nimpact  on  surface  climate  in  the  coming  decades  (Douville  et  al.  2000,  Levis  et  al.  2000, \nBergengren et al. 2001, Diffenbaugh 2005b, Diffenbaugh 2005a, Feddema et al. 2005). We have   27 \n \nFigure H3. Differences in summer temperature and \nprecipitation induced by cropping in Indiana (compared \nwith the pre-farming forested landscape).  Replacement of \ncurrent crops with carbon sequestration plantations could \nthus result in warmer, wetter conditions in Indiana.  From \nDiffenbaugh, in preparation. \nquantified  the  contribution  of  modern \nland  cover  to  surface  climate  in  the \nUnited  States.  In  Indiana,  the  modern \nland  cover  results  in  cooler,  drier \nconditions than would occur with the pre-\nfarming  land  cover  (see  Figure  H3). \nThese results indicate that replacement of \ncurrent  crops  with  carbon  sequestration \nplantations  could  thus  result  in  warmer, \nwetter conditions in Indiana.  \n \nAlthough  the  result  of  crop-induced \ncooling  is  consistent  with  most  other \nexperiments  in  the  peer-reviewed \nliterature  (e.g.,  (Bonan  1999)),  further \nexperiments  testing  the  effects  of  land \ncover  change  in  Indiana  alone  are \nrequired.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   28 \nI.

Global climate change has numerous implications for members of mountain communities who feel\nthe impacts in both physical and social dimensions. In the western Himalayas of India, a majority of residents\nmaintain a livelihood strategy that includes a combination of subsistence or small-scale agriculture, livestock\nrearing, seasonal or long-term migration, and localized natural resource extraction. While warming tempera-\ntures, irregular patterns of precipitation and snowmelt, and changing biological systems present challenges to\nthe viability of these traditional livelihood portfolios in general, we find that climate change is also undermining\nlocal communities\u2019 livelihood assets in gender-specific ways. In this paper, we present a case study from the\nNanda Devi Biosphere Reserve (Uttarakhand, India) that both outlines the implications of climate change for\nwomen farmers in the area and highlights the potential for ecotourism (as a form of livelihood diversification)\nto strengthen both key livelihood assets of women and local communities\u2019 adaptive capacity more broadly. The\npaper intentionally employs a categorical focus on women but also addresses issues of inter-group and gender\ndiversity. With this special issue in mind, suggestions for related research are proposed for consideration by\nclimate scientists and social systems and/or policy modelers seeking to support gender justice through socially\ntransformative perspectives and frameworks.\n1 Women, gender, and climate change\nIt is increasingly evident that women are at the cen-\nter of the climate change challenge. Women are\ndisproportionately affected by climate change im-\npacts, such as droughts, floods, and other extreme\nweather events, but they also have a critical role\nin combatting climate change (UNFCCC, \u201cGender\nand Climate Change\u201d homepage; UN, 2014a).\nIt is by now widely accepted that we need both adapta-\ntion and mitigation measures to deal with the environmen-\ntal changes already occurring and predicted to occur with\na steadily warming planet (e.g., fluctuation and distribu-\ntions of annual mean temperature and precipitation, glacial\nmelt, ocean acidification, sea level rise, storm surges, mon-\nsoon variations, ecological changes including biodiversity\nloss, among other direct effects). The 2009 Copenhagen Ac-\ncord has already acknowledged the dangers for global mean\ntemperature rise above 2 \u25e6C, noting the particularly urgent\nthreat for small island nations and coastal regions in terms\nof heightened vulnerability to both short- and long-term im-\npacts of sea-level rise (UN, 2009). Meanwhile, at the so-\ncalled third pole of the Earth, there is a growing realization\nthat environmental changes in the Himalayan mountains \u2013\nthe water tower of Asia \u2013 threaten to undermine the secu-\nrity and well-being of a South Asian population of at least\n1.6 billion people, including 40% of the world\u2019s poor (Rasul,\nPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.\n506 M. V. Ogra and R. Badola: Gender and climate change in the Indian Himalayas\n2014). Yet in spite of the 1979 passage of the United Nations\u2019\nConvention of Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination\nAgainst Women (CEDAW) and numerous declarations of the\ncritical and important roles for women in promoting envi-\nronmental sustainability (including by the Secretariat of the\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\n(UNFCCC), above), some development scholars and practi-\ntioners are still lamenting the gap between rhetoric and action\nin mainstreaming gender into climate change discussions,\npolicy negotiations, and adaptation and/or mitigation prac-\ntice. Four decades after the passage of CEDAW and nearly\n20 years after the formation of the UNFCCC for example,\nHemmati and Rohr observed that gender equality is \u201cfinally\nbeginning to be accepted as one of the core principles of mit-\nigating climate change and adapting to its impacts\u201d (2009:\n25).\nTwo special issues of the international journal Gender and\nDevelopment (in 2002 and 2009, respectively) have helped to\nprovide seminal reference points and analyses of the core is-\nsues, framing a rich discourse about gender and climate that\nincludes academic researchers, policymakers, donor agen-\ncies, governments, NGOs, and activists from civil society\n(Masika, 2002; Denton, 2002; Nelson et al., 2002; Dankel-\nman, 2002; Lambrou and Piana, 2006; Brody et al., 2008;\nTerry, 2009; Seager, 2009a; Sweetman, 2009; Enarson and\nChakraboti, 2009; Dankelman, 2010; Aguilar, 2010; Mac-\nGregor, 2010; Arora-Jonsson, 2011; Alston and Whitten-\nbury, 2012; Sultana, 2014; WHO, 2014). Contributions made\nthrough robust transnational activist networks such as Gen-\nderCC and the Gender and Disaster Network also inform de-\nbates about gender and climate change issues. Participants\nin such networks have helped to popularize the rallying call\nfor gender justice that activists made prominent in Bali at\nthe 2007 meeting of the Conference of Parties to the UN-\nFCCC (Terry, 2009). Together, this body of work demon-\nstrates that many of the indirect impacts of climate change\n\u2013 e.g., increased salinization of coastal agricultural fields due\nto storm surge and sea level rise, drying streams, inland water\nscarcity and drought associated with fluctuating extremes of\ntemperatures, disrupted growing seasons and poor harvests,\nand increased intensity of storms \u2013 pose critical risks for\npeople\u2019s lives and livelihoods, and in ways that affect dif-\nferent groups in different ways. It reveals a growing consen-\nsus around the belief that climate change not only promises\nto disproportionately negatively impact the world\u2019s poor, but\nthat it will likely \u201cmagnify existing patterns of inequality, in-\ncluding gender inequality\u201d (UNDP, 2014).\nClearly, the intersections of climate change impacts,\npoverty, and gender-based inequalities are complex and war-\nrant continued attention. As guests to ESD and participants\nin the transdisciplinary 2013 workshop \u201cAdaptation and Re-\nsilience in the Hindu-Kush-Himalayas\u201d (held at the Univer-\nsity of Hamburg, Germany), we seek to help readers better\nunderstand the links between these issues through a focus\non women\u2019s experiences with climate change at the Nanda\nDevi Biosphere Reserve (NDBR), Uttarakhand, India. In\ncontributing details from this part of the Himalayas to a\nbroader cross-cultural literature that documents local expe-\nriences with climate change, we also aim to complement the\nquantitative, model-based approaches presented elsewhere in\nthis special issue with perspectives from the ground. We hope\nthat such an approach will help to deepen other people\u2019s\nunderstandings of the lived experiences in remote mountain\ncommunities dealing with a rapidly changing physical envi-\nronment.\nThis paper is organized as follows: in the next section, we\npresent a conceptual framework for the paper that empha-\nsizes theories of differentiated vulnerability and relevance of\nthe Sustainable Livelihoods (SL) framework (DFID, 1999)\nfor analysis of adaptive capacity. We then discuss method-\nological issues, explaining our focus on women and outlin-\ning the physical and cultural context for the paper\u2019s central\ncase study. Through our case study, we document some of\nthe ways in which NDBR community members report cur-\nrently experiencing and responding to climate change, and\nsuggest how differentiated impacts can be viewed through\na gender lens. Applying the SL framework to the example\nof livelihood diversification through ecotourism around the\nNDBR, we find that a homestay-based model emerging in\nNDBR is creating conditions for participating women to feel\nin greater control of their incomes and to more broadly en-\ngage in community-level development issues, which in turn\ndelivers benefits for their larger communities. This part of our\nanalysis shows that while some of women\u2019s livelihood assets\nare being undermined by climate change, such experiments\nwith ecotourism are also strengthening assets in meaningful\nand specific ways. Our discussion emphasizes the types of\nassets that this model of ecotourism has enhanced for NDBR\nwomen, while at the same time explaining the benefits for\nthe larger community. Yet, we also suggest that because over-\nall household asset mix shapes livelihood outcomes, risks of\ncapture of benefits by economic elites is a key concern. Ul-\ntimately, we use the example of women\u2019s experiences with\necotourism to demonstrate the value of an assets-based ap-\nproach for improved understanding of gender-differentiated\naspects of climate change more broadly. We close the pa-\nper with examples of ways that climate adaptation practice\nand policy can move from gender-blind to socially trans-\nformative, gender justice approaches and pose related re-\nsearch ideas for consideration by climate science and adap-\ntation policy modelers, in particular. We also reflect on the\nmethodological contributions that social scientists are espe-\ncially well positioned to offer. Ultimately, we hold that exam-\ninations of gender-differentiated experiences related to cli-\nmate change are important not only for what they may reveal\nabout vulnerabilities and strengths, but that such examina-\ntions are also valuable in terms of illuminating the deeply\npersonal scales at which the impacts of climate change will\ncontinue to be experienced.\nEarth Syst.

Badola: Gender and climate change in the Indian Himalayas 507\n2 Conceptual framework: differentiated\nvulnerability, sustainable livelihoods, and\nadaptive capacity\nClimate change has important direct and indirect effects that\nare not always immediately evident. At every scale, both be-\ntween and within nations, social factors are critical in deter-\nmining sources of strength and vulnerability to the impacts of\nclimate change. Investigations of key relationships between\ndifferentiated vulnerability and risk in the context of natu-\nral disasters and catastrophic events offer important insights\nfor studies of climate change (Enarson and Morrow, 1998;\nPoumad\u00e9re et al., 2005; Neumayer and Pl\u00fcmper, 2007; Enar-\nson and Chakrabarti, 2009; Mearns and Norton, 2010; Dan-\nkleman, 2010; Huang et al., 2010; David and Enarson, 2012;\nSeager, 2012; Sultana, 2014; Alagan and Aladukwaka, 2014;\nGDN, 2014; see also Blaikie and Brookfield, 1987; Ives and\nMesserli, 1989; Wisner et al., 2004). Taken together, these\nanalyses of the loss of life, livelihood, and security associ-\nated with specific extreme weather events around the world\ndemonstrate a range of differentiated and distinct impacts,\nintersecting along multiple lines including gender, race, age,\nethnicity, class, and ability. This work demonstrates that most\noften, the factors contributing to vulnerability are interlinked\nand compound insecurity. In the Indian Himalayas, for exam-\nple, many of the victims of deadly flash floods in 2013 near\nKedarnath, Uttarakhand, were from a single village nearby,\nwhere \u2013 in a high-risk livelihood strategy employed by very\npoor mountain communities \u2013 a collective of men drawn\nfrom each household reportedly set out to collect medicinal\nforest products in the flood zone and never returned (field in-\nterview, May 2014; see also news reports by Pand, 2013, and\nGusain and Datt, 2013). In this case, the mens\u2019 poverty, eth-\nnicity, and gender conspired to create a heightened \u2013 and dis-\ncriminatory \u2013 vulnerability that is literally embodied by the\nvictims\u2019 social and economic status. Women\u2019s vulnerabilities\nare often also experienced through their physical bodies in\nsimilarly gender- and class-differentiated ways: for example,\nintensified exposure of poor or physically isolated women\nand girls to criminal predators (sexual and physical assault,\nrape, and human trafficking) has been documented cross-\nculturally in the immediate aftermath of disaster events such\nas hurricanes and floods (Enarson and Chakraboti, 2009;\nDavid and Enarson, 2012; Kapoor, 2011; Aguilar, 2010).\nBuilding on such insights from recent gender and disaster\nresearch (rapid-onset events), we can expect that slow-onset\nevents associated with global and regional climate change\nwill also yield differentiated impacts. But what such impacts\nare likely? And what enables or constrains people\u2019s capac-\nity to best cope with these changes? The ability to success-\nfully mitigate the impact of anticipated events or adapt to\nchange over the long term will clearly depend on the ability\nto overcome vulnerability, whether at individual or collective\nscales. Therefore, it will be essential to find ways to promote\nmeaningful and sustainable livelihoods for all \u2013 as well as to\npromote the economic security and political voice required\nto maintain the livelihood base. As this article demonstrates\nthrough its central case study, this is an especially salient is-\nsue for women who even between wealth and ethnic groups\nmeet livelihood challenges with different sets of resources\n(or, as we refer to them in the paper, livelihood assets) than\nthe men with whom they share households.\n2.1 Sustainable livelihoods and adaptive capacity\nBelow, we present ways in which the Sustainable Livelihood\n(SL) framework (DFID, 1999) offers a robust base around\nwhich to further a discussion of differentiated vulnerabili-\nties, adaptation and adaptive capacity, and mitigation of the\nlivelihood-related impact of climate change. As shown in\nFig. 1 and discussed further below, the SL framework is de-\nsigned to offer \u201ca way of thinking about livelihoods that helps\norder complexity and makes clear the many factors that affect\nlivelihoods\u201d (DFID 1999: 2). Application of the SL frame-\nwork enables an examination of how different groups of peo-\nple manage and combine varying livelihood assets available\nto them, and illustrates the varying influences of the institu-\ntions, policies and structures existing around them. Recog-\nnizing that the component parts of any cultural\u2013economic\nsystem are never fixed in time or space, we find that the\nframework is best viewed as a conceptual model, represen-\ntational of and adaptable to mutable local contexts.\nIn mountain regions such as those found in the Indian\nHimalaya, where local livelihoods are highly vulnerable to\nfailure due to the ecological shocks and uncertainties asso-\nciated with climate change, adaptation must be considered\nto be a fundamental response option. An adaptation-based\napproach aims at moderating the adverse effects of climate\nchange through a wide variety of actions and adjustments in\necological, social, or economic systems and seeks to create\nbenefits from opportunities associated with climate change\n(Fussel and Klein, 2006; Ellis 2000). An optimistic perspec-\ntive suggests that one opportunity presents itself in the form\nof increased intensity of attention about the seriousness of the\nissue and potential flow of supporting resources to the region\n(i.e., as part of adaptation and mitigation response by the in-\nternational community and the Indian government). Because\nadaptation has multiple and interlinked dimensions, adaptive\ncapacity of local communities is governed both by internal,\nculturally specific characteristics as well as by larger exter-\nnal social, economic, and political structures that empower\nor constrain action. In our view, capacity building in adapta-\ntion is also predicated on the privilege of choice: a commu-\nnity, household, or person who lacks choice or alternatives\nin any situation has no real power. Thus, strengthening the\nadaptive capacity at any scale by expanding the range of re-\nsponse options is central to the challenge of addressing local\nvulnerabilities to the impacts of climate change, and to the\ngoal of empowering people to be able to make meaningful\nand viable choices about adaptation itself.\nwww.earth-syst-dynam.net/6/505/2015/ Earth Syst.

(b) Illustration of assets balance for poor vs. nonpoor households as suggested by FAO (2005), where assets above are shown\nin reference to enabling and/or disenabling transformative structures and processes (policies, institutions, and processes).\nOne important way to increase adaptive capacity is to sup-\nport initiatives which strengthen people\u2019s combined set of\nlivelihood capital assets (i.e., the arrangements of natural, fi-\nnancial, physical, human, and social forms of capital illus-\ntrated in Fig. 1). While the mainstream climate change dis-\ncourse gives much attention to macro-scale, transformative\nstructures and processes (international carbon markets, green\nenergy infrastructure, expansion of hydropower grid, etc.),\nattention also needs to be paid in understanding the micro-\nscale factors that determine the lived experience of climate\nchange. Asset analysis, in particular, needs to be achieved\nthrough the lens of differentiation in order to achieve a finer-\nscale understanding of threats and opportunities (see Fig. 1b\nwhich highlights the assets profile for generalized poor ver-\nsus non-poor households). As suggested in Table 1, which\nprovides examples of the five categories of livelihood as-\nsets with special reference to women\u2019s position in the In-\ndian Himalayas, a gendered perspective on assets adds value\neven in the context of less well documented intra-group dif-\nferences within economic or cultural groups. Worldwide,\nmany women live under conditions of exclusion or vulner-\nability strictly because of their gender, with limited access\nto key assets such as land and other productive resources,\nknowledge, technology, power, decision-making, education,\nhealthcare, and food (Aguilar, 2010). A baseline understand-\ning of gender-differentiated livelihoods assets is therefore es-\nsential to planning for adaptation, even in seemingly homo-\ngeneous communities. When adaptive capacity is understood\nin the context of mapped assets from this perspective, we be-\nlieve that a more holistic approach to planning can follow.\nEarth Syst.

Where cash is involved, men make the\ndecisions.\na In 2001 all-India sex ratio (F /M) for children = 927/1000 and for adults (F /M) 933 / 1000. In 2001 Uttarakhand sex ratio (F /M) for\nchildren = 908/1000 for adults 962 / 1000 (GOI, 2002). In 2011, the all-India sex ratio (F /M) = 919 / 1000 for children and 943 / 1000 for adult. In 2011,\nUttarakhand sex ratio (F /M)= livelihood diversification 890 / 1000 for children; 963 / 1000 for adult (GOI 2011). In Chamoli district, our field data\nindicate a decrease in child sex ratio (F /M) from 935 / 1000 in 2001 to 889 / 1000 in 2011.\nb In 2011, the all-India literacy rate = 65.46 % (female) and 82.14 % (male). In 2011, Uttarakhand literacy rate = 70.01 % (female) and 87.4 % (male) (GOI,\n2011). In Chamoli district, our field surveys suggest 2011 literacy rates of 72.32 % female and 93.4 % male.\nc In 2011, female agricultural workforce was 70 %, yet only 9.5 % own land (FAO data cited in Kapoor 2011).\nThe extent to which ecosystems and communities are vul-\nnerable or resilient depends both on exposure to changes\nin climate and physical changes as well as on the ability\nof the impacted social system to adapt. In applying the SL\nframework to rural communities at risk of livelihood fail-\nure in a more general sense (i.e., not solely related to cli-\nmate change), we consider three broad clusters of livelihood\nstrategies for the rural communities that have already been\nidentified and can be applied in context of the Indian Hi-\nmalayas. These are agricultural intensification and/or exten-\nsification, migration, and livelihood diversification (Scoones,\n1998). Given existing livelihood challenges related to larger\npatterns of rural poverty and the regional physical geogra-\nphy (e.g., steep slopes, flash flooding, landslides), agricul-\ntural expansion is not a viable long-term solution for most\nrural households. Agricultural intensification is already in\nplace where households have sufficiently strong assets. Mi-\ngration, similarly, is a strategy already in place throughout\nthe region due to underlying pressures of livelihood insecu-\nrity. In addition to supplementing rural household incomes,\nremittances may provide additional social benefits that en-\nhance overall assets and sense of empowerment to house-\nholds as well. For example, researchers in Nepal have ob-\nserved that Dalit migrants benefitted from upward social mo-\nbility through their increased income and ability to purchase\nland (Adhikari and Hobley, 2011). Others have found that\nsome groups of women left behind by male out-migrants\nfrom the hills of Nepal were able to participate more ef-\nfectively in community-based forestry initiatives and bene-\nfitted from their status as de facto heads of household (Giri\nand Darnhofer, 2010). At the same time, migration must also\nbe considered in terms of the social and emotional costs.\nwww.earth-syst-dynam.net/6/505/2015/ Earth Syst. Dynam., 6, 505\u2013523, 2015\n510 M. V. Ogra and R. Badola: Gender and climate change in the Indian Himalayas\nWriting about loss of place associated with climate change-\ninduced migration, Adger et al. (2013) note that migration\nunder such circumstances can be maladaptive for some, be-\ncause of the hardship associated with the severing of place-\nbased attachments. Thus, livelihood diversification is perhaps\nnot surprisingly the most prevalent strategy adopted by area\nresidents. As discussed in the next section, diversification in\nthe site includes niche marketing of the unique cultural her-\nitage and ecological features of the NDBR.\n3 Materials and methods\nAs described below, our discussion of the gender-\ndifferentiated impacts of climate change and related case\nstudy of livelihood diversification at NDBR focuses on the\nexperiences of women. In this section, we further explain\nthis focus, introduce the paper\u2019s related research questions,\nand outline our data sources.\n3.1 Focus on women: why women\u2019s experiences still\nmatter\nAs already discussed, analysis of climate change impacts\nand adaptation strategies will be enhanced through differenti-\nated lenses of understanding. Worldwide, poor and marginal-\nized populations already disproportionately experience the\nnegative impacts of climate change (Mearns and Norton,\n2010). It has also been argued that within poor and marginal-\nized groups, women often experience more severe forms of\npoverty relative to men, due to underlying gender inequali-\nties (Demetriades and Esplen, 2010). Discussing health im-\npacts of climate change in the Hindu Kush Himalayan re-\ngion specifically, Eriksson et al. (2008: 14) similarly observe\nthat while mountain communities and ethnic minorities are\nalready socially marginalized, within these groups women,\nthe elderly, children, and the disabled are the most vulner-\nable and as such, \u201cwill suffer the most from the impacts of\nclimate change because they often have less resources to fall\nback upon.\u201d\nAt the same time, we recognize that women do not com-\nprise a homogenous group, and we do not suggest here that\ngender-differentiated impacts fail to apply to men (or mem-\nbers of other gender groups). For example, differences in\noverall economic status between poor and non-poor house-\nholds often overshadow gender differences such that elite\nwomen have more in common with men of their own socio-\neconomic group than with women of different caste and/or\nclass-based or occupational groups (Agarwal, 1992; Roche-\nleau et al., 1996). Age and marital status, as we have our-\nselves argued elsewhere (Badola et al., 2014b) are similarly\nintersecting categories that may overshadow gender differ-\nences between economic groups. However, while economic\nsecurity and caste and/or class may reinforce elite privi-\nlege at the individual scale, perpetuation of gender-based in-\nequities within households nevertheless works to undermine\nwomen\u2019s collective strategic interests (Moser, 1989). Many\nmeasures of gender-based forms of violence, economic in-\nequality, and other forms of deprivation and disparity have\nbeen shown to overwhelmingly negatively affect women as a\ngroup (Seager, 2009b). Culturally embedded and institution-\nalized forms of inequality such as denial of opportunities to\nhealthcare and education, persistence of economic and polit-\nical discrimination, and continued assaults on women\u2019s per-\nsonal safety through sexual violence (to name a few issues)\nare indeed \u201csticky\u201d obstacles, as phrased by the authors of the\n2012 edition of the World Development Report (World Bank,\n2012), and which together help to explain why women\u2019s is-\nsues, in particular, are still central to gender and climate\nchange frameworks. Echoing this idea, the UNFCCC has\nnoted the critical link between women\u2019s empowerment and\nclimate change adaptation, claiming that the empowerment\nof women \u201cwill be a significant factor in meeting the climate\nchallenge and achieving the long-term objectives of the Con-\nvention\u201d (UN, 2014b). Situating her own analytical focus on\nwomen in the area of gender and climate change, Dankelman\nreminds us that all over the world gender relations are charac-\nterized by \u201casymmetry of power between women and men as\na pervasive trait\u201d (2010: 11). Problematizing the connections\nbetween women\u2019s experiences, gender-based inequities lead-\ning to differentiated vulnerabilities, and risks associated with\nclimate change therefore presents a critical opportunity to\nprioritize, galvanize support around, and ultimately address\nthe long-term and \u201csticky\u201d issues noted above.\nYet as development scholars Harcourt and Escobar ob-\nserved in 2005, \u201cToo often the differences between women\nand men become smoothed away in progressive analytical\nframeworks. Knowledge about women continues to be the\nhardest to come by\u201d (quoted in Dankelman, 2010: 11). In\nseeming agreement, Aguilar (2010) outlines three areas of\nknowledge within studies of climate change impacts that\nshe believes must be supported through research: (1) spe-\ncific conditions that shape women\u2019s (and especially poor\nwomen\u2019s) vulnerability; (2) gender-specific risk assessment\nand management; and (3) gendered strategies for enhancing\nadaptive capacity. Thus, we follow Dankelman (2010) and\nAguilar (2010) by maintaining a primary focus on threats\nand opportunities related to women\u2019s livelihoods, highlight-\ning the role of factors such as wealth and ethnicity where we\nare able to do so. We employ this approach to make visible\nthe experiences of resident women that might otherwise be\nsidelined, and in the process seek to contribute to the body\nof related and regional literature. Responding to the political\nurgency of keeping women as a group methodologically and\nconceptually foregrounded, even as we recognize gender as a\nsocially constructed category, 1 our central questions in this\npaper are as follows:\n1In this paper, we focus on primarily on one gender-based group\n(women). Though gender is often aligned with biological sex lines\n(male / female = men /women), we follow social scientists\u2019 con-\nEarth Syst.

Many details reported in this paper are derived from\nfieldwork conducted in the context of a recent interdisci-\nplinary study undertaken for the Wildlife Institute of India,\n\u201cAn Integrated Approach to Reduce the Vulnerability of Lo-\ncal Community to Environmental Degradation in the West-\nern Himalayas, India\u201d (Badola et al., 2014a). Among other\ngoals, this larger project sought to develop an updated so-\ncioeconomic profile for the NDBR, document land-use pat-\nterns and pressures, quantify key ecosystem functions of the\nreserve\u2019s forested landscapes, and identify possible strate-\ngies for sustainable livelihoods. Over a 2-year period (2012\u2013\n2014), members of a WII research team surveyed households\nof 22 randomly selected NDBR buffer zone villages about\nthese topics (n=764). Respondent households were selected\nthrough a stratified random sampling approach that sought to\ninclude residents of different gender, ethnicity, age, wealth,\noccupational and locational categories. Against this back-\ndrop, we were able to concurrently collect additional qual-\nitative data in the form of perceptions about climate change\nand ecotourism as an emergent, alternative livelihood strat-\negy. For this part of the study, our methods emphasized di-\nrect observation, key informant interviews, informal discus-\nsions, and household-level and women-only group discus-\nsions. The resulting qualitative information was grouped and\nhand-coded thematically, then analyzed in terms of the differ-\nentiated vulnerability and SL frameworks discussed above.\n4 Study area\nThe NDBR is a representative wilderness area in the western\nHimalayas, experiencing climate-induced pressures to both\nits physical and social systems. It is perhaps best well known\nfor its role in protecting the world\u2019s fourth-highest mountain,\nNanda Devi Peak (elev. 7817 m), and constitutes an impor-\ntant reservoir of water in the form of glacial ice and snow,\nforests, and high-altitude biodiversity. Development activi-\nties, such as the construction of roads as well as several hy-\ndroelectric projects, have rapidly increased in the region.\nceptualization of gender as a fluid, non-binary, changeable, and cul-\nturally constructed form of identity that varies over time and space.\n4.1 Physical setting\nThe Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve (NDBR) is located be-\ntween 300.05\u2032\u2013310.02\u2032 N latitude and 790.12\u2032\u2013800.19\u2032 E lon-\ngitude, situated in the biogeographical zone of 2B (Rodgers\nand Panwar, 1988). The reserve has a wide altitudinal range\nfrom 1800 to 7817 m. and presently covers an area of\n5860.69 km2, spread over Chamoli district (in Garhwal di-\nvision) and Bageshwar and Pithoragarh districts (in Kumaon\ndivision) of Uttarakhand state. The basin is dominated by the\nNanda Devi mountain, India\u2019s second highest peak (NDBR,\n2002) and revered locally as a symbol of the Hindu god-\ndess, Nanda (Kala and Maihkuri, 2011). The basin is also the\nheadwater of several rivers such as Gori Ganga, Rishi Ganga,\nDhauli Ganga, and Girthi Ganga which forms the Alaknanda\nRiver of the Garhwal Himalayas. Pindari and Milam glaciers\nare important landmarks in the region. The entire area has\nhistorically remained snow bound for more than 6 months of\nthe year, with reaches above 4500 m a.s.l. continually in snow\n(Khacher, 1978). More recent reports cite annual temperature\nranges in the area between 0 and 24 \u25e6C, with average rain-\nfall of 928.82 mm yr falling mainly during July and August\nmonsoon (Kala and Maikhuri, 2011, citing 2002 figures).\nThe area currently experiences three main seasons: winter\n(November to March), with heavy snowfall in the months\nof December, January, and February; summer (April to mid-\nJune) and rainy season (mid-June to September). Most of\nthe flora and fauna protected in the reserve are native and\nendemic, and the reserve has long held species with con-\nservation significance across taxonomic categories. Notable\nanimals include the snow leopard (Panthera uncia), Asiatic\nblack bear (Ursus thibetanus), Himalayan brown bear (Ur-\nsus arctos), Himalayan musk deer (Moschus chrysogaster),\nbharal (Pseudois nayaur), and Himalayan tahr (Hemitragus\njemlahicus).\nIn recognition of the intrinsic value and uniqueness of the\narea, in 1988 the United Nations (UNESCO) designated the\nNanda Devi National Park as a World Heritage Site. The\nlarger biosphere reserve today includes the Nanda Devi Sanc-\ntuary (declared by the Government of India in 1939), the\nNanda Devi National Park (declared in 1982), and the Valley\nof Flowers National Park (incorporated into the core zone of\nNDBR in 2000) (Green, 1993; NDBR, 2002).\n4.2 Local communities\nZonation and human use categories at NDBR are based on\nthe United Nation\u2019s Man and Biosphere (MAB) reserve con-\ncept of balancing basic human welfare and with environmen-\ntal protection through a zonation approach.

The NDBR buffer zone encompasses ar-\neas distributed over the Chamoli, Bageshwar, and Pithora-\ngarh districts. Lata and Reni villages remain among the best\nknown settlements in this region due to their central role and\ninvolvement in the Chipko forest preservation movement of\nthe 1970s\u20131980s and their proximity to desirable trekking\nroute start points. The nearby town of Joshimath is a regional\ntransportation hub that provides the surrounding upland vil-\nlages with secondary school, hospital, and market facilities.\nJoshimath also serves as a base for religious pilgrims and\nother tourists, with state-sponsored and privately run facili-\nties for dining, lodging, and transportation.\nThe dominant ethnic and religious communities residing\nwithin the NDBR are represented by the indigenous Bhotiya\ncommunity and the Garhwali pahari (literally, \u201cof the moun-\ntain\u201d) Hindu communities. Traditional livelihood strategies\nof the Bhotiya tribe were historically based on transhumance\nand seasonal migration to Tibet associated with long-distance\ntrade, but trans-border trade ended in the 1960s due to con-\nflict between India and China. Bhotiyas also suffered hard-\nship in this period from loss of their winter settlements un-\nder the Zamindari Abolition and Land Reform Act of 1960\n(Kala and Maikhuri, 2011). Throughout the NDBR, villagers\nin both groups are today dependent on a harsh and often re-\nmote environment which limits livelihood strategies to a rel-\natively small range of forest- and agriculturally based op-\ntions (Tables 2\u20133). Families mainly practice rain-fed tree\ncrop mixed farming similar to other parts of the central and\nnorthwest Himalayas, cultivate terraced fields for marginal\nsubsistence agriculture and limited cash cropping, and rear\ncattle and sheep for milk. Supplemental income-generation\npractices such as beekeeping, floriculture, and the cultiva-\ntion and collection of medicinal plants are in practice, but\nnot as widespread as in the past. Bhotiya communities also\npractice a traditional craft of weaving, raising sheep for wool\nas well as meat. Other sources of income include wage la-\nbor and short-term employment associated with the 2005\nNational Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) and\nsale of land for hydroelectric or other infrastructure projects.\nWhile we do not have sufficient data to report frequency\nof male out-migration and associated remittances, key infor-\nEarth Syst.

Yet emigration\nof household members also carries a cost: as one informant\ncasually commented, \u201cEveryone wants to go, but not all have\nthe money for it.\u201d\nMost importantly for villages located near road and\ntrekking route heads, adventure and nature tourism has been\nan important source of income through local employment\nof NDBR residents as porters, trekking guides, cooks, ho-\ntel workers, and drivers since the opening up of routes to the\nNanda Devi peak in the 1930s (Kala and Maikhuri, 2011;\nVon Hedemann 2010). Trek guiding is a particularly impor-\ntant occupation, albeit practiced by only a minority of resi-\ndents today for whom the income can be substantial: in one\nanalysis of NDBR guides\u2019 self-reported income, annual earn-\nings ranged from INR 7000 to INR 78 000 (Von Hedemann,\n2010). Gifts from adventure tourists also comprise a minor\nbut socially important resource (Maikhuri et al., 2001). How-\never, the closure of the core zone to tourists and trekking ex-\npeditions in 1982 caused significant hardship; in some com-\nmunities over 90 % of youths were employed as porters and\nguides (Kala and Maikhuri, 2011). Religious tourism associ-\nated with shrines in the area have also long been economi-\ncally important to the regional economy, with pilgrims rep-\nresenting 60 % of the total tourists in the Uttarakhand Hi-\nmalaya by some accounts (Kala and Maikhuri, 2011).\nContinued demand for nature-based tourism throughout\nthe area and a desire to derive additional benefits from biodi-\nversity conservation has led to the promotion of ecotourism\nin some of the NDBR buffer zone villages. In the earlier\ntourism models in this area, the males were largely employed\nas porters and guides to accompany trekking parties leading\nto their absence for long periods of time. This resulted in\nadditional burden of domestic and agricultural work on the\nwomen, without recognition of or compensation for their la-\nbor. It also led to employment for only a small number of\npeople, mostly men with access to the main tourism nodes\nand who were directly employed in such activities. More\nrecently, a culturally linked, homestay-based form of eco-\ntourism is currently being promoted by residents of several\nvillages within the NDBR. Such village-based ecotourism\ngenerates significant income for participating households\nand remunerates the labor contributions made by the entire\nfamily. According to a 2010 study of self-reported homes-\ntay operator incomes in the buffer zone villages of Tolma,\nLata, and Urgam, most of their guests are international na-\nture tourists who pay approximately INR 300 per day and\nwhose visits earn operators an average annual homestay-\nbased income that ranges from INR 490 to INR 141 750 (Von\nHedemann, 2010). Self-reported estimates of the number of\ntourists per year in that study ranged from just 4 to as many\nas 500; removing outliers, the average for these areas in\n2010 was 21 tourists per year, concentrated in the months\nof May\u2013September (Von Hedemann, 2010). Thus, village-\nbased ecotourism provides an opportunity for NDBR resi-\ndents to supplement uncertain seasonal incomes and engage\nin the possibilities of both alternative development trajecto-\nries and strengthening of assets. This is particularly relevant\nfor NDBR communities because the state-led development\nin the region has focused on transportation and hydropower\ninfrastructure projects and failed to promote sustainable local\nlivelihoods, while simultaneously creating additional threats\nto the site\u2019s rich natural and cultural resources.\nAs described by long-term NDBR researchers, \u201cThe socio-\ncultural fabric is as interesting as the natural\u201d (Kala and\nMaikhuri, 2011: 89). Both communities maintain rich tra-\nditions of song, dance, weaving and handloom arts, and\nlinguistic and culinary traditions unique to the mountain\nenvironment. As in many Himalayan communities where\nwomen\u2019s labor is critical to household viability (Badola et al.,\n2014b), our observation is that Bhotiya and Garhwali women\nin the NDBR have both traditionally held (and continue to\nhold) a relatively high status and expect decision-making in\nthe household to be a shared activity between members. At\nthe same time, daily responsibilities and expectations appear\nto follow gender-based divisions of labor found throughout\nthe region, where control of money and capital lie primar-\nily with adult men (i.e., as recognized heads of household\nand wage earners) and adult women in the household have\ngreater control over household resource allocation in day-to-\nday living.2 While agriculture is practiced widely by both\nmen and women, men also seek work for wages. Women\nin the sites we visited were responsible for household food\nproduction and distribution, agricultural labor in the form\nof weeding and cultivation, weaving, sale of NTFPs (non-\ntimber forest products) and milk, and collection of water,\nfuelwood, fodder, and domestic NTFPs. NTFP collection is\nnot confined to women, however: The highest-value NTFP\nO. sinensis (a caterpillar whose cocoon hosts a fungus used\nin traditional Chinese medicine) is collected mainly by men,\nand comprises an important source of supplemental income.\nAs shown in Table 1, larger patterns of asset distribution nev-\nertheless place women (as a group) in a position of strategic\ndisadvantage compared to men (as a group).\n5 Results: women, climate change, and livelihood\ndiversification through ecotourism\n5.1 Gendered dimensions of climate change in the\nNDBR\nModels seeking to understand the long-term effects and\nphysical drivers of climate change in the Himalayas are dis-\ncussed elsewhere in this issue, and suggest the depths, lim-\nits, and shifting terrain of our understanding. As we discuss\nfurther in this section, the meaning of these changes from a\nsocial perspective varies geographically and between groups\n2As shown in Table 2, reported gender expression in the study\narea was also binary (women/men).\nwww.earth-syst-dynam.net/6/505/2015/ Earth Syst.

Badola: Gender and climate change in the Indian Himalayas\nof people, depending largely on the range of assets and ca-\npabilities available for coping and adaption. With Himalayan\nfarmers already in a heightened position of vulnerability due\nto reliance on rain-fed agriculture and natural resources as-\nsociated with the forests of the NDBR, it is important to un-\nderstand how climate change may further impact members\nwithin a household. This holds both within households as\nwell as between households that hold different markers of\nwealth. To give context and a sense for the range of inter-\nconnected impacts of climate change already being perceived\nat the local scale, in this section we summarize impacts re-\nported and observed in the field. Figures 2 and 3 present these\nimpacts in terms of differentiated vulnerabilities for women\nand related impacts on women\u2019s livelihood assets. Narrative\nhighlights, below, help to give context and examples of these\nbroad trends.\nResidents readily spoke to us about livelihood-related\nlosses that they perceived to be related directly to climate\nand/or weather. When we asked people to describe envi-\nronmental changes that they had noticed over the past 15\u2013\n20 years, increased intensity of sun, warmer overall tem-\nperatures, unfamiliar rain and snow patterns, and reduced\nglacial extent (\u201cWhere it used to be snow, now we walk on\nland\u201d) were all cited as examples. However, while mixed-\ngender groups agreed on problems facing their commu-\nnity and described changes in precipitation and temperature,\nwomen\u2019s responses emphasized their knowledge and direct\nexperience as cultivators and laborers in their households\u2019\nagricultural fields. Indeed, loss of generationally communi-\ncated, traditional environmental knowledge (e.g., about tra-\nditionally cultivated crops and related food preparation tech-\nniques, knowledge of identification and extraction techniques\nfor important NTFPs such as edible and medicinal species)\nwas specifically cited by women as an indirect yet impor-\ntant impact of climate change that warranted their concern.\nWomen also reported specific impacts of climate variabil-\nity and change such as more intense hail storms with much\nlarger-sized pellets that damaged apple flowers, untimely\nfrost that damaged rajma flowers, and increased fungal dis-\nease and unfamiliar insect pests in the grain crops that were\nbelieved to be caused specifically by unpredictable and late\nrains. Insect infestation was a recurring complaint. Reflect-\ning dependence on monsoon-fed agriculture, the theme of\nlate rains was prominent in all of our discussions of agroe-\ncological impact. Heavier rainfall was also believed to be the\ncause of an increase in weedy species in the fields.\nDue to combined changes in hail, frost, rainfall, and crop-\nraiding, the women we met with consistently reported that\nthe resulting crop loss was contributing to local food insecu-\nrity and increased dependence on market-based but less nu-\ntritious varieties of vegetables and grains. According to these\nwomen, this contributes to reduced well-being for all mem-\nbers of the household. At the same time, our direct observa-\ntions suggest that as food preparers for the family who pri-\noritize the nutritional and caloric needs of others in the fam-\nily, women\u2019s well-being in this regard is affected to a greater\ndegree. This is particularly the case for poorer households,\nfor which crop failure or loss from damages are more pro-\nnounced in impact.\nIn group interactions, some households also noted that un-\nreliable harvest and uncertainty associated with rain had mo-\ntivated them to shift away from agriculture and in favor of in-\ntensified animal husbandry, although increased crop-raiding\n(by monkeys, boars, porcupines, bears, and mice) was also\nsometimes a factor. Conversely, others told us that families\nare now reducing their total number of animals because of\nlivestock predation problems associated with leopards and\nbears. Still, others took no action, as in the words of one\nwoman: \u201cWe cannot do anything.\u201d\nChanges in the availability of important NDBR resources\nsuch as water, medicinal plants, grass (for fodder) and fuel-\nwood constituted another key indicator of a changing envi-\nronment and reflected women\u2019s labor-based knowledge de-\nspite differences in ethnicity and wealth. We were told that\nthat the extent and variety of trees has been decreasing and\nthe height of native grasses has reduced. In describing the\nindirect effects, women pointed to drops in milk production\nin their cattle due to a lack of high-quality fodder species.\nGrassland and forest degradation was also a major concern,\nreported to not only increase the overall time and distance\nrequired for women to collect fuelwood and fodder, but\nalso their increased risk and concerns of falling from rocky\nslopes. Some reported a decision to purchase fodder in re-\nsponse to declining supplies and increased personal risk; oth-\ners suggested that the increased wildlife sightings in the for-\nest and fear of attack by wild animals was similarly a moti-\nvation to purchase fuelwood.\nLoss and degradation of land associated with flash floods\nand landslides was largely recognized as cloudburst dam-\nage and perceived to be beyond villagers\u2019 control (\u201cDisas-\nter is natural\u201d). However, in areas where hydroelectric power\nconstruction activities constituted the dominant driver of lo-\ncal environmental change, women raised concerns about the\nexacerbating effect of frequent dynamite blasting and land\nclearing. Construction activity in such sites was perceived to\nincrease vulnerability to landslides, drive local deforestation,\nand cause the drying up of local springs. Indiscriminate and\nunsustainable fuelwood cutting from nearby forests by mi-\ngrant laborers was heavily blamed for both fuelwood short-\nages and forest degradation in particular.\nA final set of concerns were reported in terms of intangi-\nble, but important indirect social impacts related to cooper-\nation between women of different households. The change\nin timing of common tasks related to agricultural and for-\nest work was believed to be responsible for fewer opportuni-\nties for women of different backgrounds and households to\nwork together, and competition for limited natural resources\nis starting to contribute to intra-household stress. Moreover,\nwomen told us the younger generation aspires to move away\nfrom traditional livelihoods based on agriculture and use of\nEarth Syst.

The lack of established (or properly functioning)\nvillage-based institutions where women can gather to dis-\ncuss such village-level problems and work cooperatively to\naddress them (e.g., traditional women-only institutions such\nas Mahila Mangal Dal) adds to the impact of the loss of im-\nportant yet time-bound social spaces.\n5.2 Gender and ecotourism in the NDBR\nWith the above discussion as context, in this section we apply\nthe SL framework to the case of ecotourism in the NDBR.\nIn addition to summarizing reported climate-related threats\nin terms of livelihood assets for women, Fig. 3 also illus-\ntrates how ecotourism has the ability to strengthen specific\ntypes of assets. These examples demonstrate the links be-\ntween gender, climate change, and potential for increased\nadaptive capacity of communities through livelihood diver-\nsification. Following the SL framework, we have identified\nsite-specific examples of human (e.g., education, knowledge,\ncultural practices), social (e.g., networks, arenas of status\nand/or power), natural (e.g., environmental resources), phys-\nical (e.g., infrastructure) and financial (e.g., income, wealth,\nland, livestock) assets.\nOur observations in NDBR communities experimenting\nwith ecotourism suggest improvements of key livelihood as-\nsets for women in participant-networked households, partic-\nularly with regard to development of human, social, and fi-\nnancial capital (areas that are often weaker for NDBR women\nas a group, as shown earlier in Table 1). In the households\nthat have homestay facilities, for example, women reported\nthat they benefitted from the opportunities to interact with\nthe tourists afforded through their home-based activities such\nas cooking, cleaning, and creation of a welcoming space\nfor guests. The resulting cultural interaction and mutual ex-\nchange of ideas led to the women feeling that they were\nnow more aware of conservation and development issues, as\nwell as feeling more self-aware in the areas of personal self-\ndevelopment, such as increased attention to self-care (per-\nsonal hygiene, appearance) and knowledge of the surround-\ning areas. We also observed that while wealth largely deter-\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 6, 505\u2013523, 2015 www.earth-syst-dynam.net/6/505/2015/\nM. V. Ogra and R. Badola: Gender and climate change in the Indian Himalayas 517\nmined which households were able to directly participate in\nthe homestay offering, the wider homestay economy carried\nsocial benefits that were distributed more broadly through\nmultiplier effects in the villages. For example, those un-\nable to host tourists still directly benefitted from develop-\nment of public social spaces (village paths, tea stalls, etc.)\nwhere tourists and villagers could interact spontaneously be-\nyond the homestay sites. In this way, the village itself plays\na key part in its role as the larger host. Similarly, neighbors\nof homestay operators benefitted from interactions and in-\nsights achieved through informal visits. Through participa-\ntion in less formalized social networks created and facilitated\nby the homestay model, women also cooperated more with\neach other and earned respect as a group through recognition\nof their key role in raising cash income for their families.\nGreater financial resources at both village and household\nlevel have also translated into assets development for women,\nas personal investments into village facilities for the comfort\nof tourists (such as preparing time-consuming written appli-\ncations for improvement of electrical grid and sanitation in-\nfrastructure) contribute to strengthening of physical capital\nassets across wealth categories. Village- and household-level\nimprovements such as increasing the availability of clean wa-\nter and expansion of toilet facilities promote women\u2019s assets\nby addressing sanitation and hygiene issues that dispropor-\ntionately negatively impact women and children. In addi-\ntion, homestay providers reported that a diversified income\nbase associated with ecotourism led to less reliance on nat-\nural resource extraction in the nearby forests, due to practi-\ncal reason of the extractors being gainfully employed. A re-\nduction in women\u2019s forest-based labor for domestic fuel, wa-\nter, and fodder collection opens up opportunities for women\nand their daughters to strengthen their human capital assets\n(e.g., self-care outcomes, education, job-skills development).\nHowever, even for households with sufficient funds to pur-\nchase fuel and/or fodder, women continue to meet domes-\ntic labor demands that include forest based resource collec-\ntion. (Reasons include house location and relative proximity\nto transportation links (remoteness), cultural traditions asso-\nciated with use of the chullah (cooking fire) and the need\nfor warmth and comfort associated with wood-fueled fires in\nwinter.)\nFinally, we informally observed that in families which\nwere getting regular tourists for their homestays, there was\nless need for long-term male migration. We can tentatively\nsuggest that successful ecotourism operations may thus pro-\nmote family integrity (human capital) through reduction of\nlong-term male out-migration and promotion of a more in-\ntegrated and cooperative model of income generation. Com-\npared to the standing model of labor participation in the re-\ngional tourist industry (in which benefits accrue to families\nprimarily through the contributions of male members work-\ning as porters, guides, cooks, and drivers), homestays repre-\nsented a more inclusive model where both the women and\nmen work together. Although the tasks are still more or less\ndefined and implemented along lines of gender, the overall\napproach is a visibly complementary one (i.e., as compared\nto the earlier version where both worked on different activ-\nities and there was little overlap between their work, and in\nwhich women\u2019s domestic labor was not economically val-\nued). In other words, in the ecotourism homestay households\nwe visited, women and men were both positioned to be val-\nued contributors to a larger, cooperatively based productive\neconomic and domestic system.\n6 Discussion\nThis paper is devoted to the illustration of links between gen-\nder and climate change, with a particular focus on women\u2019s\ndifferentiated experiences and assets needed to strengthen\nadaptive capacities. We have offered details from regional\necotourism experiences to suggest ways that livelihood as-\nsets can be strengthened, as part of a larger climate adap-\ntation approach that employs a differentiated framework as\nits basis. We have shown that women experience gender-\ndifferentiated outcomes related to climate change, and that\nthese outcomes relate closely to critical livelihood assets re-\nquired for sustainable and equitable development. Our ex-\nperiences in the field suggest that gender-based impacts of\nclimate change cut across social categories such as ethnicity\nand caste \u2013 particularly for women whose households are de-\npendent on seasonal agriculture \u2013 due to a gender-based divi-\nsion of labor that is not (as we have so far observed) specific\nto these larger social and economic categories. Income, mi-\ngration status, and household size do however appear to be\ncrucial aspects for sustainable livelihood development, and\nare related directly to household assets and overall capaci-\nties.\nThe climate change impacts we have reported here for\nNDBR are consistent with women\u2019s climate change expe-\nriences emerging in other parts of the Himalayas, for ex-\nample elsewhere in Uttarakhand (Negi et al., 2010), in Hi-\nmachal Pradesh (Kapoor, 2011), and in the mountains of\nNepal (Leduc et al., 2008 and Leduc, 2009; see also Eriks-\nson et al., 2008 and Gentle and Maraseni, 2012, for similar\nreports about climate change impacts to women\u2019s health in\nNepal). As at NDBR, views from the ground in these other\nlocations show that gendered labor practices and other gen-\ndered norms strongly shape women\u2019s knowledge and experi-\nences with climate change. As such, women\u2019s knowledge and\nprioritizations for action need to be made central in broader\ndiscussions of adaption. However, additional and larger-scale\nresearch is needed to generate the comparable data sets that\nwill be required for differentiated action plans. We believe\nthat in seeking women\u2019s participation in such studies, as at-\ntempted here, externally supported adaptation and/or mitiga-\ntion planning can more closely reflect their priorities and thus\nbe supported more effectively. Further work should continue\ninquiry of the role of difference within gender groups. If re-\nwww.earth-syst-dynam.net/6/505/2015/ Earth Syst. Dynam., 6, 505\u2013523, 2015\n518 M. V. Ogra and R. Badola: Gender and climate change in the Indian Himalayas\ngional infrastructural and economic development resources\nare going to come to residents in the name of adaptation\nand mitigation to the impacts of climate change, it should\nhappen in a way that reflects relevant patterns of differenti-\nated knowledge and impacts. Investing in adaptive capacity\nof communities in this manner thus also represents a key op-\nportunity to invest in and promote women\u2019s empowerment, a\ngoal whose achievement is widely held as a prerequisite for\nsustainable development (e.g., as suggested by the Millen-\nnium Development Goals).\nThis study of the NDBR also suggests that household re-\nsponses to crop failure and decreased agricultural yields are\nconstrained in a range of ways that make it particularly dif-\nficult for poor families to enhance or diversify their income\nsources. For women in poor families, however, the hardship\nis compounded. Women from cash-poor households, for ex-\nample, do not have the option of purchasing fuelwood or fod-\nder; thus, the risks and labor costs that women in our study\nreported as inherent to their work increases in the absence of\nalternative assets. Similarly, in the face of recurring climate-\ninduced crop failures or poor yields, switching from agricul-\nture to animal husbandry may be a viable strategy for gener-\nation of cash but could also ultimately undermine household\nnutrition and food security (overseen by women). As others\nhave also observed, Himalayan women are typically \u201cthe last\nto eat and also eat the least\u201d (Negi et al., 2010: 75).\nOur research also demonstrates that ecotourism related\nto NDBR, as an experiment in livelihood diversification, is\nslowly changing the assets profiles of participating women.\nOn the surface, it would seem that the benefits of this\narrangement accrue inequitably in terms of gender: men\nstrengthen their financial and personal assets, status, and role\nas breadwinners through participation in the formal and mon-\netized ecotourism industry; meanwhile, women are typically\ninvolved only in unpaid, traditionally low-status domestic\ntasks such as preparing food, cleaning, and fetching of fu-\nelwood and other natural resources. However, our research\nshows that women\u2019s assets are being strengthened, albeit in\ndifferent domains from men. Increases in women\u2019s cooper-\native arrangements associated with strengthened social capi-\ntal are particularly important, however, because they may ul-\ntimately support emergence of new cooperative institutions\n(e.g., new ecotourism and/or ecodevelopment committees)\nor enable meaningful changes in existing ones (e.g., village-\nlevel governance bodies, Van Panchayat \u2013 forest council, re-\nvival of traditional groups such as Mahila Mangal Dal \u2013\nwomen\u2019s group \u2013 or yuva mandal \u2013 youth group). Rather\nthan remaining silent spectators in formal institutional set-\ntings or limiting their participation to simply adding their\nnames to member attendance rosters, strengthened human\nand social capital assets would help women have more of\na say in decision-making regarding their economic activities\nas well as about management and use of the natural resource\nbase.\nInvolvement of women in ecotourism activities at NDBR\nhas also benefitted the wider community, by broadening the\nspectrum of tourism beneficiaries and expanding the skill sets\nnow held by people engaged in related activities. It is also\nsetting positive examples for others and modeling the poten-\ntial for change to occur through cooperation and challenging\nof previously held beliefs about obstacles and limitations. In\nthe face of increasing vulnerability of traditional agricultur-\nally based livelihoods and pressures for men to out-migrate,\nwe believe that under the right conditions, ecotourism has the\npotential to become an important part of a larger adaptation\nstrategy that strengthens families\u2019 adaptive capacity and re-\nsilience of livelihoods for the mountain regions. These early\nfindings resonate with longer-term experiments elsewhere\nin the region. For example, a larger-scale formal homestay\nprogram organized and run since 2002 by the Sarmoli vil-\nlage Van Panchayat (forest council) in the Pithoragarh dis-\ntrict of Uttarakhand has been linked to both women\u2019s em-\npowerment and improvement of the local village economy\n(Macek, 2012). As in our study, Macek (2012) reports that\nin their role as hosts, Sarmoli women demonstrate leadership\nthrough cooking, interaction with guests, and education of\nguests about their lives and lifestyles; Macek further notes\nthat for some families, the homestay has positioned women\nof the household as the primary income earner and is helping\nvillagers to overcome barriers posed by tradition.\nAt the same time, participation in homestay-based eco-\ntourism is shaped strongly by wealth and other household-\nlevel livelihood assets. A recent study of NDBR homestay\noperators found that related home investments averaged a to-\ntal of INR 172 417 (Von Hedemann, 2010), a figure nearly\ntwice the amount of the reported average annual incomes of\nhouseholds in our study area. Because of inter-group dif-\nferences, the risk of widening gaps between strongly and\nweakly endowed households is therefore a key concern. As\npreviously discussed, those most negatively affected by cli-\nmate change are likely to possess fewer livelihood assets\nthan wealthier (or more educated, effectively networked, or\nmobile) counterparts who are better positioned to be able\nto cope with the stresses of climate change. Such counter-\nparts are also more likely to directly benefit from invest-\nment in ecotourism and hosting tourists. For this to be a\nstrategy that accrues benefits in an equitable, community-\nwide manner, capture of benefits by elites must be antici-\npated and avoided through participatory approaches to plan-\nning and benefit sharing that recognize and develop capac-\nity of all potential beneficiaries. Otherwise, homestays risk\nspreading environmental and cultural costs over the entire\nvillage, whilst only those wealthy enough to invest reap the\nlion\u2019s share of benefits. In addition, while gender concerns\nremain important as an entry point into understanding distri-\nbution of benefits at a finer scale than the household, we note\nthat access to benefits will also be linked to other factors in\nequally critical ways. Though we were not able to focus on\nage in the present study, our previous studies of ecodevelop-\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 6, 505\u2013523, 2015 www.earth-syst-dynam.net/6/505/2015/\nM. V. Ogra and R. Badola: Gender and climate change in the Indian Himalayas 519\nment efforts (including ecotourism) at a range of Himalayan\nsites suggested that age and gender together shaped benefit\nflows in important ways (Badola et al., 2014b). Similarly, a\nstudy of caste interactions and patronage ties between tenant\nfarmers and landholders in the mountains of Nepal found that\nalthough climate change adaptation options were shaped by\ncaste, they simultaneously reinforced existing and unequal\ngender norms related to division of labor and opportunities\nfor income generation (Onta and Resurreccion, 2011).\nEffective use of assets-based models will remain an im-\nportant tool for better understanding the relative strengths,\nweaknesses, constraints, and opportunities facing individu-\nals, households, or communities in the context of climate\nchange. As suggested by our case study, ecotourism can con-\ntribute to the promotion of non-consumptive use of mountain\nresources and (under the right circumstances) can be an im-\nportant tool for providing well-defined livelihood enhance-\nment opportunities, but this is just one example of an alter-\nnative livelihood strategy. We do not wish to suggest that any\none adaptation strategy will be a panacea, or that all NDBR\ncommunities or households should now invest in homestay-\nbased ecotourism. Our goal in discussing the ecotourism ex-\nperiences at NDBR is to demonstrate the value of bringing\nan assets-based approach to questions of adaptive capacity.\nIndeed, in other areas ecotourism has led to weakening of\nassets (Coria and Calfucura, 2012) or led to concerns of cul-\ntural and social erosion (Scheyvens, 1999). Tourism of any\ntype also carries its own footprint. Increased instances of lit-\ntering of non-biodegradable trash, improper waste disposal\nand contamination of water sources along trekking routes are\nexisting impacts at the NDBR itself (Maikhuri et al., 2001).\nHomestay-based accommodation also poses the risk of dis-\npersing such impacts over the host villages as well, if it is not\ncarefully anticipated. In addition, the needs of homestay op-\nerators for additional fuel, food, and water will all contribute\nto local human and environmental costs.\n6.1 Suggestions for action and further research\nClimate change obviously poses myriad challenges, which\nwe believe will increasingly demand a team-based research\napproach that brings together climate scientists, policy and\nsystems modelers, and social scientists. The range of ob-\nserved physical changes already demand, as well, that as re-\nsearchers we work collaboratively to conceptualize the prob-\nlem at all scales \u2013 global, national, regional, and local as\nwell as intra-community and inter-community. It is perhaps\nfrom this latter perspective that differentiated impacts, as\nseen through a lens of gender (in conjunction with other strat-\nifying categories), can best help to inform an applied research\nagenda. Our examples illustrate that because the impacts and\nburdens of climate change are clearly differentiated, adap-\ntation strategies will need to be conceived in ways that are\nboth gender sensitive in the short term and, ideally, socially\ntransformative in the long term (Fig. 4). In addition to techni-\ncal interventions aimed at reducing differentiated impacts of\nclimate change, responsive institutional and research-related\npractices such as gender mainstreaming and gender budget-\ning (e.g., for data analysis, project assessment) will be key\nto advancing the paradigm shift from gender blindness to\nsocially transformative visions of gender justice and equity.\nHowever, as shown in the SL model itself (Figs. 1 and 3),\nsuch changes cannot occur without enabling changes in the\nsurrounding institutional, economic, and cultural landscapes.\nThis has implications for the research, policymaking, and fi-\nnancing landscapes as well as for the communities we aim to\nsupport through our endeavors.\nIn the spirit of speaking across the disciplinary boundaries\nrepresented by this issue of ESD, before closing this paper\nwe offer some questions and ideas for further study. We hope\nthat this discussion stimulates readers to ask themselves how\ntheir own inquiries and methodological approaches can add\nto this starting list. First, the following are areas for consid-\neration by Himalayan climate scientists and policy model-\ners: how can models of changing monsoon patterns be im-\nproved to reflect possible implications for the food crops pre-\nferred by women cultivators, in comparison to cash crops\npromoted by state-based or corporate and/or multinational\nagricultural extension agents? Knowing that certain groups\nof individuals in the high-altitude Himalayas (farmers, el-\nderly residents, and trekking guides, for example) possess\ntremendous knowledge about agro-ecological, glacial extent,\nand forest-based biodiversity changes, how can models of en-\nvironmental change more directly take into account gendered\nand locally produced knowledge? In what ways can predic-\ntive models better reflect the hazards associated with small-\nscale disasters (localized landslides or weather-related crop\nfailures, for example) for different groups \u2013 or provide finer-\nscale data about shifting monsoons, wind patterns, and land\ncover changes, as suggested by IPCC working group mem-\nbers (IPCC-WG2, 2014)? Can spatial models of flood hazard\nfor the region incorporate practices from participatory GIS to\nintentionally reflect the location of gender-based and activist\nnetwork hubs, as researchers in the area of disaster studies\nelsewhere have suggested (e.g., Leduc et al., 2008; Knight et\nal., 2012) as a way to better support members of transgen-\ndered communities?3\nExisting lines of climate change and livelihood research\nundertaken by social scientists and policy and/or systems\n3Recent work in the field of gender and disasters has shown that\nrelief services and support are frequently gender-segregated, func-\ntionally excluding transgender communities such as hijras in In-\ndia, warias of Indonesia, baklas in the Philippines, and LGBTQI\nand/or genderqueer communities in the USA (Balgos et al., 2012;\nDominey-Howes et. al., 2014; Knight et al., 2012). These gender-\nfluid communities are, at the same time, connected through net-\nworks that can be important resources for disaster-related infor-\nmation, services, and support. In breaking away from binary ana-\nlytical models, such research reflects important new directions and\nparadigms for gender and climate change studies.\nwww.earth-syst-dynam.net/6/505/2015/ Earth Syst.

Ultimately, we\nwould urge that researchers of climate change impacts em-\nploy frameworks that include differentiated vulnerabilities,\nwherever possible \u2013 to analyze not only vulnerabilities ob-\nviously shaped by poverty, but also by gender-differentiated\nvulnerabilities in all their variants. It is with this foundation\nthat we will be able to move more effectively toward adap-\ntation and mitigation strategies that build rather than weaken\nthe livelihood assets not only for women, but for all facing\nrisk.\n7 Conclusion\nThe integration of frameworks based on differentiated vul-\nnerabilities offers an opportunity for climate change re-\nsearchers and policymakers to contribute to the ensured vi-\nability of the mountain communities by (a) avoiding the trap\nof gender-blindness in research, policy, and intervention de-\nsigns, and (b) seeking to develop and strengthen livelihood\nassets of vulnerable populations, while (c) simultaneously\nworking to promote the transformation of enabling struc-\ntures. In the Indian Himalayas, we believe that this requires\nrecognition of the largely unacknowledged yet productive\nlivelihood contributions of mountain women, and a prioriti-\nzation of women\u2019s assets development to help promote adap-\ntive capacity at a range of scales. Research and policy col-\nlaboration with local institutions will also be important to\nexpanding forms of social capital and networks of support, in\nthe face of livelihood uncertainty and ecological change. For\nresearchers, increased dissemination of climate-related infor-\nmation and relevant research findings to all affected commu-\nnities can be a related goal. Information supports choice, and\nchoice is required for empowerment and action. By investing\nour time and inquiries in ways that integrate gendered per-\nspectives into larger questions about differentiated vulnera-\nbilities, adaptive capacity, and equity, we can help to provide\nthe support required for Himalayan residents to envision and\ndevelop new sources of strength themselves.\nAcknowledgements.

The prospect of asset stranding could be sufficient to cause potentially affected \ngroups to impede efforts towards low-carbon development, but this possibility has not been \nsufficiently accounted for in the national low-carbon development plans of either developed or \ndeveloping economies. As a result, there is a potential risk to the implementation of such plans. \n\u2022 This paper includes case studies of stranding risk in Brazil, Malaysia and Liberia. In these \ncountries, there are potentially significant risks of stranding, both from regulation and climate \nchange impacts. However, there has been very little consideration of these risks by policy-\nmakers, and there are significant information gaps. \n\u2022 Further research is necessary in the following areas: analysing the outlook for biofuels to assess \nthe risk of stranding and the possible impacts of new technology; assessing the physical impacts \nof extreme weather events on investments, taking into account the role of the insurance industry \nand price fluctuations; and determining whether growing consumer preferences for \u2018sustainable\u2019 \nproducts contribute to the risk of stranding in agriculture and forestry. \n\u2022 Such research could be used to initiate discussions within producer countries about the risk of \nstranded assets given their national strategies and policies, and in light of the available evidence \nof the physical impacts of climate change, in order to identify the options for both mitigating and \nmanaging that risk. \n  \nManaging the Risk of Stranded Assets in Agriculture and Forestry \n      |   Chatham House 2\nIntroduction: Definition and time frames of stranding \n\u2018Stranded assets\u2019 are defined as assets that have suffered \u2018unanticipated or premature write-downs, \ndevaluations, or conversion to liabilities\u2019.1 While stranding may occur for many different reasons, \nthis paper focuses on potential risks arising from climate change in relation to the agriculture and \nforestry sectors, with specific case studies on Brazil, Malaysia and Liberia. In this context, the risks \nof stranded assets can be divided into two broad categories: \n\u2022 Physical risks \u2013 such as land degradation and climate variability, which have various \nconsequences for production and trade; and \n\u2022 Regulatory and economic risks affecting supply chains \u2013 such as new legislation to mitigate \nenvironmental impacts, changes in policies and the interpretation of laws, as well as evolving \nbusiness practices. \nFollowing the landmark Paris Agreement, adopted in December 2015 by the 21st Conference of the \nParties (COP 21) under the auspices of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, it is \nclear that the question of how efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will affect investments is a \ncrucial one. The agreement contains a long-term goal to limit the global temperature increase to \n\u2018well below 2oC above pre-industrial levels\u2019, and to \u2018pursue efforts\u2019 to limit that increase to 1.5oC; \nand achieve a balance between anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals \nby sinks in the second half of the 21st century.  \nScientific assessments suggest that the global carbon budget (the amount of carbon dioxide that can \nbe emitted while limiting global average temperature increases below 2oC) is approximately \n1,000 gigatonnes, and significantly less for 1.5oC.2 This has implications for large emitting sectors \nsuch as energy, transport, forests and agriculture. For example, it is estimated that in order to stay \nwithin the 2oC carbon budget, only around one-third of existing fossil fuel reserves can be burned.3 \nThis means that, depending on the extent to which governments pursue policies consistent with a \nbelow 2oC objective, there is a risk for the remaining two-thirds of the world\u2019s reserves that they \nbecome stranded assets. Moreover, even if efforts to decarbonize the energy sector are successful, it \nwill not be possible to stay below 2oC without addressing emissions associated with agriculture and \nforestry.4 As countries seek to reduce emissions in these other sectors, this brings the risk of \ncreating stranded assets.5 \nTo date, much of the stranded assets debate in relation to climate change has focused on fossil fuels. \nAs implementation of the Paris Agreement moves forward, however, it will be important to consider \nstranding risks across the full range of sectors that will potentially be affected.

In some \ninstances, however, the authors use the short-form AFOLU, encompassing the wider agriculture, forest and other land use sector. \nManaging the Risk of Stranded Assets in Agriculture and Forestry \n      |   Chatham House 3\nthe various physical and regulatory risks can result in stranded assets varies, but the time horizon \nrequired for investors to take note of potential stranding is estimated at between five and 15 years.6 \nMark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, has referred to the \u2018tragedy of the horizon\u2019, \nwhereby impacts beyond a time frame of 15 or so years are often beyond the focus of the financial \ncommunity.7 None the less, as countries establish plans for decarbonization and adaptation to \nclimate change to meet their commitments under the Paris Agreement, these are likely to have \nimpacts on forest and agricultural assets within the 15-year horizon that is critical for investors. \nSimilarly, the physical impacts of climate change are already being seen, bringing risks of stranding \nwithin this horizon. \nThere are important differences between the fossil fuel industry and the agriculture, forest and \nother land use (AFOLU) sector that affect how the concept of stranded assets can be applied. \nWhereas in the case of fossil fuels it has been predicted that stranding will occur across the sector as \na whole, this is unlikely to happen in agriculture and forestry. Rather, the stranding risks for \nagriculture and forestry investments are likely to be differentiated according to sub-sector, practice \nor geography. It is not surprising therefore that the concept of stranded assets has more quickly \nfound acceptance in relation to the extraction of fossil fuels. All the same, a comparison can be \ndrawn with the energy sector as a whole, which encompasses both sustainable (e.g. renewable) and \nunsustainable (e.g. fossil fuel) options, and will thus also have different impacts in different sectors. \nThe closest equivalent to the unsustainable option in the AFOLU sector is the logging of natural \nprimary forests, which are, like fossil fuels, a resource that cannot be replaced. Indeed, reducing \ndeforestation has been identified as the climate change-mitigation action with the largest carbon-\nstock impact in the short term; this is in itself significant as it means that regulatory risks are likely \nto increase and thus increase the probability of stranding in the forest sector.8 \nThe paper provides an assessment of how the concept of stranded assets can be applied to the \nAFOLU sector, draws together initial lessons from a set of case study countries \u2013 Brazil, Liberia and \nMalaysia \u2013 and makes recommendations for further work. \nThe risks of stranding in AFOLU \nIt is critical to recognize that the various factors underlying the risks of stranding do not operate in \nisolation; rather, they have an influence over one another. Changes in regulatory frameworks, for \nexample, may be in response to current or predicted climate-change impacts; but they may also be \nthe result of changes in consumer demand, or in response to campaigns by various pressure groups. \nSimilarly, new legislation can have strong impacts on supply chains and production patterns and in \nthis way affect investment patterns. \n                                                             \n6 Caldecott, B., Tilbury, J. and Carey, C.

A focus on sustainable agriculture and forestry may provide \none means to manage regulatory risks, while adaptation strategies may be able to manage some, but \nby no means all, physical risks. \nAFOLU commodities and regions that pose a risk of stranding \nWith governments and businesses alike seeking to reduce deforestation in supply chains, \nagricultural commodities and production regions that are associated with the conversion of natural \nforests may pose a particularly high risk of stranding. Such commodities include most notably palm \noil, cocoa, beef and soy, all of which have been strong drivers of deforestation over the past few \ndecades in tropical forest regions \u2013 resulting in significant carbon emissions and also impacting on \nglobal carbon storage. \nOther regions where the risk of stranding may be especially high are those where the impacts of \nclimate change are predicted to severely disrupt production cycles or to shift production patterns \nsignificantly, not least owing to changes in rainfall. At the same time, low-carbon development \nplans can affect the regulatory frameworks governing agriculture and forestry activities: for \nexample, they may necessitate the introduction of requirements for certified sustainably produced \ncommodities; changes to land use management (including conservation or sustainable \nmanagement); the introduction of carbon taxes; and the establishment of mandatory emission \nreduction regimes.  \nHowever, many of the areas that are most at risk from economic or regulatory stranding are in \ndeveloping countries with weak governance and capacity-building challenges, which may hinder the \nformulation and adoption of policy responses. \nWhich actors are affected by stranding? \nThe physical and economic factors that may lead to stranding create physical, financial and societal \nrisks across a range of different actors, as shown in Figure 1. If stranding does occur, it is, of course, \nnot only investors who are impacted. The various actors positioned along the whole length of the \nsoft-commodities supply chain may be affected. They include landowners (private and public), who \nbenefit directly from production, and concession- and lease-holders \u2013 for example, those who have \nlong-term rights to timber harvests. In the case of the latter, the impact of the risk of stranding will \ndepend on the structure of the individual concession. To the extent that lease-holders have options \nto exit concessions early, the risk may, ultimately, be faced by the government or the private owner \nof the land. For small landowners, who are likely to have few alternative livelihood options, or those \nlocked into long leases, the cost of stranding will be borne directly by the concession-holders. Small \nManaging the Risk of Stranded Assets in Agriculture and Forestry \n      |   Chatham House 5\nlandowners may be particularly at risk as they lack the resources to invest in adaptation measures \nto manage physical risks, or to diversify into alternative investments/business models in the face of \nregulatory risks. \nFigure 1: Impact of stranding risk factors on different actors \nSource: Adapted by the authors from Caldecott et al. (2013). \nLarger-scale stranding can impact actors involved in the supply chains of the agricultural and forest \nsectors, such as the owners \u2013 whether private or state \u2013 of infrastructure (dedicated roads, railways \nor port terminals, etc.) to transport or process agricultural and/or forest commodities that have \nbecome obsolete. Traders of such commodities may also be exposed to risks, especially if there are \nmajor changes in production patterns over a longer period. While the global commodities trade is \ndominated by a small number of very large corporations, which may well be able to absorb the \nimpact of individual risks and, by adopting a diversified portfolio, maintain market dominance, \nthere may none the less be impacts on company value if production and consumption patterns shift \nas a result of climate change. Given that the supply chain progresses from the producer via the \ntrader, processor and manufacturer to the retailer, the risk of a significant impact from stranding is \nlikely to diminish the closer the player is positioned to the consumer; this applies not only to private \ncompanies but also to the shareholders and investors in publicly traded companies. The scale of \nrisks to the financial and insurance sectors may be determined by the same factor. \nUltimately, stranding may also have societal impacts. This may include risks to natural capital and a \nloss of ecosystem service provision (see Box 1). It may also affect employment if forest commodity \nproduction is significantly impacted, as well as associated tax revenues and the balance of trade. All \nof these factors could result in increased stress on governance systems in developing countries with \nsignificant forest assets. \n \nIncreased weather variability, \nwater scarcity and climate \nchange \nStranding Risk Factors \nLand degrada on \nBiodiversity loss \nIncreased risk of agricultural \ndisease, virus and pests  \nGreening of agricultural value \nchain \nLand use regula ons \nTechnology change \nGreenhouse gas regula on of \nsinks \nP\nh\ny\nsi\nca\nl \nE\nco\nn\no\nm\nic\n \nPhysical Assets Financial Assets Societal Assets \nDegrada on of \nforests through \ndrought and heat \nDamage to physical \ninfrastructure (e.g. \nroads, rail and ports) \nChange in demand \nfor forest related \ncommodi es \nChange in demand \nfor forest related \ncommodi es \nLoss of value for land \nowners (both private \nand government) \nLoss of value for \ninfrastructure owners \n(both private and \ngovernment) \nLoss of value for \nupstream and \ndownstream \nproducers of \nunsustainable forest \ncommodi es \nLoss of natural capital \nand reduc on in \necosystem services \nImpact on na onal \nemployment, tax \nrevenues and trade \nManaging the Risk of Stranded Assets in Agriculture and Forestry \n      |   Chatham House 6\nPhysical risks of stranding \nIt is predicted that forests around the globe will be significantly affected by climate change: inter \nalia, the frequency of forest fires will increase, pests and diseases will be more widespread, and \nthousands of species may become extinct. Ecosystem services such as water regulation and \npurification, carbon storage and soil protection will also be affected. It has been estimated that \u2018the \nglobal economic cost of the climate change impacts of deforestation will rise to around $1 trillion a \nyear by 2100 if unabated\u2019.12 \nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) expects all aspects of food security to be \npotentially affected by climate change, including food access and utilization as well as price \nstability. The IPCC assesses that there is a medium to high risk that by 2030 reduced crop \nproductivity due to droughts will have an adverse effect on regional, national and household \nincomes and food security. In particular, damage to forests and agricultural land may be caused by \npests and disease, and by the impact of more flooding on the food system infrastructure. A number \nof climate change-related impacts can already be observed, including changes to the hydrological \nsystem that influence both the quality and the quantity of available water resources resulting in \nnegative impacts on crop yields \u2013 particularly, according to the IPCC, those for wheat and corn.13 \n                                                             \n9 Waves Partnership (2014), \u2018Natural Capital Accounting \u2013 List of Supporters\u2019, \nhttps://www.wavespartnership.org/sites/waves/files/documents/NCA%20supporters%20060314.pdf.  \n10 Hickey, V.

N., MacCracken, S., Mastrandrea, P. R. and \n \nBox 1: Natural capital \nStranded assets in agriculture and forestry could be influenced by the debate on natural capital (the world's \nstock of natural assets) from which a wide range of ecosystem services are derived. Even though the concept \nof natural capital is not globally accepted, it can allow for the quantification of financial impacts from \nstranded assets and therefore influence the decision-making of investors and other stakeholders exposed to \nthe risk of stranding. It has been suggested that the framework for natural capital accounting, which is \nbeing supported by more than 70 countries as well as by a large number of companies and NGOs,9 could be \nused to measure progress towards achieving the targets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).10 \nSince natural capital is not currently included in investor and corporate balance sheets, the role that natural \nassets play in underwriting financial value and the risks associated with those assets is often insufficiently \nrecognized. A 2013 study concluded that there is 0.5 per cent chance of an annual natural capital loss of, \nrespectively, $6.3 trillion, $8.7 trillion and $11.2 trillion in the current, moderate and extreme scenarios \n(0.5 per cent being a value commonly used in the insurance industry for solvency calculations).11 Regulatory \nefforts aimed at giving more weight to natural capital considerations in determining financial value could \ntherefore increase the awareness of stranding risks. \nManaging the Risk of Stranded Assets in Agriculture and Forestry \n      |   Chatham House 7\nCrops such as soy will also be affected. For example, it has been estimated that by 2030 Brazil could \nlose as much as 10 million hectares of cropland because of climate change: in the optimistic \nscenario, key growing areas for soy could decrease by around 15 per cent; and in the pessimistic \nscenario by 28 per cent.14 In the United States, another key soy producer, yields are forecast to \ndecrease by up to 80 per cent by the end of the 21st century;15 climate-related losses for the industry \nthere have already reached $11 billion.16 Other stranded assets could include oil palm plantations. \nAccording to models based on IPPC forecasts, in some low-lying production regions in Malaysia \nnearly all peatland is expected to be lost for production \u2013 much of it within decades: it is projected \nthat some 42 per cent of current industrial plantations in the Rajang Delta will experience problems \nassociated with reduced drainage by 2034.17 Taking a natural capital approach, the Smith School at \nOxford University has estimated the total value of investments at risk of stranding in the agriculture \nsector at between $6.3 trillion and $11.2 trillion across a range of different scenarios.18 \nClimate variability is another factor that can turn investments into stranded assets \u2013 particularly \nthe increased danger of extreme weather events and related disasters, which affect agriculture more \nthan other sectors. Of the total damage and loss arising from the drought in Brazil in 2013, \nestimated at some $10 billion, agriculture accounted for 43 per cent. In Pakistan the floods in 2010 \ncaused damage and losses estimated at $10.1 billion (equivalent to almost 6 per cent of gross \ndomestic product \u2013 GDP), half of which in the agriculture sector.19 To the extent that repeated \nextreme weather events undermine the future viability of forest commodity production in a region, \nsuch incidents can create stranded assets. These can arise both through impacts on the land itself, \nwhereby yields are consistently undermined with the effect that production operations have to be \nabandoned and relocated; and through impacts on related infrastructure such as roads, ports and \nrailways, as a result of which it is no longer possible to transport goods to markets. \nAdaptation and new technologies may be able to reduce some of the physical risks of stranding. \nInvestment in resilient infrastructure, water management and drainage systems, as well as \nimproved crop varieties, could all reduce such risks. However, there are limitations to these: as \nclimate change gathers pace, in some parts of the world \u2013 particularly those that are most \nvulnerable to climate impacts \u2013 adaptation strategies may no longer be viable.20 \nIn summary, the stranding of assets from physical risks is likely to occur, or is already occurring, \nwithin the relevant, 15-year time frame for decision-making among investors.

It is thought that much of that impact will be due to changes in rainfall \npatterns and soil moisture, although there is still no consensus on the most likely impact scenarios. \nAccording to one study, Brazil could lose more than 11 million hectares of cropland by 2030 \u2013 although \nimpacts are predicted to vary from crop to crop.21 The consequent decline in production and the associated \nincrease in commodity prices could make stranded assets a possibility in some regions; but, equally, those \ndevelopments could mean increased returns on certain investments. \nThe effects of extreme weather events are illustrated not only by the drought in 2013 (referred to above), but \nalso by the drought in late 2014 and early 2015 \u2013 the worst in 80 years: an estimated 4 million people were \naffected by factors including power cuts, protests and business closures. Arabica coffee production fell 15 \nper cent in 2014, due to the low rainfall that year, pushing the global price of that commodity up by almost \nhalf. (Brazil is the world\u2019s largest Arabica producer.)22 \n \nMalaysia \nMore frequent extreme weather events are already having a significant impact on the Malaysian agricultural \nsector. For example, severe droughts followed by flooding in 2014 caused a sharp decline in palm oil \nproduction.23 \nFrom an investment perspective, such declines are not necessarily problematic in the medium term. In mid-\n2015, for example, major palm oil producer Sime Derby predicted a 6 per cent decrease in production in the \nevent of a moderate El Ni\u00f1o (which in the case of Southeast Asia creates unusually dry climatic conditions), \nand a 15\u201320 per cent drop if the occurrence was extreme. However, while the initial impact can be a \ndownturn in business, price increases usually follow: El Ni\u00f1o events in 1997\u201398, 2006 and 2009\u201310 \ncontributed to price increases of 75 per cent, 40 per cent and 22 per cent, respectively, according to analyst \nreports.24 Sime Derby\u2019s stated intention prior to the 2015\u201316 El Ni\u00f1o was to manage the impact on yields, \n\u2018in order to ride on the opportunities of an increase in [crude palm oil] prices\u2019.25 This would suggest that \nthere is awareness of risks from climate variability in the business community \u2013 although any variability \nManaging the Risk of Stranded Assets in Agriculture and Forestry \n      |   Chatham House 9\nRegulatory and economic risks of stranding \nThe large volume of emissions in the AFOLU sector provide huge abatement and mitigation \nopportunities, as a result of which a number of mitigation strategies are being discussed or are \nalready being applied in agriculture and forestry. A lack of detailed data and modelling hitherto \nmean that it is not possible to state in detail the potential financial losses, but it is none the less \nevident that, depending on the time frame in which they are implemented, regulatory initiatives are \nlikely to impact investments, shares and physical assets. \nUntil recently, mitigation efforts were directed at forestry rather than agriculture. Forestry has \ntherefore been one of the main focuses at international climate change negotiations, while debate \non agriculture has been marginal. The situation has begun to change in the past several years, \nhowever, with the recognition first that the main driver of deforestation globally is agriculture, and \nalso that there may be significant opportunities for emissions reductions in agriculture. There are \nnow numerous voluntary initiatives by the private and public sectors towards achieving the goal of \nzero or net zero deforestation in both agriculture and forestry. Prominent such initiatives are the \nNew York Declaration on Forests, endorsed by more than 150 governments, companies and \n                                                             \n26 Sujahangir, K.

According to \none study, some 1,000 km2 of cropland in Malaysia could be destroyed by 2100 if the sea level were to rise \nby 90 cm;26 while another study suggests that various low-lying palm oil production areas could be severely \naffected over the next 20 years.27 \n \nLiberia \nClimate change is predicted to have significant impacts on weather variability, temperatures and sea levels \nin Liberia. Simulations suggest that, on average, temperatures in Liberia will rise by 1.6oC, 2.5oC and 3.4oC \nby the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s, respectively, while national rainfall levels will increase by 3.4 per cent, \n3.7 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively, and become increasingly variable.28 This could have far-reaching \nconsequences for the hundreds of thousands of smallholders in Liberia. Indeed, according to one study, no \nless than 96 per cent of smallholders report that climate change has already affected productivity.29 There \nare no available data on the potential impact of the physical risks of climate change on investments in \nLiberia; but since such investments focus on perennial crops such as oil palm and rubber as well as forest \nconcessions, it is likely that they could be affected in the same way as described in the Malaysian case study.  \nManaging the Risk of Stranded Assets in Agriculture and Forestry \n      |   Chatham House 10\nindigenous peoples\u2019 and civil society organizations at the UN Climate Summit in 2014,30 and the \nTropical Forest Alliance 2020.31 \nThe timing of this shift can be linked to the publication of several significant studies that have \nconcluded that radical changes to the world\u2019s food system are needed in order to ensure its long-\nterm sustainability. Climate change mitigation measures include the increased use of agroforestry \nand agroecology as production systems; removing deforestation from global supply chains; boosting \nsoil carbon sequestration through improved tillage systems and crop rotations; phasing out energy-\nintensive chemical fertilizers; ensuring better management of livestock, pasture and water; \nreducing global meat consumption; and eliminating food waste.32 The extent to which mitigation \nactivities can cause stranding depends on the speed at which the relevant legislation or changes in \nbusiness practice (e.g. zero deforestation commitments) are implemented. That speed is likely to be \nfaster in countries that have ambitious emission reduction targets coupled with significant \nmitigation potential from agriculture \u2013 although this will also be dependent on a country\u2019s ability to \nimplement such targets (a consequence of its resources and level of governance). \nFollowing the Paris Agreement, the establishment of the long-term goal to include a reference to \nboth 1.5oC and achieving a balance between anthropogenic emissions and removals by sinks has \nimportant implications for forest assets. Given current emission trajectories, it is increasingly likely \nthat negative emission technologies will be required in order to stabilize global average temperature \nincreases to below 2oC.33 This implies the need for large-scale development and deployment of \nbioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) technology \u2013 whereby the carbon used in a \nplant\u2019s development is captured and stored as it is converted into energy, thus leading to a net \nreduction in CO2 in the atmosphere. This may shift policy objectives from reducing emissions from \nland use change to utilizing land as a source for bioenergy crops. A recent study suggested that \nunder a 2oC-compatible scenario, between 7 and 25 per cent of agricultural land would be required \nfor bioenergy production in relation to BECCS.34 \nIn some sectors, particularly the palm oil industry, there is growing awareness of the impacts that \nclimate change mitigation activities may have on business operations. Malaysia\u2019s Bousted \nPlantations Berhad, for example, noted in its initial public offering (IPO) prospectus that there was \nlikely to be continued pressure to demonstrate sustainable practices in the palm oil sector, and that \nthe industry could increasingly be constrained by both government legislation and the policies of \nconsumer companies.35 \n                                                             \n30 See Forest Declaration, http://forestdeclaration.org/. \n31 See Tropical Forest Alliance 2020, https://www.tfa2020.org/. \n32 See for example Government Office for Science (2011), Foresight: The Future of Food and Farming \u2013 Final Project Report, London: \nGovernment Office for Science; and Paillard, S., Tr\u00e9yer, S. and Dorin B.

According to one estimate, the use of biofuels \u2013 particularly ethanol and biodiesel \u2013 is \nexpected to provide 9 per cent of global demand for transport fuel in 2030,36 and a number of \ncountries already mandate the use of biofuels (to reduce both emissions and reliance on imported \nfossil fuels). However, the context of a relatively fast-changing regulatory framework, along with the \npotential social and environmental impacts, puts investments in the industry (particularly \ndownstream investments such as refineries) at risk of becoming stranded assets. In particular, \ninvestments in first-generation biofuels that compete with food crops on arable land will be \nendangered. The European Union (EU) has acted to cap the use of food crops that can be used to \nmeet its 2020 renewable transport fuel target, and is already working on legislation to ensure a \nspeedy transition to second-generation biofuels, which cause fewer emissions and reduce indirect \nland use change (whereby biofuels displace food crops to previously non-cultivated land such as \ngrasslands or forests). The combination of the cap on first-generation fuels and the collapse in the \noil price has fundamentally undermined the economics of some biofuel production and may lead to \nstranding for the enterprises and associated infrastructure. \nThe major international goals and agreements reached in 2015 represent another source of change \nthat may affect investments in natural resources. The SDGs, adopted at the end of 2015 to \nsupersede and build on the Millennium Development Goals, comprise 17 goals (within which 169 \ntargets) that will influence international development priorities within the period 2016\u201330 (i.e. \nwithin a time frame that is currently relevant to stranding).37 Most relevant to the stranding of \nassets in agriculture and forestry are: \n\u2022 SDG 2.4: By 2030, ensure sustainable food production systems and implement resilient \nagricultural practices that increase productivity and production, that help maintain ecosystems, \nthat strengthen capacity for adaptation to climate change, extreme weather, drought, flooding \nand other disasters and that progressively improve land and soil quality. \n\u2022 SDG 15.2: By 2020, promote the implementation of sustainable management of all types of \nforests, halt deforestation, restore degraded forests and substantially increase afforestation and \nreforestation globally.  \nIn addition to the SDGs, the ratchet mechanism in the Paris Agreement, whereby pledges will be \nrevisited every five years in an effort to close the gap with a below 2oC trajectory, should result in \nincreasingly ambitious mitigation targets. This is likely to be a driver of increased action on \ndeforestation (among other measures), and so bring an increased risk of regulatory-driven \nstranding in the future. If resources are adequate and indicators sufficiently well designed to help \nensure implementation, both the Paris Agreement and the SDGs could have a significant impact not \nonly on agricultural production systems that do not support sustainable development targets but \nalso on investments into those systems. \n                                                             \n36 Forecasts from World Energy Outlook 2009, cited in Eisentraut, A.

Much depends \non whether an active market for such instruments is created. REDD+ aims to create financial value \nfor the carbon stored in forests through forest protection, sustainable forest management and the \nenhancement of carbon stocks. Although the REDD+ rules are now largely complete, the market \nhas not yet developed to the extent that had been expected. In particular, the number of private-\nsector investments has been insufficient. It has been suggested that REDD+ projects could be used \nas a hedging strategy against stranded assets in the fossil fuel sector,38 but it appears that the \nvoluntary nature of the market does not provide the necessary clarity for investors. Moreover, it is \nnot currently planned to introduce a regulatory market. \nIn the absence of such a market, some current investments \u2013 the vast majority of which were \nfinanced from public funds \u2013 could fall significantly in value. Another concern is the time lag \nbetween the signing of the Paris Agreement in 2015 and its scheduled entry into force in 2020. This \nmeans that the necessary incentives for REDD+ to function may not be in place for some time to \ncome.39 \nThe impacts of regulatory risks on AFOLU stranding in case study countries is considered in Box 3. \n                                                             \n38 Laing, T., Taschini, L., Palmer, C., Wehkamp, J., Fuss, S. and Reuter, W.

Moreover, since Brazil is a leading exporter of ethanol, policies and \nregulations on biofuels in other markets could affect both production and investments in Brazil. The EU, for \nexample, is committed to ending its contribution to natural forest loss, not least by changing its own \nconsumption and trading patterns; and since it is a major importer of Brazilian agricultural commodities \u2013 \nin particular soy for animal feed \u2013 policy initiatives such as an EU action plan on deforestation, the \nmandatory labelling of the forest footprints of products, or imposing sustainability criteria for imported \ncommodities may affect exports of and, ultimately, investments in Brazilian agricultural products that are \nlinked to deforestation.43 \nHaving once numbered among the countries most criticized for not tackling deforestation, Brazil is now \nacknowledged for its extraordinary success in reducing the rate of deforestation by some 70 per cent, \nachieved through a range of measures including improved law enforcement, expanding protected areas and \npolicies to restrict agricultural expansion.44 However, stranded assets are not currently discussed in \ngovernment policy papers; nor has the NGO community, which has played an important role in securing \nmoratoriums on deforestation in the soy and beef industry, been communicating the investment risks of \nsuch actions. This may be because much of the deforestation that has been halted was illegal, and so there \nwere no \u2018legal assets\u2019 at risk of stranding. The close engagement with the private sector in many of the \nmeasures adopted is also likely to have been a factor in reducing any risks of stranding. \n \nMalaysia \nMalaysia is the world\u2019s second largest producer of palm oil (after Indonesia), which generates some 5\u20136 per \ncent of annual GDP.45 The AFOLU sector overall accounts for more than 30 per cent of national emissions. \nMalaysia\u2019s INDC pledges a 45 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions intensity of GDP by 2030, \ncompared with the 2005 level (35 per cent unconditional, and 10 per cent conditional on sufficient \nfinancing, technology transfer and capacity-building assistance from developed countries).46 \nUnder Malaysia\u2019s National Transformation Programme, there are a number of entry point projects (EPPs) \nspecific to the oil palm sector that may be vulnerable to regulatory stranding risks. For example, the first \nEPP is focused on replanting oil palm plantations and establishing new plantations by providing support to \nindependent smallholders.47 Another goal is to secure investments in order to increase downstream palm oil \nactivities, especially in segments that generate high-value products such as palm oil derivatives.48 \nManaging the Risk of Stranded Assets in Agriculture and Forestry \n      |   Chatham House 14\n \n                                                             \n49 The full text of Liberia\u2019s INDC is available at \nhttp://www4.unfccc.int/submissions/INDC/Published%20Documents/Liberia/1/INDC%20Final%20Submission%20Sept%2030%202015.0\n02.pdf.

Threatens Anti-Forest GOL Letter of Intent\u2019, Liberian Observer, 14 October 2014, \nhttp://liberianobserver.com/news/timber-assn-threatens-anti-forest-gol-letter-intent.  \nRegulation that affects future palm oil production either through domestic policy aimed at reducing \nemissions, or through action to limit unsustainable palm oil consumption in importer countries, could \nresult in stranding risks along the palm oil supply chain. However, the issue of stranded assets is not \nmentioned \u2013 either directly or indirectly \u2013 in any of the strategies or focus areas included in the \nprogramme. \n \nLiberia \nLiberia\u2019s INDC contains an emissions reduction target of 15 per cent below the business-as-usual scenario \nby 2030, and a longer term ambition of carbon neutrality by 2050.49 Attainment depends on financial \nresources, capacity-building and the transfer of technologies. Both the agriculture and forest sectors are \nconsidered to be under the \u2018adaptation\u2019 category in the INDC. There are plans to invest in new adaptive and \nresilient technologies, new farming techniques and production systems, the cultivation of more resilient \nspecies, and the sharing of knowledge on best practice, as well as in increasing awareness about, and the \nparticipation of local people in, forest conservation, protection of forest zones and reforestation of degraded \nlands. \nIn a 2014 letter of intent between the governments of Norway and Liberia, it was set out that the Norwegian \ngovernment would provide Liberia with $150 million in support of efforts to reduce emissions from \ndeforestation through the greening of supply chains, the protection of forests and the promotion of \nsustainable agriculture.50 A number of activities that are covered by the agreement have the potential to \naffect planned or existing investments, among them the imposition of moratoriums on new industrial \nlogging concessions, the suspension of companies suspected of involvement in illegal logging, and \nexamination of the legality of existing concessions. Furthermore, the agreement envisages that some 30 per \ncent of Liberia\u2019s forest estate will be given protected area status. As regards the agriculture sector, it is \nenvisaged that only multinational companies that have drawn up and adhere to zero deforestation policies \nwill be permitted to do business in Liberia.  \nGiven that large areas of as yet undeveloped land have already been purchased or are under concession \nagreements in Liberia, the letter of intent could put a significant number of investments at risk of stranding. \nThis seems already to have been recognized by industry. Shortly after the letter of intent was released, the \nLiberia Timber Association (LTA) announced that it was considering legal action to prevent ratification of \nthe agreement by the Liberian parliament. According to the LTA, the planned measures would be \ndetrimental to the development of forest communities as well as to the interests of investors, businessmen \nand thousands of Liberians who are currently employed in the forest industry.51 \nManaging the Risk of Stranded Assets in Agriculture and Forestry \n      |   Chatham House 15\nConclusions and recommendations for further research \nThere are credible reasons why stranded assets in agriculture and forestry may result from climate \nchange. This will be driven both by the physical impacts of climate change, and by the economic and \nregulatory responses to mitigate those impacts. Both of these factors may accelerate as the existing \ncarbon budget is used up, and as post-Paris Agreement policy responses are developed and \nimplemented. \nIt is at present difficult to analyse stranding risks precisely. The likelihood of stranding is subject to \na range of uncertainties, among them how climate change affects geographies; how different actors \nrespond; and how companies and farmers adapt. Notwithstanding, further study of the risks of \nstranding is greatly needed, as are strategies for how these can be managed by investors and \ncompanies. Key areas for research include: \n\u2022 Analysing by region the outlook for biofuels to assess the risk of stranding and the possible \nimpacts on investment of new technologies, such as electric vehicles or hydrogen fuel cells, both \nof which will affect future demand for this form of energy; \n\u2022 Assessing the physical impacts on investments of extreme weather events such as droughts and \nfloods, taking into account the role of the insurance industry as well as price fluctuations \ngenerated by production decline and the resulting impact on assets and their performance; and \n\u2022 Exploring the risks of stranding in the agricultural and forestry sector arising from growing \nconsumer preferences for \u2018sustainable\u2019, \u2018deforestation-free\u2019 or \u2018low-carbon\u2019 products. \nResearch in these areas could, furthermore, be used to initiate discussions within key producer \ncountries about the risks of stranding that may result from their national strategies and policies. It \ncould also be used to highlight the available evidence of the physical impacts of climate change. The \naim of any such in-country discussions should be to identify effective ways of mitigating and \nmanaging these risks. \n  \nManaging the Risk of Stranded Assets in Agriculture and Forestry \n      |   Chatham House 16\nAbout the authors \nMario Rautner is a researcher and consultant who has worked for many of the largest \nenvironmental and conservation organizations.

Women in rural \nareas are more vulnerable to climate change and climate-\nrelated risks due to existing social norms and gender \ninequalities (limited ownership and control over \nproductive assets/resources, decision-making power, \naccess to information, extension services, market etc.) \nand multidimensional social factors. These gender \ninequalities affect the ability of women to adapt to climate \nchange. On the other hand, women have unique \nknowledge and skills that can help create effective and \nsustainable responses to climate change (Habtezion \n2013).  \nIn Ethiopia, rural women play a critical role in agriculture, \nwith up to 45% of the total agricultural labor force \ncomposed of women (FAO 2019). However, in terms of \nasset ownership and decision-making, women only hold \n18.7% of farmland and are household heads in 20% of \nrural households in Ethiopia. In addition, crop productivity \nper hectare in female-owned farms across rural Ethiopia \nis 35% less when compared to male-owned farms due to \nlower levels of input use and less access to extension \nservices (UN Women 2018). \nFrom 2018, the CGIAR Research Program on Climate \nChange, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) in \ncollaboration with the International Center for Tropical \nAgriculture (CIAT), Africa RISING (a sustainable \nagricultural intensification research program supported by \nthe United States Agency for International Development \n(USAID)), the International Center for Agricultural \nResearch in the Dry Areas (ICARDA), the International \nLivestock Research Institute (ILRI), Inter Aide France and \nAreka Agricultural Research Center, has been working \nwith farmers to evaluate and promote climate-smart \nagriculture (CSA) practices in the Doyogena climate-\nsmart landscape as part of efforts to help the community \nmanage climate-related risks and adapt to climate \nchange.  \n C C A F S  I N F O  N O T E  2  \n \n  \nDespite efforts to build the resilience of the community in \nthe area, women\u2019s active involvement in climate-smart \npractices has not been thoroughly assessed. To address \nthis gap, this study was undertaken by CCAFS and UN \nWomen to provide qualitative and quantitative information \nthat examines gender inequalities, social factors and the \nimpacts on women\u2019s vulnerabilities and adaptive \ncapacities regarding agricultural value chains in the \ncontext of climate change. \nMethods \nA Rapid Gender Assessment (RGA) was conducted \nwithin three kebeles1 of Doyogena climate-smart \nlandscape in Southern Ethiopia. The kebeles included \nGomora Gewada, Lemi Suticho and Ancha Sedecha. \nDoyogena district is densely populated (about 700 \ninhabitants/km\u00b2), with a per capita land size of less than \n0.5 hectares (Getamesay 2014). Agriculture is the main \nlivelihood source in the area. The farming system is rain-\nfed mixed crop-livestock, characterized by low \nproductivity. Main crops grown include wheat, barley, \npotato, vegetables and enset (Ensete ventricosum). The \nmajor livestock for rearing and fattening include cattle (for \nmeat, dairy and ploughing), sheep and poultry. \nThe RGA employed a household survey (both male \nheaded households (MHH) and female headed \nhouseholds (FHH)), focus group discussions (FGDs) with \ndifferent community members and key informant \ninterviews (KIIs) with local leaders and experts form \ninstitutions including the district agricultural office, \nwomen, children and youth office, kebele administrators \nand women leaders in the area. A total of 149 households \n(46 FHH and 103 MHH) were surveyed. In the case of \nMHHs, both spouses were interviewed separately. A total \nof 12 FGDs were conducted from the three kebeles to \ncollect qualitative data. Four categories/groups of FGDs \nwere conducted with female community members (3 \nFGDs), male community members (3 FGDs), combined \nmale and female leaders (3 FGDs) and FHHs (3 FGDs). \nThe RGA assessed the gender gap between men and \nwomen and generated evidence on access to and control \nover productive assets; access to services; gender roles \nand division of labor in households and community; and \nroles in decision making and participation in leadership.  \n \nWomen\u2019s access and control over \nproductive assets   \nThe results from the FGDs, KIIs and household surveys \nshow that men dominate the control of major and \nvaluable productive resources including agricultural land, \n \n1 Kebele is the smallest administrative unit in Ethiopia \nlarge livestock and farming equipment. Women only have \ncontrol of assets that are of lesser economic value such \nas chicken, eggs, milk and milk products.  In most cases, \nhusbands may consult wives regarding the sale of assets, \nbut the decision of the husband is usually final. Although \nmen respondents indicated that there is a joint ownership \nof assets, the FGDs conducted with exclusively women \nindicate that women have limitations in terms of control \nover assets. This finding was similar to information \ngathered from sector offices that also confirmed that there \nis a high probability that men dominate in control over \nresources. Figure 1 shows that as land size increases, \nownership tends to be dominated by men. Discussants \nalso shared that women and men have access to \ncommunal resources such as water (for irrigation, animal \nfattening and consumption) but the control is dominated \nby men. Also, women and men have shared ownership \nwhen it comes to small ruminants, however, information \ngathered indicates that men make the major decisions \nregarding sales and control over cash.      \nThe differences in access to and control over productive \nassets/resources have impacts on women\u2019s ability to \nadapt to climate change. According to DeVoe et al. \n(2018), gender equality is critical in addressing climate \nchange issues. Therefore, empowering girls and women \nto have access to and control over productive assets is a \nkey foundation towards enhancing women\u2019s ability to \nadapt to climate change.  \n \nFigure 1. Land size holding by gender in Doyogena, Ethiopia.  \nAccess to services  \nWomen\u2019s lack of access to services such as primary edu-\ncation, agricultural and health extension services has em-\nanated from multifaceted challenges/issues including lim-\nited awareness/information, cultural norms, gender roles, \npoor infrastructure facilities, household workload and the \ncapacity, gender responsiveness and willingness of ser-\nvice providers. For instance, since women\u2019s roles are for \nthe most part, restricted to the home environment and they \nare burdened with household chores, they are not exposed \nto information sources regarding available services. In \n \n C C A F S  I N F O  N O T E  3  \n \n  \ncontrast, men's gender roles are mainly performed outside \nthe house giving them the privilege of easily accessing in-\nformation.  \nWomen lack access to capacity building opportunities and \nformal financial services in the area including credit with \nlimited production and market information, thus limiting \nwomen\u2019s economic empowerment and in turn exacerbat-\ning the vulnerability of women to climate change as well as \nhindering the wellbeing and livelihoods of the households. \nGender roles and division of labor \nWomen and men have different roles within the \nhousehold and community in Doyogena. Women's roles \nfocus on three domains of work: productive, reproductive \nand community activities. Men's roles are limited to the \nproductive and community activities, and they hardly play \na visible role in reproductive activities.   \nThe extra burden on women results in a lack of time for \nwomen to engage in more profitable businesses and \nopportunities to educate and empower themselves.  \nIn addition, the impacts of climate change add an extra \nburden to women\u2019s provisioning roles. Women are the \nprimary providers of water and feed for the family and \nlivestock. Climate-related water and feed shortages put \nan increased burden on women as they have to travel a \nlonger distance in search of water and livestock feed.  \nWomen\u2019s roles are also limited when it comes to climate \nchange adaptation and resilience due to a lack of \ninformation and targeted capacity building support. Rural \nhouseholds lack labor and energy saving technologies \nsupport to reduce the extra work burden and free up \nadditional time to engage in more productive activities. \nWomen in decision-making \nDiscussions with women on separate FGDs and sector \noffice representatives indicate that most of the household \ndecisions are made by men. Women make decisions \nrelated to acquisition (purchase) or sale of small items \nwith low economic value, similar to the findings related to \naccess to and control over productive assets. \nOn the contrary, results from the FGDs with men indicate \nthat most of the decisions at the household level are \nmade jointly (by women and men). These include \ndecisions on which crops to grow for home consumption, \nwhich products to take to the market, whether to engage \nin non-farm business activity and purchase of clothes. \nDecisions related to daily household expenditures on \nfood, sales and use of income from minor goods like milk, \neggs and poultry, are often made by the women. \nDecisions on the type of crops to grow for sale and the \ntype of inputs (e.g. fertilizers) to use for agricultural \nproduction and use of income from sales of livestock are \nmade by men only. \nThe findings show that the differences in decision-making \nbetween women and men are linked to access and \ncontrol over productive resources. For example, women \nmake decisions over those resources which are under \ntheir control and so do men. Women's limited decision-\nmaking power is attributed to cultural norms (assuming \nmale superiority over women) that put women in a \nsubordinate position to men.  \nAccording to different data sources, the barriers to full \nparticipation of women and girls in decision-making \nprocesses include:  \n\u25fc Women's limited education, awareness, and \ninformation (about their rights, how to access and \nutilize services available in the locality); \n\u25fc Negative self-perception of women towards \nthemselves; \n\u25fc Societal attitude (lack of will of husband, societal \nperception towards women's workload and women's \ndecision-making and leadership capacity); \n\u25fc Long processes in public service affecting women\u2019s \nservice seeking behavior;  \n\u25fc Gender-based violence (GBV) or restriction in \nmovement \u2013 especially fear of rape, abduction and \nverbal harassment. \nConclusions and policy implications \nThe adverse impacts of climate change are felt the most \nby the poorest and marginalized groups of a community. \nDue to existing social inequalities, women carry the \nheaviest burdens associated with climate change and \nrelated risks. Even though women have unique \nknowledge and skills to help make an effective response \nto climate change, often they are left out of such \nconversations.  \nThe study indicated that women face multifaceted and \ninterlinked social problems including access and control \nover productive assets and access to services limiting \ntheir adaptive capacity to climate change.  \nAssessing the needs, affirmatively targeting women and \ngirls, strategically addressing identified problems with \nwomen endorsed interventions and engaging male \ncounterparts in the process can be a good point of entry \nto multidimensional gender inequality and societal issues.   \nAt the policy level, the country needs to develop and \nimplement policies and women\u2019s economic empowerment \nstrategies that: \n\u25fc Work towards attitude and behavior change as well \nas gender sensitization of communities; \n\u25fc Enable women to have access to better livelihood \nopportunities;  \n C C A F S  I N F O  N O T E  4  \n \n  \n\u25fc Organize and support existing women\u2019s saving and \ncredit associations and provide revolving funds to \nsolve the problems of women\u2019s access to finance and \ncredit; \n\u25fc Support expansion of women\u2019s existing businesses \nand engage women in new income generating \nactivities/businesses;  \n\u25fc Promote adult literacy and capacity building programs \nfor women; \n\u25fc Work towards building the self-confidence of women \nthrough training and experience sharing; \n\u25fc Introduce and scale labor and energy saving CSA \npractices for the active engagement of women on \nproductivity.   \nFurther Reading \n\u25fc DeVoe WD, DiLanzo T, Deliver W, Dunn L, Iversen K, \nMalter J, Russo S. 2018.

There are low \nwater levels in most dams, and increased uncertainty about future rainfall. As a result \nmanagement of the ecosystems in the basin that depend on river flows involves some \nhard decisions about what assets to save and what assets to let go. This paper models \nthis triage problem using a stochastic and dynamic programming approach. This \nmodel is used to identify how optimal management is affected by hysteretic and \nirreversible effects of drought on ecosystem assets and uncertainty about future \nclimate. \n \nKey Words: Triage, irreversibility, climate change. \n \n1  Introduction \nThis paper looks at the problem of allocating environmental water among \ndifferent ecosystems during a drought. The key feature of this problem is that failure \nto allocate adequate water to a particular ecosystem may result in irreversible or \nhysteretic changes in the nature of ecosystem such as the death of key populations of \nsome species. This problem is applicable to a range of environmental flow decisions \nin the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) and at several scales. For example the Murray-\nDarling Basin Commission\u2019s living Murray program identified six \u201cIcon sites\u201d as the \nfocus of its environmental water management strategy, and is currently exploring \noptions for how to provide water to maintain the health of these sites.  \nThe aim of this paper is to develop an understanding of optimal management \nstrategies of environmental water during drought. We calculate optimal water \nmanagement decision rules for a simple model and compare optimal management to a \ndecision rule that aims to keep as many ecosystems alive for as long as possible by \nalways providing water to an ecosystem that would otherwise die. The analysis \ntherefore focuses on the value of a strategy that deliberately does not provide water to Environmental triage during drought    AARES 2009 \n2 \nsome ecosystems that need it in order to store water for future use. The problem \ntherefore has a useful analogy to medical triage problems. \nTriage \nTriage means to sort. The concept of triage has been applied to biodiversity \nconservation (Bottrill et al, 2008; McDonald-Madden et al, 2008). In this context the \nbasic triage problem involves ranking individuals so that a fixed amount of \nconservation resources can be allocated to where they are of most benefit. As such the \nconcept does not differ from the standard economic problem of choice under scarcity. \nHowever we use the concept here because we are interested in the military triage \ncategory called expectant. Expectant are those expected to die, and refers to the \ncritically wounded for which there is no effective treatment, or the probability of \neffective treatment is very low.  \nA simple model using a military casualty example illustrates the triage concept \nand the expectant category. Define a condition score for casualties (c) that varies from \nzero to one with one being perfect health. The condition score provides two pieces of \ninformation: \n1.  The probability that the patient will survive without treatment. \n2.  The probability that treatment will be successful \nSuppose that the probability that a patient will die without treatment is \nproportional to the condition score. Also suppose that the probability that treatment is \nsuccessful in saving a patient who would have died is proportional to the health of the \npatient. If the value of treatment is the increase in probability of survival given \ntreatment, then this is proportional to ( )c c   1- , that is the probability that the patient is \ndying times the probability that the treatment will work. If there are is a fixed amount \nof resources for treatment, and each treatment takes the same amount of resources \n(simplifications from many actual triage procedures) then the triage decision involves \nclassifying patients into three categories as illustrated in Figure 1. Environmental triage during drought    AARES 2009 \n3 \nThis model provides a simple illustration of how the triage expectant category \nrelates to the problem of optimal allocation of scare resources. \nNature of the problem \nThe problem of interest here differs from the static triage problem described \nabove in two regards. First the scarce resource, water, may be allocated to future time \nperiods as well as to current use. Second, the benefits from providing water to any \necosystem will depend on the future supply of water to an ecosystem and it\u2019s \nsubsequent prospects for survival. Managing water is also inherently a problem of \ndecision making under uncertainty. This uncertainty is exacerbated by climate change, \nwhich reduced the value of complex formal modelling of decisions under uncertainty \nthat rely of historical data to provide information about probability distributions. \nUncertainty also exists about the nature of the ecological response to water. This \nuncertainty may be partially reducible by investment in research, however uncertainty \nis likely to remain due to the complexity of the ecosystems, the existence of other \nthreats and stresses, and a history of flow regimes that have been altered from their \nnatural state by dams and irrigation. Uncertainty may also exist about the probability \nthat an ecosystem will cross an important threshold, the likely state and behaviour of \n0\n0.3\n0 1\nPatient Condition\nV\na\nl\nu\ne\n \no\nf\n \nT\nr\ne\na\nt\nm\ne\nn\nt\nE\nx\np\ne\nc\nt\na\nn\nt\nTreat\n\u201c\nW\na\nl\nk\ni\nn\ng\n \nW\no\nu\nn\nd\ne\nd\n\u201d\nTreatment \nResources\n0\n0.3\n0 1\nPatient Condition\nV\na\nl\nu\ne\n \no\nf\n \nT\nr\ne\na\nt\nm\ne\nn\nt\nE\nx\np\ne\nc\nt\na\nn\nt\nTreat\n\u201c\nW\na\nl\nk\ni\nn\ng\n \nW\no\nu\nn\nd\ne\nd\n\u201d\nTreatment \nResources\nFigure 1. An example of triage and the expectant classification Environmental triage during drought    AARES 2009 \n4 \nthe systems once it has crossed a threshold, such as the loss of a key species, and the \nvalues that people are likely to ascribe to the new system.  \nAnother aspect of the problem is that allocation of water to ecosystems tends \nto involve lumpy decisions, as minimum river-flow rates are often required before an \narea can be flooded (however technologies such as pumping are also being used to \ndeliver water more effectively). In some circumstances synergies between different \necosystems exist as they may depend of similar flow regimes. \nAnalytical approach \nWe use stochastic, dynamic programming (SDP) to analyse a simple stylized \nmodel of the environmental water management problem in order to understand the \ncharacteristics of optimal management. The model has a single dam that is used only \nto provide water to two ecosystems (A and B). Each ecosystem has a level of health \nthat, without water declines from full health to death in a specified number of years. \nWater can be allocated to neither, either or both ecosystems in each year. Each \necosystem requires a fixed, separate amount of water. Watering results in the \necosystem recovering to full health. We ignore uncertainty related to the ecosystem \nresponse for now and focus on uncertainty about future rainfall.  \nIn order to understand the nature of optimal management of this system, we \nfirst look at how optimal management is affected by the presence of thresholds. We \ndo this by comparing optimal management under two scenarios, first where an \necosystem dies if its health level reaches zero, and a second where the health of the \nsystem can recover once it reaches zero. We focus on how the probability of a rainfall \nevent affects these results, as this is one way in which climate change may affect the \nsystem. The questions addressed are: \na) Do circumstances exist where optimal management involves abandoning \nsome ecosystems before absolutely necessary? \nb) How does the (lack of) ability of an ecosystem to recover from zero health \naffect the optimal decision rule? \nWe focus on the decision about the use of water when storage levels are low, \nbut still sufficient to provide water to both ecosystems in the current year. We confirm \nthat circumstances may exist where it is valuable to classify some ecosystems as Environmental triage during drought    AARES 2009 \n5 \n\u201cexpectant\u201d and withhold water from them. In the case examined, this result does not \nhold for the system where recovery is possible. This suggesting that a threshold for \nirreversible change is important in determining the value of the expectant triage \napproach. \nA second section uses simulation modelling to explore the value of the \nexpectant triage approach in situations where water storage levels are low. We \ncompare a triage decision rule, which lets one ecosystem die in the first year, with a \ndecision rule that always waters an ecosystem when it is required to stay alive. We \nask \u201cunder what rainfall patterns in the triage decision rule valuable?\u201d and examine \nhow the probability of different environmental outcomes changes under the two \ndecision rules. \n2  Overview of the Model \nThe model specifies state variable defining the amount of water in the dam, \nand the health of each of two ecosystems (A and B). The dam level is increase by an \namount of runoff from random rain event  t r  that can occur one per year with \nprobability p. The dam level is decreased by water released to ecosystems (\nb\nt\na\nt w w , ). \nThe amount of water allocated to an ecosystem can take one of two values: \ni i\nt w w or    0 ,= . Therefore the amount of water in storage at the beginning of year t is \ngiven by: \n( )\nb\nt\na\nt t t t w w r w w w 1 1 1 1 max, min - - - - - - + = . \nThe capacity of the dam ( max w ) is set to be relatively high, (greater than the \nmaximum annual rainfall) so that loss of water by overflow is not a major \nconsideration for water use at low water storage levels.  The rain event is assumed to \noccur after the release of environmental flows so the constraint imposed on the water \ndecision by the amount of water available each year is: \nb\nt\na\nt t w w w + \u00b3  \nThe health of the ecosystems (\nb\nt\na\nt h h , ) is defined as an index [0,1] that declines \nby an amount  b a i i , , = b ; for each year that it is not watered, returning to one if it is Environmental triage during drought    AARES 2009 \n6 \nwatered but remaining at zero if it reaches zero. That is the equation of describing the \nchange in the health of each ecosystem is: \n( )\n0 , 0 1\n0 , 0 , 0 max\n0 0\n1 1\n1 1 1\n1\n> >\n> = -\n=\n=\n- -\n- - -\n-\ni\nt\ni\nt\ni\nt\ni\nt i\ni\nt\ni\nt\ni\nt\nh w\nh w h\nh\nh b  \nThe objective function is assumed to be to maximise society\u2019s direct utility \nfrom the ecosystems over time. This is assumed to be of the form: \n( ) ( ) \u2211\n\u00a5\n=\n- + + =\n1\n1\nt\nb\nt b\na\nt a\nt\nw\nh h r Max V\ni\nt\na a  \nWhere r is the discount rate. This objective function is maximized subject to \nthe equations of motion for water levels and ecosystem health defined above. The \nproblem was solved using stochastic dynamic programming (Bellman, 1957) using \ncode developed by Miranda and Fackler (2002). The solution provides the expected \nvalue of problem, the optimal decision, and the probability transition matrix given the \noptimal decision for each specified combination of values for the state variables. \nSince the equilibrium solution to the model degenerates to the health of both \necosystems being zero, that is eventually the threshold will be crossed, we explore the \nlong run properties of the solution by simulating multiple runs (80 iterations) of a long \ntime horizon (60 years), and report average values across all runs at t=60 for variables \nof interest. \nA simulation model was programmed in Microsoft Excel\u00ae in order to explore \nthe implications of different decisions rules for the probability of survival of the two \necosystems.  \nFor both models we specify the parameters of the problem so that ecosystem \nA is typically conserved and ecosystem B is possibly sacrificed under a triage \nmanagement system. In the base case the model parameters are specified so that both \necosystems have the same characteristics, ( 2 = =\nb\nt\na\nt w w , 2 . 0 = = b a b b ) but \necosystem A is valued twice as highly as ecosystem B ( 10 , 20 = = b a a a ). A discount \nrate of 1% is assumed, consistent with a focus on future value in the conservation of \necosystems. The dam capacity is set to 15 units. Environmental triage during drought    AARES 2009 \n7 \n3  Results \nWe focus on the problem of decision making under a drought, that is when \nwater storage levels are low, and the health of the ecosystems are also likely to be \nlow. Figure 2 show select results from the model run under optimal management. It \nreports average values after 60 years for ecosystem health and dam levels for 80 \nsimulation runs under optimal management and favourable starting conditions (health \nand water level starting values equal to 50% of maximum values). Results are shown \nfor a range of scenarios that vary the annual probability of a rainfall event from 0 to \n0.85. Figure 2 also show the excess water: this is the average expected annual rain fall \nminus the average annual water requirements of both ecosystems. (These values are \nreported on the right hand side axis, and this second Y-axis is truncated at zero, \nhowever values at rainfall probabilities less than 0.2 the excess water figure is \nnegative, reflecting the fact that on average there is not enough rainfall to meet the \nneeds of both ecosystems. \n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\nProbability of Rain Event\nH\ne\na\nl\nt\nh\n \no\nf\n \nE\nc\no\ns\ny\ns\nt\ne\nm\ns\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\nW\na\nt\ne\nr\nEcosystem A Health Ecosystem B Health\nWater storage (RH scale) Excess water (RH scale)\nWater Eco B (RH Scale)\n \nFigure 2.

However as the \nprobability of rain and the expected rainfall decreases, a decision is made to not \nsupply water to the less valuable ecosystem (B). This occurs where the expected level \nof rainfall is still sufficient to provide water to both ecosystems. That is where the \nmeasure of excess water is still positive. \n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\nProbability of Rain Event\nH\ne\na\nl\nt\nh\n \no\nf\n \nE\nc\no\ns\ny\ns\nt\ne\nm\ns\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n16\nW\na\nt\ne\nr\nEcosystem B Health REV Ecosystem B Health\nWater storage (RH scale) REV Water storage (RH scale)\n \nFigure 3. The average dam levels and expected health of ecosystem B with reversible (REV) and \nirreversible health thresholds at h=0. \nFigure 3 shows the same based model values for average dam levels and the \nhealth of ecosystem B as shown in Figure 2.

Output from this scenario, with \nreversible changes where health is zero are marked \u201cREV\u201d. We can see that when \nloses are not reversible, dams are run much more conservatively, that is they are keep \na higher level on average.  Environmental triage during drought    AARES 2009 \n9 \nThe irreversible threshold also results in the health of ecosystem B declining at \nhigher rainfall probabilities. This is a result of water not being applied to Ecosystem \nB. Optimal management of the system therefore involves withholding water from \necosystem B at higher rainfall probabilities (and expected rainfall values) when there \nis an irreversible threshold, than when the health of the ecosystem can readily recover.  \n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1\n0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200\nValue\nF\nr\ne\nq\nu\ne\nn\nc\ny\nExpectant\nSave All\n \nFigure 4 Distribution of present value under two management strategies. \nFigure 4 shows the distribution of present values that occurs when the \nsimulation model is run under two different management strategies. The initial value \nof the model runs specifies the grim situation where the \u201cexpectant\u201d tirage strategy \nwas shown to be useful by the SDP modelling. Specifically, just enough water is in \nstorage in the first year to allow water to be made available to both ecosystems, and \nboth ecosystems require water in that year in order to survive. The \u201cSave All\u201d \nmanagement strategy is to provide water, where possible to both ecosystems when it \nis required to prevent death. The \u201cExpectant\u201d management strategy deliberately \nprovides no water to ecosystem B in the first year, ensuring that it dies. This ensures \nmore water is available to try and maintain ecosystem A in subsequent years. After \nthe first year the \u201cExpectant\u201d strategy uses the same strategy as \u201cSave All\u201d of only \nproviding water when it is required to keep Ecosystem A alive. Figure 4 shows the Environmental triage during drought    AARES 2009 \n10 \nbimodal nature of the distribution of outcomes under each strategy.  The large peak at \n600 under the \u201cExpectant\u201d strategy represents the situation where Ecosystem A \nsurvives the drought, and dam levels can be maintained at high enough levels in the \nfuture to ensure its survival. The smaller peak at a value of 100 reflects the situation \nwhere Ecosystem A does not survive the drought. This peak is higher under the \u201cSave \nAll\u201d strategy, reflecting the fact that water applied to Ecosystem B reduces the \nchanges of Ecosystem A surviving. Conversely, the \u201cSave All\u201d strategy has a \nprobability peak at 1200, reflecting the situations where enough rain fell in the early \nyears to save both ecosystems, and small positive values between 600 and 1200 \nreflecting situations where ecosystem B survived the initial drought but had to be \nabandoned in later more prolonged droughts.  \nThe bimodal nature of the distribution is hidden in the SDP analysis by a focus \non expected values. Given this bimodal distribution, information on how the different \ndecisions affect the probability of the different outcomes may be more useful than \ninformation on the expected values. In Figure 5 we present this information as the \nprobability of achieving a benefit and the probability of incurring a cost from using \nthe \u201cExpectant\u201d decision rule as compared to the \u201cSave All\u201d decision rule. \nThe possible benefit of the expectant strategy is the increased chance of saving \nEcosystem A in the future due to holding more water in reserve. This is calculated as \nthe probability of death of Ecosystem A in the first 20 years of the model run under \nthe \u201cSave all\u2019 management strategy, minus the same probability under the \n\u201cExpectant\u201d management strategy. The possible cost of the Expectant management \nstrategy is the forgone opportunity to save Ecosystem B. The probability of incurring \nthis cost is the probability that Ecosystem B will survive under the \u201cSave all\u201d \nmanagement strategy. Figure 5 shows how the probability of incurring these benefits \nand costs are affected by the chance of rainfall. \nChoosing between the two strategies based on the information presented in \nFigure 5 requires weighting the value of each ecosystem and relative probability of \neach outcome. If the ecosystems are given equal weighting, then the decision to use \nthe Expectant management strategy can be based on if the probability of the benefit is \ngreater than the probability of the cost. We can see for the example in Figure 5, that \nunder these circumstance the Expectant strategy would only be optimal for rainfall Environmental triage during drought    AARES 2009 \n11 \nprobability levels where, on average there is not enough rainfall to provide water for \nboth ecosystems. \n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1\n0.0125 0.0625 0.1125 0.1625 0.2125 0.2625 0.3125 0.3625\nAnnual Probability of a Rain Event\nP\nr\no\nb\na\nb\ni\nl\ni\nt\ny\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n3.5\nE\nx\nc\ne\ns\ns\n \nW\na\nt\ne\nr\nIncrease P of Saving A  Increase P of losing B excess water (% required RH axis)\n \nFigure 5 Probability (P) of Cost and Benefits of Triage with Medium Size Rain Events (rn=8) \nThis result is however not universal. Figure 6 shows equivalent results for the \ncase where the rainfall event is larger (rn=16). In this case there is a range of rainfall \nprobabilities, where average rainfall is sufficient to provide for average water needs \n(approximately 0.0625-0.1125) where the Expectant management strategy is optimal. \nA range of factors determine the shape of the curve describing the probability \nof achieving a benefit by using the Expectant triage decision. One point to note is that \nthe benefit is still relatively large at medium rainfall probabilities. In other words in \ntrying to save critical ecosystems, the \u201cSave all\u201d strategy, by running down dam \nlevels can imposes a significant, and reducible, risk on the future survival of \necosystem A. \nOn the other hand the probability of ecosystem B surviving under the \u201cSave \nall\u201d strategy increases rapidly with the probability of rainfall. The result in figure 6 \ntherefore indicates that the optimal choice is sensitive to the probability of rainfall.

First we ask, if, when water stores are low- but \nsufficient to provide all water needs in that year, it can be optimal to deliberately let \nsome ecosystems die in order to save water for future years. The analysis confirms \nthat this strategy, analogous to the triage practice of classifying severely sick \ncasualties as expectant, can be optimal, in the sense of maximizing expected value. \nThis can be the case even when we expect there to be enough rainfall, on average, to \nmaintain all ecosystems. Next we show that this result can be attributed to the \nexistence of a threshold, that is the potential death of an ecosystem that does not \nreceive water. Environmental triage during drought    AARES 2009 \n13 \nA notable result is that if assets that are dependent on water storage can suffer \nirreversible change then management of water storage should be very conservative. \nThat is, optimal management implies that large water stores are maintained, even \nwhen the system is under significant stress. \nThe focus of dynamic programming on the expected value of the outcome \nhowever hides the bimodal distribution of outcomes and the nature of the trade-off \ninvolved. Both the decision to let an ecosystem die, and the decision to save it can \nlead to large regrets depending on how future rainfall events unfold. The decision not \nto save an ecosystem may be regretted if there is significant rain that follows. \nAlternatively deciding to run down water storage to save all ecosystems risks not \nhaving enough water in future years to save any ecosystems if future rainfall turns out \nto be unfavourable. \nWe present results from a simulation model to help develop an understanding \nof how the probability of these different outcomes is affected by different \nmanagement strategies. Preliminary results indicate that the optimal choice of a \nmanagement strategy is not clear cut. Specifically the probability that an ecosystem \nthat we save today will survive into the future is very sensitive to the probability of \nrainfall. Depending on the rainfall probability both the costs and the benefits of the \nExpectant triage decision can be large. More work is required to see how sensitive \nthis result is to other factors, such as the rate of decline of ecosystem health, the \nrelative water requirements, and other real world complexities such as synergies in \napplying water to both ecosystems.  \n \nApplications and future work. \nThis work is designed to be applied in two ways. First we hope to improve the \nintuition of river managers about the merits of triage decisions, and the associated \nimplications for managing water storage levels. Future work will focus on the value of \ncarry-over water, and look to see if triage rules are valuable and robust across the \nrange of future rainfall patterns that may occur under climate change. \nThe second domain for application of this work is in our future work using \nagent-based simulation models to explore the trade-offs between irrigated agricultural \nproduction and environmental outcomes at the basin scale. Agent based modelling has Environmental triage during drought    AARES 2009 \n14 \nthe potential to identify opportunities for improved management of the system, while \ntaking into account the behaviour of producers and environmental managers. The \npresent work will enable us to specify simple decision rules for environmental \nmanagement that take account of the need to keep the ecological system away from \ncritical thresholds. Similar thresholds exist in the irrigation industry, where lack of \nwater can cause the death or permanent reduction in the productivity of perennial \ncrops. This simplification of the human decision making problem in the presence of \nthresholds will therefore help make modelling of trade-offs and policy responses in \nthis complex human-ecological system tractable. \n5  References \nBellman, R.E., (1957) Dynamic Programming, Princeton University Press, Princeton, \nNJ. \nBottrill, M.C., L.N.

For the poor in particular, the detrimental ef-\nfects of climate change on the environment erode a broad set of \nlivelihood assets\u2014natural, physical, financial, human, social, \nand cultural. The resilience of the poor to disaster is already \nlow. Many depend directly on fragile natural resources for their \nlivelihoods and well-being, and many live in environmentally \nfragile areas that are especially prone to natural hazards such as \ndrought, floods, rising sea levels, and landslides. When circum-\nstances change for the worse, the poor are hard put to adapt. For \nmany, the effects of climate change are compounded by other \npressures, including a growing scarcity of land viable for agri-\nculture, joblessness, difficulty obtaining enough food, poor \nhealth, lack of education, social marginalization, and lack of ac-\ncess to credit and insurance. Although livelihoods have con-\nstantly adapted to change throughout history, it is very likely \nthat the impacts of climate variability and change will push \npoor people beyond their capacity to cope. It is a fact that many \nindigenous peoples in LAC have already reached this point \n(Kronik and Verner 2010).\nThe progression of cause and effect sketched in figure 1 \nshows how GHG emissions resulting from human activity are \nlinked to their environmental impacts (step 1). This environ-\nmental degradation affects the availability and quality of wa-\nter for human consumption (including domestic, agricultur-\nal, and industrial use and power generation), as well as \nterrestrial and marine flora and fauna ecosystems. The envi-\nronmental impacts have social implications, as presented in \nstep 2, affecting people\u2019s livelihoods, food security, and health. \nExcessive stress on those determinants of human well-being \nClimate change is the defining development challenge of our time. More than a global environmental issue, climate change is \nalso a threat to poverty reduction and economic growth and may unravel many of the development gains made in recent \ndecades. Latin America and the Caribbean account for a relatively modest 12 percent of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas (GHG) \nemissions,1 but communities across the region are already suffering adverse consequences from climate change and variabil-\nity (De la Torre, Fajnzylber, and Nash 2009). As highlighted in \u201cReducing Poverty, Protecting Livelihoods, and Building \nAssets in a Changing Climate\u201d (Verner 2010), climate change is likely to have unprecedented social, economic, environmen-\ntal, and political repercussions. 2  POVERTY REDUCTION AND ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT (PREM) NETWORK     www.worldbank.org/economicpremise\nwill increase poverty and income inequality. It may also cause \nmigration to swell and has the potential to heighten the risk of \nconflict. \nTo understand the social implications of climate variabili-\nty and change, it is useful to identify risk factors and protec-\ntive factors. Although not necessarily causal, these factors can \nbe important predictors, and understanding them can help \nshape policies and programs to strengthen people\u2019s resilience \nand capacity to adapt. Risk or vulnerability factors increase \nthe likelihood that a person or community will experience \nnegative outcomes: experience shows that the risks associated \nwith climate change increase when combined with poverty, \npoor governance, and poorly maintained infrastructure. How \nvulnerable people are to these risks often depends on local so-\ncial, political, and economic realities and government poli-\ncies. \nProtective factors increase the likelihood that a person or \ncommunity will make a successful transition.

Overall, like the world as a \nwhole, the LAC region is projected to warm. Most of \nSouth America is forecast to warm more than the global \naverage, the exception being the Southern Cone. This im-\nplies that, over most of the region, temperatures in all sea-\nsons will continue to rise during the 21st century. Heat \nwaves are likely to be more frequent and more intense, and \nthe higher temperature level in general will tend to favor a \nlonger warm season, with possible related extreme events \nsuch as hurricanes. In the high Andes, the temperature \nrise is projected to be greater than the mean values for the \nregion. This means that less water will be stored because \nsnow, ice, and glaciers will continue melting.

The patterns of probable change \nshow dry areas becoming dryer and wet areas becoming \nwetter.2 Mean annual precipitation is projected to decrease \nover northern South America near the Caribbean coasts, \nas well as over large parts of northern Brazil, Chile and Pa-\ntagonia, and to increase in Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, \naround the equator, and in southeastern South America. \nThe mid-continental areas, such as the inner Amazon and \nnorthern Mexico, are projected to become dryer during \nthe summer months, with increased risk of droughts and \nforest fires. Annual precipitation is likely to decrease in the \nsouthern Andes, with relative changes being largest in \nsummer. How annual and seasonal mean rainfall will \nchange over northern South America, including the Ama-\nzon forest, is uncertain. \n\u2022\t Extreme events. Most areas of LAC have experienced several \ninstances of severe weather in recent decades, with torren-\ntial rain and hurricanes causing thousands of deaths and \ndamaging properties, infrastructure, and natural resourc-\nes. These events are widely interpreted as reflecting cli-\nmate change and increased variability, but no formal scien-\ntific detection of such a relationship at the regional level \nhas been made.3 Neither is there evidence that the recent \nextreme events are less or more severe than those that may \nbe experienced in the future. That said, the available mod-\nels clearly suggest that the changes that will take place over \nthis century will generally be in the more extreme direc-\ntion, that is, more intensive precipitation, longer dry spells \nand warm spells, heat waves with higher temperatures \nthan generally experienced up to now, and more numer-\nous, severe hurricanes. According to the International \nPanel on Climate Change (IPCC 2007a), further increases \nare expected in the number of floods and droughts and in \nthe intensity of tropical cyclones (see figure 2). \nThe countries in the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico, \nwhich are often assailed by intense hurricanes, can expect these \nstorms to become even fiercer as a result of climate change. \nOther important issues are the destruction of coral reefs and \nthe growing threat to southeast Pacific fish stocks due to in-\ncreasing sea surface temperatures. A rise in sea level would \nlikely bring flooding to low-lying regions such as the coasts of El \nSalvador and Guyana and could exacerbate social and political \ntensions in the region. \nFor the Andean countries, the most momentous climate ef-\nfects include major warming, changes in rainfall pattern, rapid \ntropical glacier retreat, and impacts on mountain wetlands. \nThese effects will combine with increasing precipitation vari-\nability to significantly affect water availability (IPCC 2007c). \nThese effects may lead to greater migration and risk of conflicts. \nIn the Amazon region, the most pressing issue is the risk \nthat the forest will die back\u2014that rising temperatures and de-\ncreases in soil moisture in the eastern Amazon region will lead \nto the replacement of tropical forest by savannah. When that \ndanger is combined with the deforestation caused by human \nFigure 2: Key Climate Change Hot Spots for Latin America\nSource: Verner (2010) based on IPCC (2007b).\n \ncoral reefs and mangroves seriously threatened with \nwarmer SST\nunder the worst seal-level rise scenario, mangroves are very \nlikely to disappear from low-lying coastlines\nAmazonia: loss of 43% of 69 tree species by the end of 21st\ncentury; savannization of eastern Amazonia\nCerrados: losses of 24% of 138 tree species for a temperature\nincrease of 2\u00b0C\nreduction of suitable lands for coffee\nincreases in aridity and scarcity of water resources\nsharp increase in extinction of: mammals, birds, butterflies, \nfrogs, and reptiles by 2050\nwater availability and hydroelectric generation seriously\nreduced due to reduction in glaciers\nOzone depletion and skin cancer\nsevere land degradation and desertification\nRio de la Plata coasts threatened by increasing storm surges\nand sea-level rise\nincreased vulnerability to extreme events\nNote: Areas in red correspond to sites where biodiversity is\ncurrently severely threatened and this trend is very likely to continue.4  POVERTY REDUCTION AND ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT (PREM) NETWORK     www.worldbank.org/economicpremise\nactivities, the outlook is dire. If present deforestation trends \ncontinue, 30 percent of the Amazonian forest will have disap-\npeared by 2050. That, with the transformation of tropical rain-\nforest into dry grassland savannah, would lead to the extinction \nof a great number of plant and animal species unique to the \narea.\nThe overall effects of climate change will be negative in the \nLAC region. There will, however, be exceptions, particularly \nwith respect to increasing temperatures. In the southernmost \npart of South America and in the Andes, rising temperatures \nwill expand the range of some crops, and the higher concentra-\ntion of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere will increase \nyields. But elsewhere, crops such as coffee and maize are already \nbeing grown in close-to-optimum temperatures, so temperature \nincreases, especially if coupled with declining rainfall, will lead \nto significant yield reductions. Higher temperatures not only \nwill affect plant growth, but will also cause more heat- and dis-\nease-related stress and mortality for livestock and humans alike. \nThe Road Ahead\nAlthough many of the effects of climate variability and change \nare already unavoidable, much scope remains for human agen-\ncy and ingenuity in crafting mitigation strategies to address the \ncauses of climate change itself and in adapting to address the \nconsequences.4 An optimal national strategy would employ \nboth mitigation and adaptation efforts and should embody \ngood governance and include public voice, representation, and \nsocial accountability.\nIt is critical that policy makers in LAC address the social is-\nsues related to climate change. Even if global mitigation efforts \nimprove, the climate trends that are already under way have \nconsiderable momentum and will dramatically affect econom-\nic, human, and social development for years to come. Thus, as \nthe Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change argues, it is \nparamount that climate variability and change become fully \nintegrated into development policy (Stern 2007). Social devel-\nopment is key to efforts to reduce the loss of livelihood systems, \nforced migration, and potential conflicts. Indeed, an overriding \nmessage that emerges from the study that this note describes is \nthat almost all of the policies, investments, and institutional \nreforms advocated here are good development policies. The re-\nalities of climate change may give them added value, but, in \nmost cases, they would have significant benefits even in its ab-\nsence. Thus, when devising adaptation policies, they should be \n\u201cclimate-proofed\u201d in the sense that they enhance resilience and \nenable adaptation. For example, physical infrastructure is in \ndire need of improvement, both to enhance people\u2019s living con-\nditions and economic opportunities and to enable people to \ncope with climate change. At-risk communities need special at-\ntention because risky climate situations are costly not just to \nthe households affected, but to society at large. Although this \nnote focuses on the external aspects of household and commu-\nnity transitions, climate change is also affecting the psychologi-\ncal transition\u2014a period of breaking free of traditional patterns \nof thinking and resolving problems, of increased competition \nover resources, and of emphasis on the present over the future. \nThe poor and vulnerable who live a day-to-day existence and \nlack the assets to allow long-term planning have little experi-\nence addressing these issues; they typically behave in ways that \nare rational for their objectives and perceptions of risk, which \nby necessity employ a very short-term perspective. Planning for \na future with a changing climate is extremely difficult when an \nindividual\u2019s or a household\u2019s asset base is barely sufficient to \nsurvive on from day to day, especially given frustrations that \narise from economic turbulence, blocked participation, and \nmarginalization in the community.\nAlthough fraught with risks, climate variability and change \nalso present opportunities for households, communities, local \nand national governments, society, and the economy. Decisions \nabout adaptation strategies, developing skills, and engaging \nwith the broader civic community will determine the quality \nof life for the next generation. With more knowledge about \nhow climate change affects the poor and vulnerable, govern-\nments may be better able to understand and serve this group. If \npolicy makers do not invest now in mitigation and adaptation, \nthey will miss a unique opportunity to equip the poor and vul-\nnerable populations with the tools to break the downward spi-\nral of poverty and inequality and become drivers of growth and \nsustainable development. \nAbout the Author\nDorte Verner is the Climate Change Coordinator in the Middle \nEast and North African Region of the World Bank.

To formally attribute change or occurrence of particular \nevents to a cause, a statistically sound number of events must \nnormally be considered. By nature, extreme events are rare at a \ngiven location. Events that occur over a large geographical re-\ngion, such as LAC, cannot simply be lumped together for study \nbecause the causal chains leading to them most likely differ \nfrom event to event and from location to location, which pre-\ncludes a simple statistical treatment of the data. Therefore, the \nrecent IPCC reports have very little to say about recent changes \nat a regional level, and even less about the national or provincial \nlevel, and their possible links with global climate variability and \nchange.\n4. The essence of mitigation policies should be to price carbon \nand carbon equivalent gases to reflect their true costs\u2014includ-\ning social costs. This note does not address these policies in any \ndetail. \nReferences\nDe la Torre, Augusto, Pablo Fajnzylber, and John Nash. 2009.

In December, \n192 countries will convene in Paris to finalize a climate agreement intended to keep global \ntemperature increases below two degrees Celsius. \nAn agreement will come at a critical time. International investment to mitigate climate change \nis far below levels needed to reach the two-degree target. The International Energy Agency \nestimates that an average of an additional $1 trillion in incremental financing for clean energy \nis needed to meet the temperature target1\u2014the \u201cClean Trillion.\u201d Currently, global clean energy \ninvestment levels are about 25 percent of what is needed: $321 billion in 2014.2\nInstitutional investors, and the corporations they invest in, are playing a growing role in \nfinancing the clean energy infrastructure needed to meet international climate goals. These \ninvestors and companies must support policymakers who seek an international agreement that \nwill provide clearer market signals and greater certainty for needed clean energy investments.\nIn September 2014, over 350 investors representing $24 trillion in assets issued the Global \nInvestor Statement on Climate Change, calling on governments to create an ambitious global \nagreement that includes a meaningful price on carbon.3 Climate change poses portfolio-\nwide risks to institutional investors, while the technologies and business models needed to \naddress climate change provide significant investment opportunities. Ceres has outlined \nrecommendations for institutional investors, the companies they invest in, and policymakers \nto achieve the needed new investment of $1 trillion annually in its 2014 report, Investing in the \nClean Trillion: Closing the Clean Energy Investment Gap.4 Ceres and our U.S. and international \ninvestor network partners also recently released a guide for asset owners, Climate Change \nInvestment Solutions,5 as well as a web-based platform for identifying and recording climate, \nclean energy and decarbonization investments and commitments.6\nThis paper connects the Clean Trillion goal to the current United States climate and clean energy \npolicy framework, which is a mixture of federal, state, and local initiatives. The paper outlines \nthe 2015 U.S. policy priorities of the Policy Working Group of the Investor Network on Climate \nRisk (INCR), a network of more than 110 institutional investors primarily based in the U.S., \nfocused on investment risks and opportunities associated with climate change. \nProtecting and scaling policies that help to bring institutional investors\u2019 capital into clean \nenergy will be key to achieving the pledge made by the United States to reduce emissions by 17 \npercent by 2020 and by 26-28 percent by 2025. Strong and credible U.S. targets will be key, in \nturn, to achieving an international agreement in Paris. With clear policy frameworks in place, \ninstitutional investors are poised to play a greater role in financing clean energy.\n1  International Energy Agency (IEA), Energy Technology Perspectives 2012: Pathways to a Clean Energy System, (Paris: OECD/IEA, 2012), 1, http://www.iea.\norg/etp/etp2012/\n2  Bloomberg New Energy Finance, \u201cClean Power Investment Declines 0.2% to $73.5 Billion,\u201d July 13th, 2015, http://about.bnef.com/bnef-news/clean-power-\ninvestment-slumps-28-in-quarter-amid-market-turmoil/ \n3  Investor Network on Climate Risk et al, Global Investor Statement on Climate Change, September 18th, 2014, http://investorsonclimatechange.org/\n4  Mark Fulton and Reid Capalino, Investing in the Clean Trillion: Closing the Clean Energy Investment Gap, Ceres, January 2014, www.ceres.org/issues/\nclean-trillion\n5  Investor Network on Climate Risk et al., Climate Change Investment Solutions Guide, April 22, 2015, http://bit.ly/1cONmOM.\n6  The Investor Platform for Climate Solutions, http://investorsonclimatechange.org. \n2     www.ceres.org\nAny policy framework that hopes to bring institutional investors\u2019 capital to financing clean \nenergy infrastructure should consider impacts across a diversified portfolio, since institutional \ninvestors typically invest broadly across asset classes and industries. Already, investors \n(including pension funds, mutual funds, and insurance companies) are investing in green bonds, \nnew instruments like YieldCos, private equity funds financing renewable energy projects, and a \nrange of companies producing or using clean energy services and products. \nSUMMARY OF U.S. POLICY PRIORITIES FOR 2015\nInstitutional investors are uniquely positioned to support the growth of a low-carbon economy, \nand we recommend that federal and sub-national policymakers support policies that enable the \nscaling-up of clean energy deployment that drives technology, business model, and financial \ninnovation.  Such policies should provide connections between needed clean energy technology \nin key sectors and the investment needs and portfolios of institutional investors in the United \nStates. To this end, INCR\u2019s key policy priorities for 2015 include:\nEnable clean energy scale and equity \n1) Provide stability for the federal production tax credit for wind, investment tax credit for \nsolar, and accelerated depreciation for renewable energy;\n2) Expand Master Limited Partnerships and Real Estate Investment Trusts to include \nrenewable energy; and\n3) Adopt city building benchmarking and disclosure ordinances that provide transparency on \nthe energy efficiency of the $800 billion Real Estate Investment Trust industry.\nEnable the evolution of the electric utility business model \n4) Maintain and expand state climate and clean energy standards (renewable energy, energy \nefficiency, AB32, RGGI, etc.);\n5) Develop robust final rules for the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Carbon Pollution \nStandards for new and existing power plants and ensure strong implementation by states \nthrough proven policies, such as renewable portfolio standards and energy efficiency \nresource standards; and\n6) Remove legal barriers that prevent companies and other electricity consumers from \nentering into third-party power purchase agreements with renewable energy developers.\nSupport the scaling of clean transportation technologies\n7) Support the adoption of rigorous federal fuel economy and GHG emission standards for \nheavy-duty trucks;\n8) Support the preservation of the Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency (CAFE)/GHG standards \nfor passenger vehicles and light trucks; and \n9) Adopt and expand state-level clean fuel standards.\nThis is a pragmatic and achievable agenda rather than a set of principles and ideal policy \noutcomes. Both the U.S. and international policy environments are falling short of the level \nof ambition needed to achieve the internationally adopted goal of limiting global temperature \nrise to no more than two degrees Celsius.7 Ultimately, a key goal of INCR, as noted in the \n7  Henry D. Jacoby and Y.-H. Henry Chen, Expectations for a New Climate Agreement, MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change, August \n2014, http://globalchange.mit.edu/files/document/MITJPSPGC_Rpt264.pdf \nAccelerating U.S. Clean Energy Deploymen: nvestor Policy Priorities     3\nGlobal Investor Statement, is a meaningful price on carbon in the U.S. and internationally. In \nthe interim there is much that can be achieved with the pragmatic agenda outlined above and \ndiscussed at further length in this paper. Part of the pragmatism of this agenda is a recognition \nof both the current partisan divide in the U.S. Congress and many state legislatures on climate \nand clean energy issues, and the current investment practices of U.S. institutional investors and \nthe limitations to \u2013 and opportunities for \u2013 greater investment in clean energy.\nENGAGING THE  WORLD\u2019S  L ARGE ST INVE STORS IN \nCLE AN ENERGY INVE STMENT REQUIRE S GRE ATER \nOPPORTUNIT IE S  ACROSS INVE STMENT PORTFOL IOS\nInstitutional investors manage a massive pool of capital that could be tapped to scale up clean \nenergy finance. Thus far, however, institutional investors have not been a leading source of \ncapital for clean energy. Pension funds and insurance companies only accounted for $22 \nbillion (or 2.5 percent) of clean energy asset finance globally from 2004-2011.8 This is despite \nestimates that institutional investors could invest $819 billion globally, even after accounting for \ndiversification, industry concentration limits, and other restrictions.9 \nCurrently, there are a limited number of clean energy investment vehicles available for \ninstitutional investors. Institutional investors typically invest for broad diversification across \nmultiple asset classes and primarily invest in publicly listed securities like stocks and bonds. \nIt is in this area where investment opportunities have been particularly lacking. Indeed, when \nappropriate investment vehicles \u2013 such as rated \u201cgreen\u201d bonds \u2013 have been available, they have \nbeen met with institutional investor demand that far exceeds supply.10\nA look at how institutional investors allocate their capital demonstrates the gap between \nthe capital needed for clean energy and the investment needs and practices of the investors. \nCurrently, renewable energy and energy efficiency infrastructure investment predominantly \ncomes from private capital sources. Wind farms, solar generators, and energy efficiency retrofits \nare typically financed through corporate balance sheets, bank loans, and other forms of private \nequity and debt. Institutional investors, however, only have limited exposure to the entire set of \nprivate equity asset classes. While U.S. pension funds may invest in private equity funds that in \nturn invest in renewable energy infrastructure, private equity generally constitutes a relatively \nsmall portion of a pension funds\u2019 investments, and clean energy is only a small portion of that \nallocation. Furthermore, diversification requirements often dictate that energy investments \nonly constitute a relatively small portion of those investments.  Pension funds in the United \nStates have, in aggregate, just 29 percent of their assets in private equity and other alternative \n8  Kaminker C. and F.

CPI estimates  $257 \nbillion available for direct project investments, which it then breaks down into $66 billion for project equity and $290 billion for project debt.

About 2 percent of assets are held as cash. The remaining 69 percent of a typical \nU.S. pension funds\u2019 assets are in public capital markets, primarily listed equities (stocks) and \nfixed-income (bonds).11 \nGiven the disconnect between current capital sources for clean energy and the asset allocations \nof institutional investors, any policy framework should consider the impacts of policy not only \non (1) direct investment by institutional investors, but also (2) semi-direct investment in \nfunds and new, publicly-traded-vehicles for infrastructure investment, as well as (3) indirect \ninvestment in clean energy infrastructure through corporations in which these investors \nare shareholders. Table 1 provides an overview of the spectrum of categories of investment \nopportunities.\nDIRECT INVESTMENT IN CLEAN ENERGY\nDirect investment in renewable energy infrastructure\nAmong U.S. pension funds, mutual funds, insurance companies and other large institutional \ninvestors, equity investment in wind farms, solar power plants, energy efficient buildings and \nretrofit projects and other clean energy infrastructure is limited. As mentioned above, these \ninvestors generally do not participate in equity or debt financing of individual projects, let alone \nenergy projects. However, while direct investment is constrained, it is nonetheless significant.\nThere has been some direct investment in renewable energy projects through project bonds. \nThese project bonds raise debt based on the revenues of a single project. In 2013, $3.1 billion \nof project bonds were issued, including over $1 billion just to finance Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s \nTopaz Solar project.12 While Bloomberg New Energy Finance predicts that such project bond \nfinancings could support $18-40 billion in annual project financing or refinancing by 2020,13 \nmost renewable energy projects are too small for project bond financing and require aggregation \nof numerous projects in order to be financed through bonds.\n11  Towers Watson, Global Pension Assets Study 2015, February 2015, 7, http://www.towerswatson.com/en/Insights/IC-Types/Survey-Research-\nResults/2015/02/Global-Pensions-Asset-Study-2015\n12  Bloomberg New Energy Finance, Green Bonds Market Outlook 2014, June 2 2014, 16, http://about.bnef.com/white-papers/green-bonds-market-\noutlook-2014/content/uploads/sites/4/2014/06/2014-06-02-Green-bonds-market-outlook-2014.pdf\n13  Bloomberg New Energy Finance, Green Bonds Market Outlook 2014\n69%\n29%\n2%\n44%\n25%\nFigure 1: Typical U.S. Pension Fund Asset Allocation\nPrivate Equity, \nDebt, & other \n Alternative \n Investments\n Cash\nPublic Equity\n Equity\n Bonds\nAccelerating U.S. Clean Energy Deploymen: nvestor Policy Priorities     5\nIn other parts of the world, institutional investors\u2014such as the Netherlands\u2019 AP4, \nPensionDanmark, various Australian Superannuation funds, and the insurance company \nMunich Re\u2014invest directly and substantially in clean energy projects. Research done by the \nClimate Policy Initiative suggests that more institutional investors, including those in the U.S., \ncould invest in renewable energy projects if they have enough scale to justify having a dedicated \nenergy project team. By their calculation, a pension fund with over $50 billion in assets has \nsufficient scale.14 The universe of investors of this scale, however, is relatively small. According \nto Towers Watson\u2019s most recent ranking of the world\u2019s largest pension funds, fewer than 30 \nfederal, state, and private pension funds in the U.S. have over $50 billion in assets.15 Especially \ngiven this limited universe of investors, any policy framework that hopes to scale renewable \nenergy investment by institutional investors must look beyond direct investment.\nDirect investment in energy efficiency through real estate holdings\nWhile it is rare for institutional investors to invest directly in energy generation projects, a \nnumber of U.S. institutional investors do own buildings directly. Through these buildings, \ninvestors have an opportunity to directly benefit from the financial returns associated with more \nenergy efficient buildings.\nEfficient buildings have consistently shown significant returns to property owners in terms of \nhigher rents, building value increases, and higher occupancy rates, which can lead to increased \nvalue for investors. McGraw Hill Construction has analyzed a range of financial benefits from \nimproving building efficiency. Among their findings: building values increase between 6 and 10 \npercent and rents rise by up to 6 percent.16 Another large study examined 10,000 buildings \n14  Climate Policy Initiative, 35\n15  Towers Watson, The World\u2019s 300 Largest Pension Funds- year end 2013, September 2014, http://www.towerswatson.com/en-US/Insights/IC-Types/Survey-\nResearch-Results/2014/09/The-worlds-300-largest-pension-funds-year-end-2013\n16  McGraw Hill Construction, Green Outlook 2011: Green Trends Driving Growth, November 2010, http://aiacc.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/\ngreenoutlook2011.pdf.

This study found that buildings \nwhich have earned Energy Star or LEED ratings \noutperform their peers on a number of metrics \nincluding per-square-foot rental rates that are 3 \npercent higher, overall rents that are 7 percent \nhigher, and selling prices that are 16 percent higher.21\nGiven the benefits of energy-efficient real estate, \ninvestors have been making properties they own \nmore efficient. The California Public Employees\u2019 \nRetirement System (CalPERS), which has a real \nestate portfolio of over $25 billion, worked with \ncore real estate investment managers to pursue a \n20 percent energy reduction. CalPERS exceeded \nits goal. The California State Teachers Retirement \nSystem (CalSTRS) has, since 2003, directed real \nestate managers for its separate accounts to assess \nbuilding sustainability annually. The result has been \na dramatic improvement of the energy performance \nratings of buildings in the portfolio. In 2007, less \nthan half (46 percent) of the buildings in CalSTRS\u2019s \nportfolio had an Energy Star score above 75; by 2014, \n86 percent of buildings achieved that rating. \nMost institutional investors in the United States, \nhowever, do not own buildings directly, just as \nthey do not directly invest in renewable energy \ninfrastructure. There is therefore a need for semi-\ndirect investment vehicles that can provide exposure \nto clean energy opportunities in renewable energy, \nefficient real estate, and beyond.\nCONNECTING INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS THROUGH SEMI-\nDIRECT INVESTMENTS IN INFRASTRUCTURE\nGiven the limitations to direct investment in clean \nenergy infrastructure, indirect investment options \nopen clean energy investment to a much broader \nuniverse of investors. New publicly-traded, semi-\ndirect investment vehicles are emerging to fill this \nneed. Such publicly traded vehicles are critical to \nattracting a broader universe of investors who need \nliquid investment opportunities, but want exposure \nto the attractive financial characteristics of clean \nenergy projects, including their typical stable cash-\nflows that come from long-term contracts with \nenergy offtakers.\n21  Eichholtz et al., Doing Well by Doing Good? Green Office Buildings, The American \nEconomic Review, December 2010\nGreen Bonds: Defining an \nEmerging Asset Class\nGreen bonds are a rapidly growing \nbut not clearly defined universe of \ninvestments. Pioneered by development \nbanks nearly a decade ago, green bonds \nhave grown dramatically. The market for \nlabeled green (or \u201cclimate\u201d) bonds has \nbeen estimated at $38 billion17 to a half-\ntrillion dollars ($502 billion)18 depending \non definition. These bonds include \nfinancing for traditional investments that \nhave the benefit of reducing greenhouse \ngas emissions, such as government \nbonds to finance public transportation. \nGreen bonds also encompass more \nnovel investments, such as corporate \nbonds that are \u201cring-fenced\u201d to finance \nclean energy projects or solar asset-\nbacked securities. Given the broad \nuniverse of green bonds, and the \nambiguity around their definition, Ceres \nconvened a number of large institutional \nbond purchasers to develop a set of \n\u201cinvestor expectations\u201d for green bonds. \nThese Investor Expectations build on, \nand complement, the 2014 Green Bond \nPrinciples developed by banks that \nstructure and sell bonds19 by addressing \nfour key areas that need greater \ndefinition and structure: 1) eligibility \ncriteria, 2) disclosure of use of proceeds, \n3) reporting on use of proceeds and \nimpacts, 4) independent assurance.20\n17  Bloomberg New Energy Finance, \u201cRebound in Clean Energy \nInvestment in 2014 Beats Expectations,\u201d January 9 2015, http://about.\nbnef.com/press-releases/rebound-clean-energy-investment-2014-beats-\nexpectations/ \n18  The Climate Bonds Initiative and HSBC, 2014, 3\n19  Bank of America, Citigroup, Credit Agricole, et al. \u201cGreen Bond \nPrinciples Created to Help Issuers and Investors Deploy Capital for \nGreen Projects,\u201d January 13, 2014, http://www.ceres.org/press/press-\nreleases/green-bond-principles-created-to-help-issuers-and-investors-\ndeploy-capital-for-green-projects \n20  Ceres, \u201cA Statement of Investor Expectations for the Green Bond \nMarket,\u201d February 10, 2015, http://www.ceres.org/files/investor-files/\nstatement-of-investor-expectations-for-green-bonds/at_download/file \nAccelerating U.S. Clean Energy Deploymen: nvestor Policy Priorities     7\nIndirect investments in renewable energy project equity and debt\nThe emerging equity option of choice for financing renewable energy projects is the YieldCo \nstructure. YieldCos are publicly traded corporate entities that provide some of the benefits of \ninvesting directly in electricity generation projects while providing the liquidity of a publicly \ntraded security. A number of YieldCos have been created just in the past two years, including \nPattern Energy (PEGI), NextEra Energy Partners (NEP), TerraForm Power (TERP), and NRG \nYield (NYLD).22 \nThough small in scale thus far, there are numerous debt instruments coming onto the market. \nThese investments in clean energy infrastructure debt are part of a burgeoning green/climate \nbond market (see sidebar, \u201cGreen Bonds: Defining an Emerging Asset Class\u201d). A portion of this \nfinancing is flowing to clean energy infrastructure through indirect investment vehicles, such \nas asset-backed securities. In 2013, Hannon Armstrong Sustainable Infrastructure issued $100 \nmillion in bonds backed by clean energy projects. SolarCity followed later in the year with an \nissuance of $54.4 million in bonds, and the company has subsequently sold bonds backed by \nadditional pools of solar projects.23 Expect to see additional clean energy bond issuances from \nmore issuers in the future.\nIndirect investments in energy efficiency retrofit financing\nIndirect financing opportunities remain limited for energy efficiency, trailing behind renewable \nenergy. This is despite the estimated $279 billion investment opportunity in retrofitting U.S. \nbuildings.24 Constraints on the institutional investment needed to realize this opportunity were \noutlined in Ceres\u2019 report, Power Factor: Institutional Investors\u2019 Policy Priorities Can Bring \nEnergy Efficiency to Scale.25 The key constraint is a lack of appropriate investment vehicles. \nSecuritization and other forms of indirect investment will be needed so that numerous small \nprojects can be aggregated for financing.\nThere have been a handful of energy efficiency securitizations, such as a $24.3 million issuance \nby the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA)26 and a \nprivate placement of bonds issued by Citi from Pennsylvania\u2019s Keystone HELP residential \nenergy efficiency retrofit program.27 Most notably, the Western Council of Governments\u2019 HERO \nprogram issued a rated bond, which was backed by property-assessed clean energy (PACE) loans \nmade to numerous homeowners in California. A number of others look to be on the horizon, \nwith Citi creating a $100 million credit facility28 to finance projects developed by Kilowatt \nFinancial, and Renewable Funding securing a $300 million credit facility to finance PACE-\nfinanced projects.29 Kilowatt Financial and Renewable Funding both ultimately seek to securitize \nthe loan portfolios financed by these funds.\n22 Giles Parkinson, \u201c$1 trillion solar, wind finance to outstrip oil and gas industry,\u201d RE New Economy, July 20, 2015,  http://reneweconomy.com.au/2015/1-\ntrillion-solar-wind-finance-to-outstrip-oil-and-gas-industry-63176\n23  Bloomberg New Energy Finance, Green Bonds Market Outlook 2014, June 5, 2014, http://about.bnef.com/white-papers/green-bonds-market-outlook-2014/\n24  DB Climate Change Advisors and The Rockefeller Foundation, United States Building Energy Efficiency Retrofits: Market Sizing and Financing Models, \nMarch 2012, http://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/\n25  Ceres, Power Factor: Institutional Investors\u2019 Policy Priorities Can Bring Renewable Energy to Scale, May 2013, available at: http://www.ceres.org/resources/\nreports/power-factor-institutional-investors2019-policy-priorities-can-bring-energy-efficiency-to-scale/view\n26  \u201cNYSERDA Issues Energy Efficiency Financing Bonds\u201d, Breaking Energy, August 23, 2013, http://breakingenergy.com/2013/08/23/nyserda-issues-energy-\nefficiency-financing-bonds/\n27  Anya Litvak, \u201cLooking for loans with an energy angle,\u201d Pittsburg Post-Gazette: Power Source Blog, October 6th, 2014, http://powersource.post-gazette.com/\npowersource/companies-powersource/2014/10/06/Looking-for-loans-with-an-energy-angle/stories/201410060217 \n28  Stephen Lacey, \u201cEnergy Efficiency is About to Get a $200M Jolt from Wall Street\u201d, Greentech Media, January 22, 2014, http://www.greentechmedia.com/\narticles/read/Energy-Efficiency-Is-About-to-Get-a-200M-Jolt-From-Wall-Street\n29  Jeff St. John, \u201cPACE on the Rebound: Renewable Funding Closing $300M Credit Facility,\u201d Greentech Media, May 9, 2014, http://www.greentechmedia.com/\narticles/read/pace-on-the-rebound-renewable-funding-closing-300m-credit-facility \nCase Study: Solar City Leverages Policy to Scale  \nand Reaches the Public Capital Markets\nSolarCity (SCTY) went public in December 2012, with an initial public offering on the NASDAQ \nstock exchange. However, its most interesting contribution to the public capital markets came in \nNovember 2013, when Solar City became the first company to issue bonds backed by revenues \nfrom the power purchase agreements they enter into with customers. The company issued a \nsecond round of bonds in March of 2014, and in October 2014, the company issued bonds that \nretail investors could purchase.\nLike other companies in the solar space, SolarCity structures power purchase agreements or leases \nwith customers that allow the customer to pay as little as $0 up front. It has done this by not only \ncreating an attractive financing option for customers, but also by monetizing incentives for solar, \nparticularly the investment tax credit and renewable electricity certificates that are associated \nwith renewable energy standards. It has also taken advantage of net-metering, which allows its \ncustomers to sell their excess electricity back onto the grid. \nSolarCity\u2019s success in bringing solar to the public capital markets brings new investment \nopportunities into asset classes accessible by a broad set of institutional (and now retail) investors. \nIts success also demonstrates how policy\u2014particularly the Investment Tax Credit, renewable \nportfolio standards, and net-metering\u2014scaled the industry to the point where cheaper sources \nof capital can now enter into the sector to drive down costs and contribute to the increasing \ncompetitiveness of renewable energy. Indeed, research suggests that securitization could further \nlower the cost of solar projects between 5 and 13 percent.30\n30  Theresa Alafita and Joshua Pearce, \u201cSecuritization of Residential Solar Photovoltaic Assets: Costs, Risks and Uncertainty,\u201d v, 67 (2014), 488-498, http://www.sciencedirect.\ncom/science/article/pii/S0301421513013098 \n8     www.ceres.org\nAccelerating U.S. Clean Energy Deploymen: nvestor Policy Priorities     9\nIndirect investments in advanced vehicles\nUnlike in renewable energy and energy efficiency financing, there has been a long history of \nsecuritizing loans for motor vehicles. Toyota was the first car company to modify this practice to \nenable clean vehicle investment. In March 2014, the company issued $1.75 billion of investment-\ngrade bonds backed on loans for hybrid and electric vehicles.31 It remains to be seen whether \nother car companies will follow Toyota\u2019s lead. However, new clean vehicle investments have \nbeen facilitated through indirect investments in car companies, like Tesla Motors, and other \npublicly traded companies that are building clean energy vehicles and infrastructure. Indeed, \nin transportation and beyond, indirect investment is likely to comprise institutional investors\u2019 \ngreatest exposure to clean energy investment opportunities.\nINDIRECT INVESTMENT IN CLEAN ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE\nThe broadest opportunity for institutional investors to finance clean energy infrastructure \nmay also be the least direct. As diversified investors, institutional investors hold equity in, \nand debt of, companies across sectors\u2014from utilities, to oil and gas companies, clean energy \ncompanies, auto manufacturers and suppliers, consumer goods companies and beyond. There \nis an opportunity to mobilize a tremendous amount of capital through the balance sheets and \noperating expenditures of corporations not otherwise invested in clean energy. There is also \nsignificant risk from companies failing to adequately mitigate the impacts of climate change.\nThose companies with the most shareholder value at risk are those with the most capital \ninvested in carbon intensive fuels and infrastructure. In September 2013, an international group \nof 75 institutional investors representing more than $4 trillion in assets launched the Carbon \nAsset Risk Initiative\u2014a coordinated effort to spur 45 of the world\u2019s largest fossil fuel companies \nto address the physical and financial risks posed by climate change. This effort builds on a strong \nhistory of U.S. institutional investors engaging with companies in their portfolios to improve \nperformance related to climate change mitigation. In 2014 alone, 148 shareholder resolutions \nrelated to climate change and sustainability were filed with U.S. companies, resulting in 66 \nagreements for corporate action requested by investors. And in 2015, additional shareholder \nresolutions already have resulted in overwhelming shareholder votes in support of climate risk \ndisclosure and actions by companies including BP, Shell and Statoil.\n31  Allison Bisbey, \u201cToyota Debuts Green Auto Bond,\u201d Asset Securitization Report, March 26, 2014, http://www.structuredfinancenews.com/\nissues/2014_4/-248702-1.html\nDESCRIPTION EXAMPLES\nYieldCos A publicly traded company that provides \nsome of the benefits of investing directly \nin electricity generation projects (e.g., \nstable cash flows) while providing the \nliquidity of a publicly-traded security\nTerraform Power (TERP)\nNextEra Energy Partners (NEP)\nNRG Yield (NYLD)\nPattern Energy Group (PEGI)\nAsset backed securities (ABS) A bond where the repayment of the bond \ncomes through cash flows from a set \nof loans or other revenue streams and \nthe rating of the bond is based on those \ncashflows rather the creditworthiness of \nthe issuer.\nSolar City issues bonds backed on solar \npower purchase agreements\nCalifornia HERO program issues property \nassessed clean energy (PACE) bond \nToyota issues bonds backed on hybrid \nand electric vehicles\nTable 2: Emerging Semi-Direct Investment Opportunities\n10     www.ceres.org\nEvidence already exists that improved investment returns can come from improved corporate \npractices related to climate risk. The nonprofit CDP has found that corporations actively \nmanaging and planning for climate change achieved an 18 percent higher return on investment \n(ROI) than those that are not. These forward-thinking companies enjoy ROI performance that is \n67 percent better than companies that fail to even disclose their emissions. 32\nInstitutional investors are engaging companies in their portfolios on clean energy related issues \nwith both the financial opportunities and risks in mind. They are focused on two key sectors \u2013 \nelectricity and transportation \u2013 particularly in the context of U.S. policy developments.\nRealizing opportunities and limiting risks in the electricity and transportation sectors\nAny strategy aimed at reducing greenhouse gases requires significant focus on the electric power \nand transportation sectors. As Figure 3 shows, these two sectors alone constitute 60 percent \nof U.S. emissions. The capital expenditures electric and transportation companies make in the \nnext few years will determine the trajectory of U.S. emissions for decades; poor decisions could \nlock us into a high-carbon future. At the same time, however, utilities and auto manufacturers \ncan use their considerable balance sheets to finance clean energy and advanced technology \ndeployment while protecting and enhancing shareholder value.\n32  CDP, Climate Action and Profitability: CDP S&P 500 Climate Change Report 2014, https://www.cdp.net/CDPResults/CDP-SP500-leaders-report-2014.pdf\nFigure 2: U.S. emission sources\nAccelerating U.S. Clean Energy Deploymen: nvestor Policy Priorities     11\nElectric utility sector\nClean energy poses a risk to outdated utility business models. As energy efficiency has been \ndeployed at greater scale, U.S. electricity consumption growth has flattened and in a number \nof markets is in decline, resulting in lost revenues from power sales for electric utilities \nnationwide.33 At the same time, distributed resources not owned by utilities such as residential \nand commercial rooftop solar pose the risk of further reducing demand as customers receive \nan increasing amount of their energy needs through these distributed resources. In an extreme \nscenario, utilities could end up in a financial \u201cdeath spiral\u201d where the fixed costs of maintaining \nthe electric grid is spread over shrinking customer bases and lower sales, resulting in higher \nrates, and subsequently an impetus for more customers to reduce demand through greater \nefficiency and self generation. This risk has led Barclays to downgrade the credit rating of the \nentire U.S. electric sector.34 Another bank, UBS, has stated that with solar \u201con the edge of being \na competitive power generation technology [and battery prices falling rapidly]\u2026we expect \ntransformational changes in the utility [sector].\u201d35\nIn response to this challenge, some utilities and states have sought to limit competition \nthrough punitive charges to distributed energy resources, including limits to net metering, \nchallenges to capacity market compensation for demand response, requests for above market \npower-purchase agreements for uncompetitive fossil and nuclear generation, and prohibitions \nagainst renewable energy contracts between non-utility companies and electricity customers. \nOthers, like independent power producer NRG, are reconfiguring their business models to \ngenerate revenue from renewable energy, energy efficiency, storage, and other customer \nenergy services. In addition, many utilities are recognizing the value of electric vehicles both \nas a way of compensating for decreased demand and of managing load. Given the increasing \ncompetitiveness of clean energy, investors have an interest in the utilities finding ways to \ngenerate revenue from clean energy rather than trying to limit its deployment. Failing to adapt \ncould result in a loss of shareholder value as new market entrants claim market share from \nincumbent utilities. \nAs Ceres\u2019 report, Practicing Risk Aware Regulation: What Every State Regulator Needs to \nKnow36 demonstrated, the threats to utility business models from new technologies come \nat a time when much of the United States\u2019 electricity infrastructure is nearing the end of its \nuseful lifetime. Given this aging infrastructure, it has been estimated that some $2 trillion in \ninvestment will be needed over the next 20 years, requiring annual investment roughly double \nrecent levels.37 This makes decisions about utilities\u2019 investments in long-lived infrastructure \ntoday critically important not only for the subsequent carbon emissions, but also the financial \nviability of the utilities. Beyond environmental regulations and the falling cost of alternative \ntechnologies, huge capital outlays, long construction times, and risk from natural disasters \n33  U.S. Energy Information Administration, \u201cU.S. electricity sales have decreased in four of the past five years\u201d, December 20, 2013, http://www.eia.gov/\ntodayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=14291 \n34  Michael Aneiro, Barclays Downgrades Electric Utility Bonds, Sees Viable Solar Competition, Barrons, May 23rd 2014, http://blogs.barrons.com/\nincomeinvesting/2014/05/23/barclays-downgrades-electric-utility-bonds-sees-viable-solar-competition/\n35  John Vidal, Big power out, solar in: UBS urges investors to join renewables revolution, The Guardian, August 27, 2014, http://www.theguardian.com/\nenvironment/2014/aug/27/ubs-investors-renewables-revolution\n36  Ceres, Practicing Risk Aware Regulation: what every state regulator needs to know,  http://www.ceres.org/resources/reports/practicing-risk-aware-electricity-\nregulation/view\n37  Marc Chapuka et al., Transforming America\u2019s Power Industry:The Investment Challenge 2010-2030, The Brattle Group (Washington DC: The Edison \nFoundation, 2008), vi, http://www.brattle.com/_documents/UploadLibrary/Uplad725.pdf. Brattle\u201ds investment estimates apply to the entire U.S. electric utility \nindustry, including investor-owned utilities (IOUs), electric cooperatives, and government-owned utilities. From 2000-2005, overall annual capital expenditures \nby U.S.  IOU\u2019s averaged roughly $48 billion; from 2006-2010 that number climbed to $74 billion; see Edison Electric Institute, 2010 Financial Review: Annual \nReport of the U.S. Shareholder-Owned Electric Utility Industry (Washington DC: Edison Electric Institute, 2011), 18, http://www.eei.org/whatwedo/DataAnalysis/\nIndusFinanAnalysis/finreview/Documents/FR2010_FullReport_web.pdf\n12     www.ceres.org\nand water constraints provide further reason for utilities to move away from business models \ndependent on regulated returns on investment in capital-intensive thermal generation. Figure \n3, taken from Risk Aware Regulation, demonstrates how different generation technologies \ncompare through the lens of both cost and risk. One will notice that cleaner technologies are \nnow competitive on a pure-cost basis. In addition, they typically have lower risk-profiles than \ntheir fossil fuel powered alternatives.\nInstitutional investors have significant exposure to utilities. In fact, market capitalization in \nshareholder-owned utilities was over a half-trillion ($504.4 billion) at the end of 2013.38 With \nthe aforementioned $2 trillion dollars of expected investment in new infrastructure, there is \nan opportunity to both ameliorate financial risks from utilities\u2019 current business models while \ndriving significant investment in clean energy infrastructure.\nTransportation sector\nLike the electric sector, automotive industries face financial risks from carbon-intensive \nproducts. When General Motors and Chrysler entered bankruptcy at the end of the last \ndecade, one oft-cited reason for their financial troubles was their over-reliance on sales of \ninefficient SUVs.  As a result of the financial downturn and rising oil prices, SUV sales dropped \nprecipitously. With the bankruptcy of GM and Chrysler, shareholders in the companies saw the \n38  Edison Electric Institute, \u201cIndustry Data: statistical highlights\u201d, accessed 03/02/2015, http://www.eei.org/resourcesandmedia/industrydataanalysis/\nindustrydata/Pages/default.aspx\nFigure 3: Cost and Risk of Electrical Generating Technologies\nAccelerating U.S. Clean Energy Deploymen: nvestor Policy Priorities     13\nvalue of their equity decimated. Going forward, shareholders face risks from companies that \nfail to meet global demands for greater efficiency and innovate, especially as formidable new \nparticipants like Tesla, Apple and Google enter the arena.  \nUnlike the 1970s, U.S. automotive manufacturers face a world where the bulk of future growth \nwill be in foreign markets (particularly in China and other East Asian countries), which have \ntightening vehicle emission and fuel economy standards. Further, as more companies move \ntoward global platforms in order to reduce fixed costs, it behooves them to develop and produce \nefficient vehicles. In turn, suppliers of advanced technologies, including those for electric \nvehicles, stand to benefit from the production of more fuel-efficient vehicles as well.   Recent \nanalysis by CDP suggests that as global vehicle standards rise, laggards are at risk of significant \npenalties that could impact shareholders. According to CDP\u2019s analysis, GM, Fiat-Chrysler, \nand Ford could face efficiency standard non-compliance fees of 33 percent, 15 percent, and 16 \npercent of earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), respectively. These fees are significant and \na competitive disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis BMW, Volkswagen, Daimler, Hyundai, and Nissan, which \nare unlikely to face any fines.39\nCorporate clean energy adoption\nWithin the past several years, new players have entered into utility-scale renewable energy \nprocurement that was previously the exclusive domain of utilities. The country\u2019s 25 largest \ncorporate solar buyers, including Walmart, Kohls, and Costco, have deployed over 445 MW \nof solar.40 Companies like Microsoft, Mars, IKEA, Google, and Facebook have become major \nwind purchasers, each procuring hundreds of megawatts of wind power. These companies \nare becoming the norm: Ceres\u2019 Power Forward 2.0 report showed 43 percent of Fortune 500 \ncompanies (and 60 percent of Fortune 100 companies) have a renewable energy target, energy \nefficiency target, and/or a greenhouse gas reduction target.41 \nWhile the reasons for pursuing corporate clean energy targets vary, they hold the promise of \ngenerating value for investors while creating a channel for indirect investment in clean energy \ninfrastructure. Energy efficiency has clear cost saving benefits; generally, with very short \npayback periods as efficiency investments translate into enduring energy cost reductions. And as \nrenewable energy becomes increasingly competitive, companies can not only lock in affordable \nclean energy, they can enter into long term contracts that take advantage of solar and wind\u2019s \nlow operating costs and provide a valuable hedge against volatile energy costs. Power Forward \n2.0 showed that among Fortune 100 companies, over $1.1 billion in annual cost savings were \nachieved as companies pursued their clean energy targets. This frees up valuable resources that \ncan be returned to shareholders or reinvested to grow the company.\nImproved shareholder value through efficient real estate\nReal Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) are one group of corporations that could benefit their \ninvestors through greater clean energy deployment. REITs are widely held by both institutional \ninvestors and individual investors as they are a substantial and liquid asset class, with REITs \nconstituting over $800 billion in market capitalization and trading on exchanges just like other \nlisted equities42. Given the financial benefits of clean energy adoption, investors are interested in \n39  CDP, \u201cNo Room for Passengers: Are auto manufacturers reducing emissions quickly enough?

Between 2012 and 2013, INCR members filed 17 \nresolutions that included specific requests for building energy efficiency information.43 Five of \nthese requests were directly targeted to real estate firms.44\nThe investors\u2019 filings with companies note the link between sustainability efforts and \nshareholder value, calling for comprehensive sustainability reports that outline sustainability-\nrelated risks, opportunities, policies, and practices. Studies show Energy Star and LEED \nbuildings perform better; investing in more efficient buildings could increase REITs\u2019 profitability \nand therefore investor returns.\nPOL ICY IMPL ICAT IONS AND RECOMMENDAT IONS\nAchieving increased investment opportunities in clean energy across asset classes \u2013 from direct \ninvestment in projects, to semi-direct investments via asset-backed securities, YieldCos and \nother vehicles, to indirect financing of clean technology through shareholder equity in corporate \nbalance sheets \u2013 requires policies that support increased deployment of these technologies while \nalso more directly enabling channels for investor and corporate financing of clean energy.\nEnabling deployment of clean energy technologies is a key prerequisite to institutional \ninvestment. As deployment of clean energy technologies scales, innovation in the products, \nbusiness models, and financing of those technologies takes place. This allows for greater \nopportunities for investment. It is through this process that a virtuous cycle of economies of \nscale and innovation takes place where greater deployment means further reductions in prices, \nwhich, in turn, enables more deployment and additional innovation. Policies supporting clean \nenergy technologies create an opportunity for private capital to be put to work at a greater scale \nover time. Indeed, this is historically how the United States has supported new technologies. As \nhighlighted in Figure 4,45as technologies develop there are greater roles for new sources of capital, \n43  based on unpublished analysis of shareholder resolutions available at http://www.ceres.org/investor-network/resolutions \n44  ibid\n45 Figure from: Frankfurt School FS-UNEP Collaborating Centre for Climate & Sustainable Energy Finance & Bloomberg New Energy Finance, \u201cGlobal Trends \nin Renewable Energy Investment 2014\u201d, http://www.unep.org/pdf/Green_energy_2013-Key_findings.pdf\nFigure 4: Technology Development and Capital Sources44\nAccelerating U.S. Clean Energy Deploymen: nvestor Policy Priorities     15\nfirst private equity (including venture capital) and then public capital markets (listed equity \nand debt). This is where the majority of institutional investors\u2019 assets are invested. Scaling \ntechnology and bringing it through this development cycle reduces investment risk, enables \ngreater participation of institutional investors through a growing role for public capital markets, \nand will reduce the cost of capital for clean energy projects.\nThroughout its history, the U.S. federal and state governments have used legislative and \nregulatory powers to foster the development of the United States\u2019 domestic resources. As the \nUnited States expanded in the mid- and late- nineteenth century, the federal government \nprovided land grants to subsidize the settlement of the country. During the first half of the \n20th Century, electrification was expanded from urban centers to rural communities through \nthe Rural Electrification Act, which provided loans for rural electrification. More recently, the \nU.S. government supported the development of the shale oil and gas industry through $10 \nbillion in tax incentives and millions more in government-funded research.46 And following \nthe 2008 financial crisis, the federal government committed substantial \u201cstimulus\u201d funding to \nclean energy deployment through various programs including over $31 billion in Department of \nEnergy Funds allocated under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.47\nJust one example of the value of policy helping to support the scaling of clean energy is the \nsolar industry. Increasing solar deployment has led to dramatic decreases in the cost of solar \nenergy. In fact, solar has seen a 99 percent decline in cost since the 1970s and an 80 percent \nreduction since just 200848 (Figure 5). As technologies have gotten cheaper, consumers \u2013 from \nhomeowners to Walmart \u2013 have been able to adopt49renewable energy and new business models.  \n46   American Energy Innovation Council, \u201cCase Studies on the Government\u2019s Role in Energy Technology Innovation: Unconventional Gas Exploration and \nProduction,\u201d http://americanenergyinnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Case-Unconventional-Gas.pdf (2013)\n47  http://www.energy.gov/recovery-act\n48  Business Council for Sustainable Energy and Bloomberg New Energy Finance, Sustainable Energy in America Factbook 2014 , February 2014, 3, www.\nbcse.org/factbook/pdfs/2014%20Sustainable%20Energy%20in%20America%20Factbook.pdf \n49 Tom Randall, \u201cWhile You Were Getting Worked Up Over Oil Prices, This Just Happened to Solar,\u201d Bloomberg Business, October 29, 2014, http://www.\nbloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-10-29/while-you-were-getting-worked-up-over-oil-prices-this-just-happened-to-solar\nFigure 5:  Cost reductions for solar48\n16     www.ceres.org\nMeanwhile, financial innovations \u2013 such as YieldCos and solar asset-backed securities \u2013 have \nfurther reduced costs and helped to grow the industry. Solar City is just one example of how \npolicy has spurred business model and financial innovation and brought new sources of capital \ninto clean energy financing (See Solar City Case Study on Page 8).\nEnable clean energy scale and financial innovation\nSupporting scaling clean energy technology means supporting policy instruments that are \nalready in place and work. The Production Tax Credit (PTC), Investment Tax Credit \n(ITC), and accelerated deprecation are the most important federal incentives \nfor wind and solar deployment in the United States.50 Even though few institutional \ninvestors in the United States can utilize tax credits and depreciation directly by providing \ntax equity to projects (public pension funds are categorically excluded as they are tax-exempt \nentities), some can invest in other elements of renewable energy finance and in refinancing \nrenewable energy projects once the tax credits expire. The scale provided by incentives in the \nU.S. tax code has been critical to developing the semi-direct and indirect investment vehicles \ndescribed above, such as YieldCos and solar asset-backed securities. \nWhile other sectors enjoy stable tax treatment, the wind industry in particular has experienced \na policy-driven boom and bust cycle through multiple expirations and relatively brief \nreinstatements of the production tax credit. As policymakers consider comprehensive tax \nreform, they should provide near-term stability and investment predictability to the industry \u2013 \nwhich has seen the PTC again lapse at the end of 2014.  Policy uncertainty and the expiration of \nthe PTC has significantly depressed recent investment in wind projects.\nAs policymakers provide PTC, ITC, and depreciation certainty in short-term and comprehensive \nchanges to the U.S. tax code, they should also expand provisions of the tax code that have \nprovided investment vehicles for other types of infrastructure. REITs and Master Limited \nPartnerships (MLPs) in particular are two investment vehicles that the tax code \ndoes not currently allow to be applied to clean energy; the relevant tax code \nprovisions should be expanded to include clean energy infrastructure.\nIn 1960, Congress created REITs to provide a liquid investment vehicle for real estate \ninvestment, with advantageous pass-through tax structures (i.e., no taxation at the corporate \nlevel). Historically REITs have been focused on commercial real estate, though both the universe \nof eligible infrastructure and the scale of U.S. REITs has expanded to finance billboards, cellular \nphone towers, prisons, and other infrastructure. The universe of 204 REITs registered with the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission were together valued at a U.S. market capitalization of \n$719 billion as of January 2014,51 making them a substantial and common investment. Despite \nproviding similar characteristics to real estate\u2014 such as predictable and steady revenue streams \nand immovable infrastructure \u2013 renewable energy infrastructure has to date been excluded \nfrom REIT status. While the Internal Revenue Service recently moved to allow renewable energy \non REIT owned buildings, there is considerably more scope for expanding REITs to act as an \ninvestment vehicle for renewable energy projects.\n50  US Partnership for Renewable Energy Finance (USPREF), Renewable Energy Policy, Finance, and Market Overview, April 2014, http://uspref.org/images/\ndocs/Renewable_Energy_Market_Overview_April_2014.pdf \n51  REIT.com, \u201cIndustry Data & Research: Historical REIT Industry Market Capitalization: 1972-2014\u201d\nAccelerating U.S. Clean Energy Deploymen: nvestor Policy Priorities     17\nWhile clean energy REITs could take a common semi-direct investment for real estate and \nexpand it to include renewable energy infrastructure, there are opportunities for indirect \ninvestment in clean energy through REITs as they are currently structured. Typical REITs, \nwhich own buildings, provide a tremendous opportunity for indirect investment in clean \nenergy that could subsequently improve returns on investment in those assets. As referenced \nearlier, there are documented financial benefits to investors from improving the efficiency of \nbuildings they own. However, most institutional investors do not own buildings directly, but \ninstead hold REITs. Unlike the accessibility of information regarding the energy performance \nof buildings owned by investors, accessing information on the energy performance of REIT \nbuildings is nearly impossible. If more cities adopted energy benchmarking and disclosure \nordinances - like those in Minneapolis, Chicago, Boston, New York, and other cities- investors \nwould have access to data on energy performance of REIT buildings. This data could be used to \ninvest in REITs with better energy performance.\nMLPs are similarly a tax-advantaged investment vehicle created by the U.S. tax code; they \nhave been a key vehicle for financing mostly mid-stream oil & gas assets. MLPs are a corporate \nstructure in which the partnership sells shares just as a corporation would sell stocks. Like \nREITS, MLP investments only face one layer of taxation, unlike a corporation where two layers \nof taxation exist: corporate taxes and taxes borne by investors for returns on their investments \nin the company. This tax-advantaged structure boosts yields and has made MLPs popular \ninvestments, particularly in the current low-yield investment environment. Like oil and gas \npipelines, renewable energy projects create the steady revenue streams (via sales of electricity) \nthat successful MLPs rely on. However, in an effort to limit overuse of the MLP structure, the \nlast comprehensive reform of the federal tax code in 1986 limited energy-related MLPs to \ninfrastructure for \u201cdepletable\u201d resources. Reintroduced in June, 2015, the bipartisan Master \nLimited Partnership Parity Act championed by Senator Chris Coons allows renewable energy \nprojects to qualify for the same tax treatment as midstream oil and gas projects.  This bill would \nincrease investment opportunities in renewable energy and lower financing costs.  Congress \nshould take up and enact the Master Limited Partnership Parity Act.\nScaling clean transportation \nIn the transportation sector, the Corporate Average Fuel Economy and GHG Standards \nfor passenger vehicles, developed by the Environmental Protection Agency and the National \nHighway Transportation Safety Administration, provide the opportunity not only to create \nconsumer fuel savings, but also drive increased profits for the auto industry. Indeed, a report \nauthored by Citi Investment Research in collaboration with Ceres showed that the CAFE/\nGHG standards will benefit automakers as a whole (a 5 percent increase in profits in 2020) and \nU.S. automakers even more (6 percent increase in profits in 2020).52 In 2018, the agencies will \ndetermine whether the 2022-2025 standards will be strengthened, preserved or weakened; it \nis critical that they are at least preserved in order to spur innovation and enhance the global \ncompetitiveness of U.S. auto manufacturers.\n52  Itay Michaeli, Christopher Reenock, Dev Kapoor, \u201cFuel Economy Focus: Perspectives on 2020,\u201dApril 3, 2012,http://www.ceres.org/resources/reports/fuel-\neconomy-focus-industry-perspectives-on-2020/view  \n18     www.ceres.org\nIn 2015, the U.S. federal government released a proposed GHG emissions/efficiency \nstandard for heavy trucks to meet in 2019 and beyond. Like its CAFE sibling, this standard \nholds potential for increased shareholder value for institutional investors. Improved heavy truck \nefficiency will reduce freight costs for a range of industries, reducing a significant operating cost \nand thus boosting net revenues. Research done by M.J. Bradley & Associates for Ceres and the \nEnvironmental Defense Fund found that strong standards could save sleeper truck operators \n$18,000-$38,000 the first year of service, and lower the per mile cost of heavy truck operation \nby 2.6% by 2030 and 6.8% in 2040.53\nIn addition to improving fuel efficiency, reducing the carbon footprint of the transportation \nsector also requires the development of alternative low carbon fuels, which provides another \nopportunity for institutional investors. California, Oregon and British Columbia have adopted \nclean fuel standards, which require fuel providers to gradually reduce the carbon intensity of \nvehicle fuels. Rather than prescriptively requiring particular technologies or fuels, the standard \nallows fuel suppliers the flexibility to choose how they meet emissions targets through various \nmeans, such as blending biofuels into gasoline, reducing emissions in production processes, \nor purchasing credits from utilities supplying low carbon electricity to electric vehicles. These \nstandards drive investment in alternative fuels, which will diversify the fuel pool and reduce \npetroleum dependency. Such standards mirror the successful model of renewable energy \nstandards employed in the electric sector, which have provided clean energy scale, innovation, \nand consumer choice in that sector. Analysis shows that this success can be replicated in fuels.  \nIn California, the standard has already driven investment in alternative fuels, and is expected \nto result in $1.4 - $4.8 billion in societal benefits by 2020.54 As Oregon has also adopted a \nclean fuels standard, benefits would be multiplied under an integrated West Coast market; \nrecent research shows that the clean fuel goals of the four jurisdictions of the Pacific Coast are \nsimultaneously achievable.55 These standards offer opportunities both across the economy and \nacross investment portfolios. \nEnable the evolution of utility business models to lower risk and enable clean energy adoption\nAs energy efficiency and renewable energy scale, utilities face competitive pressures and \nrevenue loss. While building owners historically have been passive consumers of electricity, \ncost-competitive renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies mean that home and \nbusiness owners can increasingly produce their own energy while using less. As shareholders \nin utilities, institutional investors risk that utilities will become unprofitable as their revenues \nerode. However, rather than supporting policies that make consumer adoption of clean energy \ntechnologies harder\u2014such as limitations to net energy metering and limitations to third-party \npower purchase agreements\u2014policymakers should enable these trends and spur utilities to \nadapt their business models and revenue sources accordingly. Indeed, doing so will enable these \nutilities to meet the demands of some of their largest customers.\n53  M.J.

As companies \nprocure renewable energy they are looking for supportive policy environments as they choose \nwhere to locate their facilities. Many of these companies want to procure their renewable energy \njust as they would other commodities- through a contractual arrangement for the commodity \nrather than owning and operating the equipment (e.g., solar panels) needed to produce the \ncommodity (i.e., electricity). In many cases, companies are entering into third-party power \npurchase agreements (PPAs) wherein a renewable energy company owns the electric generator \nand sells electricity to the customer at a fixed price over a long-term contact. However, in several \nstates, including North Carolina, Florida, Virginia56, and Georgia, it is illegal to enter into such \nenergy procurement arrangements\u2013 making it difficult if not impossible for companies to \nparticipate in electricity markets. The need for third-party power purchase agreements (PPAs) \nto support clean energy purchases is part of a broader need for true markets for electricity, a \nsector historically dominated by monopoly utilities. \nAfter federal tax credits, state renewable energy standards are the most important single \npolicy driver for renewable energy deployment;57 they are also a key mechanism for creating \nmarkets for renewable energy. The standards, currently in place in 29 states and the District of \nColumbia, require utilities to procure a certain amount of their energy from renewable energy \nresources by a certain year (e.g., 20 percent by 2020). Combined, these standards will require \nnearly 10 percent of U.S. electricity consumption to come from renewable energy resources by \n2020.58 Likewise, some states have created targets for utilities to increase their procurement \nof energy efficiency resources either through long-term standards, energy efficiency resource \nstandards, integrated resource plans, or through energy efficiency provisions in renewable \nenergy standards. As of 2015, 24 states had energy efficiency resource standards. \nAs documented in Power Forward, companies are looking to locate in several states with \nrenewable energy standards. These states are attractive markets for deploying renewable \nenergy. The presence of these standards helps create markets for renewable energy by building \nthe ecosystem of service and product suppliers. At the same time, companies often use these \nstandards as a way to participate in energy markets. By selling renewable electricity certificates \nproduced by their renewable energy facilities, companies generate revenue and help utilities \nmeet state renewable energy goals.\nThe Clean Power Plan (aka, the EPA Carbon Pollution Standards) is expected to be \nan additional catalyst for scaling clean energy deployment and enabling policies that support \ncorporate clean energy deployment. The final rules allow states considerable flexibility to reduce \nemissions on a state-wide basis through a combination of \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d: improved efficiency \nof fossil generation plants, increased utilization of low-carbon generation  plants, and use of \nnew no-carbon generation (e.g., renewable energy). EPA developed a \u201cBest System of Emissions \nReductions\u201d (BSER) based on the building blocks, and allows states to use a range of additional \napproaches, including energy efficiency, to achieve compliance.\n56  Note: Virigina has a small pilot program for third-party PPAs\n57  USPREF, 2014\n58 Climate Policy Initiative, \u201cWhat\u2019s Working and What\u2019s Not in State Renewable Portfolio Standards,\u201d July 7th, 2013,  http://climatepolicyinitiative.\norg/2013/07/11/whats-working-and-whats-not-in-state-renewable-portfolio-standards/\n20     www.ceres.org\nSupport strong EPA rules to limit methane emissions from the Oil & Gas sector\nIn the near-term, the Clean Power Plan will result in a shift of baseload generation from coal- to \nnatural gas-fired power plants. However, this will only result in a net reduction of greenhouse \ngas emissions if methane emissions from the natural gas sector are kept to a reasonable level. \nMethane is a powerful greenhouse gas - at least 84 times more powerful than carbon dioxide \nover a 20-year time period. About 30 percent of the warming we are projected to experience \nover the next two decades in a business-as-usual scenario can be tied to this year\u2019s greenhouse \ngas emissions from methane alone. The oil and gas sector is the largest industrial source of \nmethane emissions in the US, and recent studies have concluded that methane emissions from \nthe US natural gas supply chain are nearly double the official estimates. Fortunately, they can be \nmeaningfully reduced in a cost effective manner, and the EPA is working on regulations, to be \nreleased later this year, which will limit methane emissions for the first time. Ceres is working \nwith its investors to encourage EPA to take the strongest possible approach to regulating this \npowerful greenhouse gas.59\nCONCLUSION\n2015 is a pivotal year for climate policy, both globally and in the U.S. Negotiations in Paris come \nat a time when investment in clean energy technologies is falling short of the additional trillion \ndollars of investment that is needed annually to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. The \nUnited States will play a pivotal role not only in securing an international agreement, but also \nin driving much of the needed clean energy investment to reduce domestic and international \nGHG emissions. Institutional investors provide a massive pool of capital that could be tapped to \nhelp meet these goals, but currently their clean energy investments are relatively limited. While \na sufficiently strong price on carbon is the ultimate policy solution to drive direct, semi-direct, \nand indirect investment by institutional investors into clean energy infrastructure, this paper \nhas suggested a pragmatic near-term approach that can scale investment through existing policy \ninstruments in need of continued support or expansion.\n59 https://www.ceres.org/press/press-releases/investors-worth-1.5-trillion-support-white-house2019s-methane-emissions-reduction-plan\nCeres\n99 Chauncy Street, 6th Floor\nBoston, MA 02111 \n(617) 247-0700 \nceres.org\n",
