Introduction    The Accelerating Impacts of CGIAR Climate Research for Africa (AICCRA) project is administered by the Alliance of Bioversity International and the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT).    AICCRA is a project that helps deliver a climate-smart African future driven by science and innovation in agriculture. AICCRA builds on 50 years of CGIAR innovation, AICCRA works to scale climate-smart agriculture (CSA) and climate information services (CIS) that reach millions of smallholder farmers in Africa. AICCRA is already playing a vital catalytic role in strengthening the agricultural research architecture in Africa. Activities financed under AICCRA are being implemented by a broad coalition of CGIAR partners working at the regional, sub-regional, and national levels. AICCRA investments are concentrated in six anchor countries: Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Senegal, and Zambia, but spillover benefits are being realized in many other \u2018spillover\u2019 countries, such as Tanzania, Uganda, Chad, Niger and Nigeria among many more, as AICCRA works with Africa\u2019s regional economic communities (RECs) and their associated regional agricultural research and climate change networks.  The AICCRA project runs from early 2021 to 31 December 2023. This is the 2022 mid-year report for AICCRA, providing information on progress and key activities, as well as other topics such as the status of agreements, budget execution, and social and environmental safeguards.  2. Overall progress   AICCRA\u2019s progress in relation to Project Development Objective Indicators (PDOs) and Intermediate Project Indicators (IPIs) is on track.  According to the work implemented during the first semester of 2022 (and expectations from all cluster leaders for the rest of the year) we expect to surpass most 2022 targets for all indicators except PDO3, IPI 3.1, 3.2, and 3.5. For PDO3 and IPI 3.5, we expect that we will meet the 2022 targets, while we expect not to acheive targets IPI 3.1 and 3.2 by a small shortfall.   By the end of year two, according to our current estimates, AICCRA will achieve more than 69% of the final project target value for each PDO. For Components 1 and 2, the project will achieve more than 74% of each indicator's final project target. For Component 3, 55% or more. IPI 3.2 and 3.4 present the lowest percentage of achievement in relation to the 2023 final project targets (58% and 55% respectively). This was planned from the beginning of the project, and we do not anticipate any issues in reaching the agreed final targets by December 2023.     We estimate approximately 60% (of USD 60 million) budget execution in year two.    5 AICCRA mid-year report | 2022 AICCRA mid-year report | 2022 AICCRA cluster leaders are confident that by December 2023, all the targets for all indicators will be achieved.  2.1 Fiduciary   The available budget for 2022 is USD 32.464 million, which is composed of 13.219 million in carryover from 2021, along with 19.245 million in an annual allocation for 2022. In the first quarter of 2022, an execution rate of 13.7% (4.460 million) was achieved. For the second quarter of 2022, the cumulative budget execution was 28% (8.954 million).   This report excludes the April-June 2022 expenses from IFPRI, ICRAF and CCARDESA, which will be contained in the third quarterly financial report.  By the end of the third quarter of 2022, the expenditure rate is forecast to be 63.5% (20.614 million) of the entire available budget. An expectation has been set that all partners\u2014including the primary recipient The Alliance of Bioversity and CIAT\u2014is to make significant progress in budget execution to reach 85%-95% by the end of 2022.  Based on forecast expenses (20.614 million), a second Withdrawal Application (WA) was processed to disburse USD 16.221 million, which combined with the first WA of USD 10 million means that 43.7% of the total AICCRA budget of USD 60 million has been covered in cash. A third WA is planned, to be submitted following the presentation of the first bi-annual financial report.  In section 4 (Fiduciary details) and in the Annexes to this report, details of budget and expenses are provided, following the structure of AICCRA components, regions and countries.   2.2 Partnership agreements   For 2022, all partnerships started in 2021 were extended until 31 December 2022, and will subsequently run to the end of 2023 if progress and requirements are met during bi-annual reporting and monitoring via monthly AICCRA Core Team meetings. In the amendments for 2022, only Work Plans and Budgets for 2022 were updated following all inputs, which informed the project\u2019s overall Annual Work Plan and Budget (AWPB) for 2022.   Additional changes are being included in a third amendment, to include more detailed requirements on communication roles in each AICCRA cluster team.  2.3 Management and partner meetings  Management is coordinated through the Program Management Committee (PMC), which consists of the Director, thematic and regional Cluster Leads, and others, such as the Finance Manager and Global Communications and Knowledge Manager. This team meets monthly, but also has ad hoc meetings as required. The AICCRA Core Team (CT), which reaches more broadly    6 AICCRA mid-year report | 2022 AICCRA mid-year report | 2022 to also include country Cluster Leads, Science Officers as well as regional and national partners also meets on a monthly basis. AICCRA clusters hold other, regular meetings. For example, Gender and Social Inclusion (GSI) workshops are held with gender researchers and cluster teams to coordinate and exchange knowledge on gender-responsive approaches to CSA and CIS. The PMC, CT and other teams use SharePoint for collaboration and knowledge management. In the regular CT meetings, a presentation is included either from a country cluster or partner, to update colleagues on activities or emerging topics of relevance to the team.   So far in 2022, the CT and the PMC has each met six times, five of which were virtual while once was in person. Topics covered in these meetings range from administrative issus\u2014finance, reporting, coordination mechanism\u2014to substantive updates on AICCRA projects and activities, planning events and global stakeholder engagements that require input from the entire team. The meetings allow coordination on important topics, but also facilitate knowledge sharing across clusters, sharing learning and exchanging ideas.   As one example, the PMC clarified the AICCRA monitoring and evaluation process, including attribution among clusters. A decision was made to write a survey on issues of relevance for the cluster teams, which could be addressed in follow up meetings with Monitoring and Evaluation focal points. Other examples of discussions include the framing of engagement and global events to best target different audiences. Often, the meetings are used to update on processes\u2014such as reporting\u2014or to give feedback on project resources, such as the website or the publication templates.  During this reporting period, the most significant event was a set of in-person meetings held in Accra, Ghana in March. This included a World Bank supervisory mission, a bi-annual meeting of the Independent Steering Committee, in-person CT and PMC meetings, a project site visit and finally a public forum that featured a keynote address from Ghana\u2019s Minister for Agriculture, speakers from country and regional partner organisations and more than a hundred guests. The field visit in particular allowed first-hand investigation of AICCRA activities being implemented in Ghana. The team now plans the next set of in-person meetings, currently scheduled for 28 November to 2 December in Senegal.  During the reporting period, new leads were named for AICCRA\u2019s thematic teams on policies and institutions and climate-smart agriculture.   2.4 Communications and outreach   AICCRA is now reaching a growing audience through a maturing digital presence, complemented by collaboration with organisations in AICCRA focus countries (e.g. Samba Shape Up) that translate and disseminate its learning directly for local farmers.   The AICCRA website (aiccra.cgiar.org) has seen 30,000 visits since its launch and contains more than 30 news items, blogs, and podcasts that are disseminated through AICCRA social media    7 AICCRA mid-year report | 2022 AICCRA mid-year report | 2022 channels. These platforms have seen consistent growth in followers and engagement. AICCRA\u2019s content pieces were also shared with 6,000 contacts through the inaugural AICCRA newsletter sent in June, to be followed by future editions on a regular basis. Additionally, AICCRA has achieved notable media coverage, particularly in Kenya\u2019s The Nation and Zambia\u2019s Daily Mail.   With an expanding communications team in 2022, efforts have been made to foster effective collaboration between AICCRA regions through regular check-in meetings and with closer alignment to communications efforts of CGIAR centers participating in AICCRA. For example, at the AICCRA Ghana mission, a two-day workshop saw the AICCRA Global Communications Manager facilitate training sessions for communications specialists, focusing on team workflow, templates, website management, social media, updates to CGSpace and MARLO, and events planning.   In addition to the Ghana public forum, AICCRA hosted a number of high-profile events by mid-year, including two sessions at the World Bank\u2019s Innovate4Climate and side-events at Stockholm+50 and the UNFCCC SB56 in Bonn. AICCRA has also submitted applications for high-profile global engagement opportunities in the latter half of 2022, including UNFCCC Africa Climate Week, AGRF 2022, Climate Week NYC and multiple events at COP27.   A critical focus for the team in the coming months is preparations for COP27, centered on a new COP27 \u2018hub\u2019 for the AICCRA website, populated by methodically prepared narratives, media briefings, special reports, a blog series, photo essays, innovation stories and farmer profiles.    Additionally, communications capacity building workshops are planned for AICCRA partners.  2.5 Data management   The AICCRA Knowledge and Data Sharing team is continuously adapting the Managing Agricultural Research for Learning and Outcomes (MARLO) system for capturing progress towards our key performance indicators, activities, and deliverables. The system is fully operational and is supporting the project to capture our planning, progress, and final reports.  In the period covered by this progress report, we introduced two new modules at the cluster level:   1. Social and environmental management module: A new section to capture social and environmental management activities where cluster leaders are asked to fill in a template in word, sign it, and upload it in PDF format. The information then informs the ways AICCRA social and environmental safeguard specialists support colleagues.  2. Internal feedback module: Because it is essential to capture consistent and high-quality information in MARLO, we have developed an internal feedback module that allows the PMC to provide feedback to cluster leaders. The module was introduced during this progress reporting process and was successfully adopted by all cluster teams (see training manual).    8 AICCRA mid-year report | 2022 AICCRA mid-year report | 2022 2.6 Social and environmental safeguards  Summary of grievances received and managed through AICCRA Grievance Mechanism (GM)  The AICCRA project received and successfully resolved 12 complaints and responded to 20 information requests in 2022. No complaint was recorded on Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (SEA) or Sexual Harassment (SH). Further details are provided in the Table 1 below.    Table 1: Summary of grievances and Information requests received and managed Indicators Ghana Senegal Kenya Ethiopia Zambia West Africa E&S Africa Total Number of grievances received  6 0 3 0 1 1 0 12 Number of grievances resolved 6 0 3 0 1 1 0 12 Average resolution time 14 days - - - 4 days 1 day - - Number of information requests received  3 2 8 3 0 1 3 20 Number of responses transmitted  3 2 8 3 0 1 3 20 Average response time 2 days 12 hours 1 day 1 week 3 days 1 day 1 week -   Other Environmental and Social updates   Institutional capacity to manage environmental and social risk: With support of World Bank Environmental and Social (E&S) Specialists in March 2022, the AICCRA project conducted a two-day capacity building training for the six AICCRA E&S focal persons. The training has supported these project E&S Focal Persons to independently advise project staff on essential E&S procedures, and manage E&S issues at the country level. Beyond internal capacity building, two E&S Specialists that lead on E&S matters for the AICCRA project also completed World Bank training sessions on SEA/SH.   Stakeholder Engagements: The project obtained the World Bank\u2019s approval for the eight stakeholder engagement plans (SEPs) prepared for the project clusters as well as the overall project Grievance Mechanism (GM). The SEPs and the GM were both disclosed at the country level and on the AICCRA project website. Based on the approved SEPs, diverse stakeholder consultations and project information dissemination sessions were held. These consultations were held with a range of project stakeholders, including (but not limited to) officials from government agencies, development partners and the private sector among whom were women, persons with disability, the elderly, youth, and marginalized groups. The table below provides further details.

These LMPs have been disclosed and put into action. All project staff have already signed the Code of Conduct (CoC). In addition, new project staff and consultants that were engaged during this reporting period also signed the CoC.  Table 3: Number of new project workers signing CoC  Project Cluster Number of new project workers signing CoC Mali 5 Ethiopia 5 Kenya 0 Senegal 1 Ghana 20 Zambia 0   Prevention of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (SEA) and Sexual Harassment (SH): The overall project SEA/SH action plan was also approved by the World Bank and subsequently disclosed on the AICCRA website. The implementation of this action plan has since been decentralized to the various project implementation levels.  Assessment and management of E&S risks in project activities: Consistent with the requirements of the project Environmental and Social Commitment Plan (ESCP), the AICCRA project conducted rigorous E&S risk assessment of project activities that are being implemented in the six focal countries. Based on the key E&S risks identified, particularly in the field demonstration of CSA innovations, the project prepared Environmental and Social Management Plans (ESMPs) for the six focal countries. The six ESMPs prepared were sent to the World Bank and are at various stages of approval. The AICCRA E&S Specialists also provided various levels of support for implementation and monitoring of the E&S risk mitigation measures considered in the ESMPs.       10 AICCRA mid-year report | 2022 AICCRA mid-year report | 2022 3. Results framework: Progress towards outcomes and indicator targets   3.1 Tracking progress   In order to ensure progress towards the indicators, the PMC divided the annual targets for indicators amongst clusters with the understanding that some clusters may over-achieve, and other clusters under-achieve given the specific conditions each cluster faces.   Clusters have indicated their progress and likelihood of achieving the annual targets. In general, clusters have indicated that they are on track to achieve the 2022 targets.   The summary of progress, in terms of the target numbers, is indicated in the comments column of the table below. More details on progress are given in the following sections.   3.2 Project Development Objective Indicators  Table 4: PDO Indicators  Indicator Name  Base-line Intermediate Targets End Target Comments    Year 1 Year 2 Year 3   Access increased to climate-relevant knowledge, technologies, and decision-making tools PDO 1: CCAFS partners and stakeholders in the Project area are increasingly accessing enhanced climate information services and/or validated climate-smart agriculture technologies. (Number)   0 2 34 60 60 The target was set at 34 but according to already implemented activities, we predict that we will reach 52 by the end of the year.

(Number)   0 0 930,000 1,500,000 1,500,000 The target was set at 930,000 but strategic engagement during 2021 paved the road for a more ambitious estimate  of 1,040,400 by the end of the year. PDO 3: Enhanced climate information services and/or validated climate-smart agriculture technologies originating in one SSA country are increasingly being made accessible in other SSA countries. (Number)   0 1 6 6 6 The target of six countries is expected to be met by the end of the year.      11 AICCRA mid-year report | 2022 AICCRA mid-year report | 2022 3.3 Intermediate results indicators by components  Table 5: Intermediate results indicators  Indicator Name  Baseline Intermediate Targets End Target Comments  Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 1. Knowledge Generation and Sharing  IPI 1.1: Climate-relevant knowledge products, decision-making tools and advisory services created or enhanced including a proportion targeting gender and social inclusion dimensions (Number)   0 18 45 90 90 The target for 2022 is 45 such products, tools, etc., but we expect to surpass that target and have a total of 55 by the end of the year. All 12 clusters will be contributing to this indicator. Many of the deliverables are being co-developed with or led by partners.  IPI 1.2: AICCRA-funded peer-reviewed research papers made available in open access format (Number)   0 10 23 32 32 We are on track to deliver slightly more peer-reviewed papers than the set target. All 12 clusters are also contributing to this indicator. The papers will cover a diverse set of topics, including crop water management, empowerment in climate resilient agriculture, and CSA bundling. IPI 1.3: Satisfaction with the quality and usefulness of climate\u2013relevant knowledge products, decision-making tools and services received under AICCRA expressed by surveyed partners and stakeholders (Percentage)   0 80 75 75 75 This is proposed to be based on an annual survey to be conducted at year end.  2. Strengthening Partnerships for Delivery IPI 2.1: Climate advisory platforms/hubs launched/ strengthened, including their focus on gender and social inclusion (Number)   0 0 6 8 8 The target was set at 6, and we project that we will report 7 by the end of 2022, including five of the six country clusters. IPI 2.2: Partnerships launched/ strengthened between AICCRA-funded CGIAR and NARS scientists, universities, public sector stakeholders, farmer organizations, NGOs and private sector (Number)   0 20 20 35 35 The target was set at 20, but we expect to report on a diverse set of 33 partnerships launched or strengthened by the end of 2022.

Validating Climate- Smart Agriculture Innovations through Piloting IPI 3.1: Validated climate information services and climate-smart agriculture technologies disseminated / made accessible (Number)   0 1 18 18 18 We estimate  17 validated CIS/CSA technologies disseminated by the end of 2022. The slight underachievement is due to severe droughts that have undermined the promotion of seed varieties and challenges with WB administrative procedures that have delayed the implementation of participatory rangeland management in Kenya. IPI 3.2: Climate information services and climate-smart agriculture technologies reaching women through customized programs targeting their interests (Number)   0 1 20 36 36 The target was set at 20, but we expect to report 19 CIS/CSA packages and technologies, specifically targeting and/or reaching women with seven clusters contributing. Extreme weather events have affected the contribution of an additional country cluster. IPI 3.3: Use or adaptation of AICCRA-funded climate-relevant knowledge products, decision-making tools and services stated and confirmed by surveyed partners and stakeholders (Percentage)   0 61 13 25 25 This is proposed to be based on an annual survey to be conducted at year end. IPI 3.4: Discussions in Africa-wide and regional events informed by AICCRA funded project outputs (Number)   0 6 9 20 20 The target was set at 9 but we expect to report on 10 Africa-wide and regional events, with  four clusters contributing. IPI 3.5: Policy and investment decisions influenced by engagement and information dissemination by AICCRA funded partnerships and capacity building activities (Number)   0 4 11 15 15 The target of 11 policy and investment decisions influenced is expected to be met by the end of 2022.  3.4 Progress towards Project Development Outcomes (PDOs) PDO1. By the end of 2022, we estimate that 52 partners in the project area will increasingly access enhanced climate information services (CIS) and/or validated climate-smart agriculture (CSA) technologies. Our planned target was 34, but judging by activites already implemented, we predict that we will surpass this target.  As an example, work is occurring in Zambia in relation to innovative partners. By the end of 2022, AICCRA partners and stakeholders in Zambia will gain access to enhanced CIS and validated CSA primarily through the Accelerator Program, and through targeted CIS products tailored for key partners. In particular, the 13 AICCRA-Zambia Accelerator partners will be in implementation mode by the end of the year, which will result in 4 CSA/CIS innovation bundles (solar, aqua, seeds, integrated) being implemented.        13 AICCRA mid-year report | 2022 AICCRA mid-year report | 2022 PDO2. By the end of 2022, we estimate that 1,040,400 AICCRA beneficiaries in the project area will increasingly access enhanced climate information services and/or validated climate-smart agriculture technologies. Our planned target was 930,000, but strategic engagement during 2021 paved the road for a more ambitious target. One group of beneficiaries who will be reached by the end of the year is in Ethiopia, where AICCRA is working to make seasonal, sub-seasonal forecasts and information about extreme weather events accessible to agriculture extension workers (70,000), and health development agents (35,000) via analog and Next Generation tools through:   \u2022 Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) \u2022 Ministry of Health (MoH) \u2022 National Disaster Risk Management Commission (NDRMC) \u2022 Ethiopian Broadcasting Corporation (EBC) \u2022 FANA Broadcasting \u2022 Oromia Broadcasting Network (OBN) \u2022 Amhara Media Corporation (AMC) \u2022 Walta Media and Communication Corporate S.C.  Also in Ethiopia, close to 30,000 wheat farmers and value chain actors are already accessing bundled CIS and agro-advisories from the Ethiopian Digital AgroClimate Advisory Platform (EDACaP) including wheat rust management through the Lersha Digital Platform. The work in Ethiopia already initiated dissemination of CIS and CSA technologies to 10,000 farmers in four districts from three regional states through Digital Green. Efforts will be made to include 35-40% women and youth beneficiaries.  PDO3. In relation to spillover activities that achieve impact in non-focus countries, the target of six countries (outside the six primary focus countries) is expected to be met by the end of the year. Work in West Africa is being led by the Centre Regional de Formation et d'Application en Agrom\u00e9t\u00e9orologie et Hydrologie Op\u00e9rationnelle (AGRHYMET), which has become a key regional institution for reaching non-focus countries. Following its capacitation on the Next Generation seasonal forecast system, this regional climate center has started to build capacity in other national meteorological services within the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), to enhance climate information services via the adoption of this forecasting technology. Part of this work includes a spillover event led by AGRHYMET on intra-seasonal and sub-seasonal forecasts, targeted at both AICCRA focus countries and those that are the focus of the World Bank\u2019s Food System Resilience Program (FSRP).       14 AICCRA mid-year report | 2022 AICCRA mid-year report | 2022 3.5 Progress towards Intermediate Performance Indicators (IPIs)    Component 1: Knowledge generation and sharing  All clusters are making progress towards knowledge generation and sharing. The products being developed under this component fall into several categories:  \u2022 Tools and apps for farmers, extension agents and national decision makers;  \u2022 Reports, policy briefs and info notes for policy makers; and  \u2022 Curricula and training materials.  Peer-reviewed journal articles are also being prepared that synthesise lessons learned from work to date, propose new frameworks or models to aid in evaluation of CSA/CIS, or assess the gender responsiveness of CSA/CIS implementation.  IPI 1.1. Some of the completed knowledge products so far include: (i) A report reviewing gender equality and social inclusion components of CIS in Zambia; (ii) A gender assessment of climate-smart crop-small ruminant value chains in Ethiopia; (iii) a \u2018Learning Zone\u2019 on the AICCRA website that provides easy access to a wide variety of existing CSA tools; and (iv) A series of reports on food systems that will feed into discussions at COP27. Many more knowledge products and tools are planned to be completed by the end of the year. These will include: \u2022 A synthesis of the policy process for developing a climate-resilient long-term strategy in Senegal in conjunction with the national ministries of environment and agriculture;  \u2022 A gender and social inclusion scaling framework;  \u2022 A toolkit to support cost benefit and broader economic analysis of CIS prototypes, and many more for a targeted total of 55 by the end of 2022.  IPI 1.2. A number of journal articles published in 2022 include papers by the Kenya, Mali and Ethiopia country clusters. The Kenya team published a paper describing an open-source platform for collecting livestock market information from remote areas. A paper from Mali reviews the achievements and research gaps in water management research, including the technologies with high potential for transforming the rice-based systems that will be further refined and validated in Mali and other West African countries. The Ethiopia cluster published a paper on a data-mining approach for developing site-specific fertilizer response functions across wheat growing regions of Ethiopia. Additional papers are planned by all the clusters, with an expected target of 26 by the end of the year.       15 AICCRA mid-year report | 2022 AICCRA mid-year report | 2022 Compenent 2: Strengthening partnerships for delivery  Progress overall in this component is on track to meet or exceed expectations.  IPI 2.1 Prototypes or enhancements of platforms/hubs will be reported in five country clusters, the West Africa region and Theme 3 this year. Several of them will draw upon existing tools or platforms of national met services, regional climate centers, or the agriculture sector, including the Kenya Agricultural Observatory Platform (KAOP) and EDACaP in Ethiopia.  All will include a significant climate and weather component. The Ghana hub will include data and products to support the country\u2019s One Health initiative. Most platforms/hubs have adopted an explicit GSI component in the hub design process.  IPI 2.2  All clusters are either leading or supporting activities that engage a growing network of partnerships across public and private sector organizations, NGOs and academia at national, regional or continental scales. In 2022, we expect to report 33 partnerships formed or strengthened. These support a wide range of initiatives addressing digital agriculture technology, ag-advisory outreach and scaling, market information systems, education and training curriculum development, and national/regional/continental climate policy development among others. As an example, in curriculum development, partnerships in Ethiopia and Kenya will report at national scale involving universities and extension services. At regional scale this involves the WASCAL program for West Africa, and at continental scale it is delivered in partnership with RUFORUM.  IPI 2.3  All clusters are conducting a suite of capacity building activities during 2022 and expect to meet (or exceed) the targets for number of trainees. Collectively, clusters anticipate reporting 2,777 or more trainees for the year, considerably exceeding the target of 2,114. A large number of events consist of technical training on CIS tools and technologies, targeting national meteorological services and regional climate center staff in all AICCRA focus countries and regions. Another major set of trainings target agricultural research and development professionals (national agricultural research and extension systems, NGOs, and the private sector) and cover a range of topics including agricultural decision support tools, climate advisories, CSA innovations, CIS/CSA bundling, commercialization and scaling of CIS/CSA. Another group of trainings target policy professionals (public and private), and focus on foresight analysis, planning and international climate governance. Three clusters plan to engage with universities (faculty and students) on CIS/CSA curriculum development. Specific events are planned across several clusters focusing on GSI planning, and empowerment of women within research, policy, and business sectors. Additionally, the Gender Smart Agriculture framework was presented at a World Bank \u2018Brown Bag Lunch\u2019.         16 AICCRA mid-year report | 2022 AICCRA mid-year report | 2022 Component 3: Validating climate-smart agriculture innovations through piloting  All clusters are making good progress in validating CIS and CSA technologies (including gender and social inclusion considerations) through the piloting and development of bundled packages, linking them to technology transfer systems that improve farmers access alongside and other value chain stakeholders. This work informs planning and decision-making in choices of technology, and the enabling environment required for effective policy and investment.   IPI 3.1 AICCRA\u2019s six country clusters are validating and deploying a range of CSA/CIS technologies, services and bundled packages: (i) Off-grid solar irrigation and integrated aquaculture-agriculture systems in Zambia; (ii) In Ethiopia, wheat value chains and small ruminant smart packs include CIS, input information, market and product quality; (iii) In Ghana and Senegal, bundled drought tolerant varieties with climate-informed agro-advisories for cereals and legumes; (iv) In Kenya, sustainable business models for sorghum in drylands, dryland seed varieties, and livestock market information system; and (V) In Mali, drought and flood tolerant rice varieties, improved parboiling kits and the RiceAdvice tool used by service providers making site-specific recommendations.   By the end of 2022, due to the negative effect of severe droughts in Kenya that have undermined some field work, we are expecting a slight underachievement (17 out of the 18) against the annual target. Efforts to disseminate additional technologies/packages are currently in the pipeline.  IPI 3.2. Supported by the gender-responsive criteria (included in the prioritization and the co-development processes of CSA innovations carried out by all the country clusters) we expect to deploy 19 CIS/CSA packages and technologies, specifically targeting and/or reaching women in 2022. Gendered outreach on CSA, CIS and bundled packages will include, for example, natural resource management harvesting techniques in water (Senegal), improved cowpea and tomato seeds (Ghana), RiceAdvice and improved parboiling kits (Mali) and  engagement of women in participatory rangeland management for negotiating access to and sharing resources equitably (Kenya).   Those will be supported by a range of dissemination/scaling mechanisms such as working with national ag-data hubs and meteorological services on strategies for gender based advisory services that reach women through community based organizations and working with NGOs to support women who rehabilitate degraded landscapes (Ethiopia), training women service providers and womens organizations to provide personalized recommendations to women farmers (Mali) and supporting Agri-SMEs to promote gender-focused CSA innovation bundles (Zambia and Senegal).       17 AICCRA mid-year report | 2022 AICCRA mid-year report | 2022 IPI 3.4. AICCRA outputs developed by four clusters (Theme 1, Theme 2, West Africa, East and Southern Africa) are expected to inform 10 discussions in Africa-wide and regional events, meeting the planned annual target. Among others, these include: the regional Climate Outlook in both East Africa and West Africa and The Sahel, UNCCD COP15 in Abidjan, the biennial Africa Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) Conference, the West and Central African Council for Agricultural Research and Development (CORAF) symposium on agricultural research in West Africa, and the second scientific conference on climate change in the Sahel.   Results on our policy coherence work will inform a continental webinar while other research will contribute, among others, to the development of position statements of the African Group of Negotiators (AGN) for submission to the UNFCCC for COP27, informing discussions on food systems convened by AUDA-NEPAD and to the National Gender Action Plan developed for Ethiopia.  IPI 3.5. This year the annual target of 11 policy and investment decisions influenced by engagement and information dissemination by AICCRA-funded partnerships and capacity building activities, is expected to be met. Highlights include: contributions and backstopping to African Union Development Agency (AUDA-NEPAD) continent-level strategy for transforming Africa\u2019s food systems, and to the implementation of African Union Commission (AUC) Climate Change & Resilient Development Strategy and Action Plan 2022-2032 (Theme 1); climate-smart agriculture investment plans in Senegal and Kenya (Theme 2); World Bank De-Risking, Inclusion and Value Enhancement of Pastoral Economies (DRIVE) Project (Kenya).   In West Africa the work supported the CORAF Action Plan and Roadmap, to pursue their agenda on foresight analysis. It has also supported the Charter for Food Crisis Prevention and Management (PREGEC) plan led by the Food Crisis Prevention Network (RPCA), which was informed by next generation seasonal forecasts generated by AGRHYMET following AICCRA training. Finally, the Programme Building Resilience Against food and Nutrition Insecurity in The Sahel (P2RS) and plans for the second phase of the FRSP were influenced by AICCRA engagement with AGRHYMET, CORAF and ECOWAS.       18 AICCRA mid-year report | 2022 AICCRA mid-year report | 2022 4. Fiduciary details   The following sections review the financial management of AICCRA in 2022. A detailed financial report is provided to the World Bank 90 days after each calendar semester, as agreed in the Financing Agreement.   These financial reports follow agreed procedures in the Reporting of Uses of Grant Funds, that were negotiated for the Disbursement and Financial Information Letter.  4.1 Budget execution  The consolidated financial reports from the first and second quarter of 2022 from all AICCRA project participants show that expenditures amounted to USD 8.954 million.   This figure translates into a budget execution rate of approximately 28% from the entire available 2022 budget of 32.464 million. This is composed of 13.219 million in carryover from 2021, as well as a 19.245 million annual allocation for 2022.   As mentioned in section 2.1, the report excludes the expenses from IFPRI, ICRAF and CCARDESA covering the second quarter of 2022, which will be added in the third quarterly financial report.  USD 21.928 million is the available budget for 2023 activities. This figure will increase when the 2022 carryover is confirmed following the 2022 annual financial reporting, which is set for the first quarter of 2023.  Following agreed formats for financial statements (available in the annexes below) the following tables (listed below) present the expenditures for the first half of 2022, as well as the carryover from 2022, the combination of 2022 budget plus the carryover. Finally we show the remaining budget for 2023.  Table 6.1 Cumulative Budget Execution by Components / Sub-components Table 6.2 Dist ibution per Component, Subcomponent and Activity by Cluster (six sections) Table 6.3 Cumulative Budget Execution by Cluster Table 6.4 Distribution per Project Participant and year by Cluster  Table 6.5 Distribution per Project Participant by Cluster (set of 6 sections) Table 6.6 Cumulative Budget Execution by IDA Categories  4.2 Disbursements  Two advance payments have been processed during 2021 and the first half of 2022.   The first payment was USD 10 million, made via the established Withdrawal Application process in the World Bank\u2019s Client Connection platform.      19 AICCRA mid-year report | 2022 AICCRA mid-year report | 2022 This payment covered 53% of the 2021 budget allocation (USD 18,827,000). The payment was received in the designated bank account required for the project at JPMorgan Chase Bank on 30 November 2021. Given the significant volume of transaction requests pending execution by CIAT\u2019s Treasury Office, all payments to partners were eventually released throughout January and February 2022.  The second payment of USD 16,221,000 was made during the second quarter of 2022. Combined with the first payment of 10 million, the payments total USD 26,221,000, 43.7% of the project\u2019s estimated total budget of USD 60 million for 2021-2023.   Table 6.4 in Annex 1 shows the distribution\u2014by project participant\u2014of the first and second Withdrawal Applications that total USD 26,221,000.   A third payment will be agreed with the World Bank based on the expenses of the first half of 2022, and is planned to be released to partners before the second week of September 2022.  Before September 2023, all project Withdrawals Applications are planned to reach 85% of the total USD 60 million. The difference (15%) will be requested during the first quarter of 2024, upon the submission of the 2023 annual financial report.   4.3 Other financial management issues  No significant financial management issues have been identified during the first half of 2022. Regular monitoring is ongoing, with recommendations provided to main budget holders during monthly AICCRA CT meetings, as well as through reminders to partners (including the main recipient of the grant, the Alliance of Bioversity and CIAT) to plan and submit financial reports on time, as well as to monitor budget execution internally to reach expected levels.  4.4 Procurement update  The transition of key AICCRA staff from ICRISAT and ICRAF to ILRI and the Alliance of Bioversity International and CIAT took place alongside the re-allocation of funds from one regional partner\u2014SADC\u2014to remaining regional partners in Eastern and Southern Africa. These shifts in budget for 2022-20 3 were formalized in the 2022 Annual Workplan and Budget. Aside from these changes, no other changes have been made to the Project Procurement Strategy for Development (PPSD) document for 2022.       20 AICCRA mid-year report | 2022 AICCRA mid-year report | 2022 5. Lessons learnt and challenges   Enhancing coordination: As noted in previous reporting, the AICCRA project includes many partners, with activities coordinated across thematic, regional, and country clusters. While the project has existing coordination mechanisms, such as the PMC and CT meetings, the team is also exploring how to finetune and improve coordination. For example, through the inclusion of thematic leads in country coordination meetings where necessary. This provides avenues to coordinate for implementation.   Improving knowledge management: Mid-year and annual reporting is conducted through the MARLO platform, where teams report progress and activities that are then synthesized into the reports. While previous reporting cycles included feedback from the PMC, this took place externally to MARLO, which at times made this process unwieldy. In order to make this process more accurate and efficient, the Knowledge and Data Sharing Team created an internal feedback module in MARLO to allow the PMC to provide feedback to cluster leaders. By including this in MARLO, the PMC also has a record of feedback and modifications.  Expanding communications: The importance of communications and engagement for the project has become clearer as project implementation occured in 2022. This is for many reasons: increasing partner engagement; illustrating project outcomes in global forums; and connecting AICCRA to national, regional, continental and global processes such as National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) and the UNFCCC COP. The project works to ensure that each team commits sufficient resources to communications, and activities are sufficiently coordinated. To that end, each Partnership Performance Agreement (PPA) will now include a requirement that funds are earmarked for communications, and that there are regular communications coordination meetings. It has also become clear that there is a role for communications in generating the possibility of spillovers and scaling effects in countries outside the six focus countries, where communications with new stakeholders and audiences can support implementation. The AICCRA team is elaborating a strategy for this, including necessary capacity development.   Measuring Impact: In recent AICCRA meetings, one key lesson that has emerged relates to capturing impacts of the project, whether through the monitoring and evaluation processes or other research activities. The team is developing a process on data collection methods, particularly at farm and community level, including sampling and data archiving. This will be presented to the Independent Steering Committee in November 2022.  6.

INTRODUCTION  L\u2019agence Nationale de la M\u00e9t\u00e9orologie du Mali (MALI-METEO) a obtenu aupr\u00e8s d\u2019Africa Rice une subvention pour mettre en \u0153uvre le projet AICCRA (Acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer les impacts de la recherche climatique du CGIAR pour l\u2019Afrique). Cette initiative vise \u00e0 renforcer les capacit\u00e9s techniques, institutionnelles et humaines n\u00e9cessaires du Mali pour acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer l'adoption \u00e0 grande \u00e9chelle des technologies de l\u2019agriculture climato-intelligente face au changement climatique par les producteurs agricoles. Pour ce faire, il est n\u00e9cessaire de disposer d\u2019une base de donn\u00e9es organis\u00e9e, compl\u00e8te et fiable en vue de servir d\u2019intrants aux outils d\u2019aide \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision. C\u2019est dans cette optique que MALI-METEO a saisi l\u2019AGRHYMET \u00e0 travers l\u2019IRI pour redynamiser le data library de MALI-METEO, n\u00e9cessitant l\u2019utilisation de l\u2019outil Climate Data Tool (CDT). L\u2019Atelier a regroup\u00e9 les agents de MALI-METEO notamment ceux du service de la climatologie et changement climatique, le service de l\u2019agrom\u00e9t\u00e9orologie, le service de la pr\u00e9vision g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, le bureau informatique et le service du Programme des Pluies Provoqu\u00e9es et cadre national pour les services climatiques.  II. OBJECTIF  L\u2019objectif g\u00e9n\u00e9ral est de renforcer la capacit\u00e9 de MALI-METEO \u00e0 produire des donn\u00e9es climatiques de qualit\u00e9, exploiter le syst\u00e8me de pr\u00e9vision mondiale de prochaine g\u00e9n\u00e9ration pour am\u00e9liorer les pr\u00e9visions m\u00e9t\u00e9orologiques saisonni\u00e8res et intra-saisonni\u00e8res ainsi que l'utilisation des donn\u00e9es satellitaires. De fa\u00e7on sp\u00e9cifique, il s\u2019agira de former sur :  \u2713 L\u2019installation et le d\u00e9pannage sur CDT ; \u2713 le contr\u00f4le de qualit\u00e9 des donn\u00e9es ; \u2713 la correction de biais et downscaling (r\u00e9duction d\u2019\u00e9chelle des donn\u00e9es climatiques) ; \u2713 la combinaison des donn\u00e9es satellitaires avec celles des stations ; \u2713 la cartographie des donn\u00e9es climatologiques avec un accent particulier sur la quantification des incertitudes d\u2019interpolation ; \u2713 et l\u2019\u00e9laboration des produits climatiques d\u2019aide \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision (Calcul des normales, Dates de d\u00e9but de la saison, ETP, bilan hydrique, l\u2019indice standardis\u00e9 de pr\u00e9cipitations, les cumuls interannuels, ...). III. RESULTATS ATTENDUS A l\u2019issue de la formation, les r\u00e9sultats ci-apr\u00e8s sont attendus : \u2713 l\u2019outil CDT est op\u00e9rationnel ; \u2713 MALI-METEO dispose d\u2019une base de donn\u00e9es plus compl\u00e8te et fiable ; \u2713 la qualit\u00e9 des produits et services climatiques de MALI-METEO sont am\u00e9lior\u00e9s. IV. CEREMONIE D\u2019OUVERTURE La c\u00e9r\u00e9monie d\u2019ouverture de cette formation \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sid\u00e9e par le chef service Climatologique et Changement Climatique repr\u00e9sentant du Directeur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de MALI-METEO, M. Issa TRAORE.  M. TRAORE a souhait\u00e9 la bienvenue au formateur M. Bernard MINOUGOU et remercie Africa Rice pour le financement de cette formation \u00e0 travers le projet AICCRA. Il a rappel\u00e9 les objectifs de l\u2019atelier et les r\u00e9sultats attendus avant de souligner l\u2019importance de l\u2019outil CDT, surtout la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 du comblement des donn\u00e9es manquantes pour l\u2019am\u00e9lioration de la qualit\u00e9 de nos donn\u00e9es et produits m\u00e9t\u00e9orologiques. Son discours fut termin\u00e9 en invitant les participants \u00e0 \u00eatre attentifs et assidus pour l\u2019atteinte des objectifs. 3  Un tour de table a permis au formateur de conna\u00eetre les participants \u00e0 la suite de laquelle l\u2019agenda de la formation a \u00e9t\u00e9 amend\u00e9 avant le d\u00e9but de la formation pratique. III. D\u00e9roulement des travaux  1. M\u00e9thodologie  Apr\u00e8s l\u2019adoption de l\u2019agenda, l'atelier s'est d\u00e9roul\u00e9 en dix (10) jours avec une s\u00e9rie de travaux dirig\u00e9s par le formateur M. Bernard MINOUNGOU dont les participants ex\u00e9cutaient les diff\u00e9rentes t\u00e2ches ci-dessous : 1.1 Installation des logiciels Cette partie a concern\u00e9e l\u2019installation des diff\u00e9rents logiciels R, Rtool, Rstudio pour que CDT soit op\u00e9rationnel. Ces logiciels ont \u00e9t\u00e9 install\u00e9s par chaque participant y compris CDT. 1.2 Introduction sur quelques notions basiques du langage de R R est un logiciel de d\u00e9veloppement scientifique sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 dans le calcul et l\u2019analyse statistique. R est aussi un langage orient\u00e9 objet ; un environnement ; un projet open source (projet GNU) et un logiciel multi-plateforme (Linux, Mac, Windows).   Figure1 : Interface de l\u2019application et le logo du logiciel R  Les points abord\u00e9s dans cette section ont \u00e9t\u00e9 entre autres la d\u00e9finition, les principales fonctionnalit\u00e9s de R, les avantages et contraintes, la documentation, la structure des donn\u00e9es (vecteurs, matrices, Data.frame, les fonctions et les listes). Les diff\u00e9rents menus d\u00e9roul\u00e9s pour l\u2019initiation au logiciel R ont port\u00e9 essentiellement sur : \u2713 les op\u00e9rations usuelles sur R : (a=9, b=-5, C=a+b, f=a*b, g=a-b, h=a/b, i=a^b) \u2713 la cr\u00e9ation d'une s\u00e9rie pluviom\u00e9trique : pluie=c(900,600,1200,NA,650,150) \u2713 la cr\u00e9ation d'une s\u00e9rie de stations : Stations=c(\"Bamako\",\"Mopti\",\"Sikasso\",\"Kayes\",\"Segou\",\"Kidal\") \u2713 la v\u00e9rification d'une condition : verification=pluie>600 \u2713 le calcul de la moyenne : moyenne_pluie=mean(pluie,na.rm = TRUE) \u2713 le calcul de la pluie maximale et de la pluie minimale max_pluie=max(pluie,na.rm=TRUE) min_pluie=min(pluie,na.rm=TRUE) \u2713 le calcul de la m\u00e9diane 4  mediane_pluie=median(pluie,na.rm=TRUE) \u2713 le calcul de l\u2019\u00e9cart type et de la variance : ecart_type=sd(pluie,na.rm=T) var_pluie=var(pluie,na.rm=T) \u2713 le calcul des terciles : tercile33<-quantile(pluie,probs=1/3,na.rm=T) tercile66<-quantile(pluie,probs=2/3,na.rm=T) \u2713 le calcul de l'\u00e9cart interquartile (1/4 et 3/4) : iqr<-IQR(pluie, na.rm=T) \u2713 la g\u00e9n\u00e9ration automatique des vecteurs : elements100=seq(1, 100, 1) \u2713 la cr\u00e9ation de matrice : matrice1=matrix(seq(1,30), ncol=5) \u2713 le calcul de la moyenne de la matrice 1 suivant les colonnes Moyenne_Mat1= colMeans(matrice1,na.rm=T) Moyenne_Mat2=rowMeans(matrice1, na.rm=T) \u2713 le calcul de la minimal de la matrice 1 suivant les colonnes et les lignes min_mat1_col=apply(matrice1,2,min,na.rm=T) min_mat1_ligne=apply(matrice1,1,min,na.rm=T) \u2713 la cr\u00e9ation d'un dataframe (un dadata.frame  permet de cr\u00e9er un objet qui contient des characteurs, des valeurs numeriques, des valeurs logiques\u2026.) donnee=data.frame(STN=Stations, cumul=pluie, verif=verification) \u2713 l\u2019importation d'un fichier de donn\u00e9es RRTminTmax_annuel bamako=read.table(\"C:/Users/Admin/Documents/FormationCDT/RR minTmax_annuel.txt\", header=T,sep = \"\\t\",dec=\".\",na=\"-99\") \u2713 le calcul la pluie moyenne de la s\u00e9rie Pluie_moy_bamako=mean(bamako[,2]) \u2713 le calcul de l'\u00e9cart type  Ecart_Pluie_bamako=sd(bamako[,2]) \u2713 le calcul de l'indice de s\u00e8cheresse pluviom\u00e9trique de 1983 et l\u2019indice de toute la s\u00e9rie SPI_1983=(bamako_1983-Pluie_moy_bamako)/Ecart_Pluie_bamako \u2713 la visualisation des donn\u00e9es en courbe et la tendance  plot(bamako$Annee, bamako$Precipitation, type = \"l\",col=\"green\",      xlab = \"Ann\u00e9es\", ylab = \"precipitation[mm]\",      main = \"Evolution des precipitations\",lwd=2) Tendance=lm(bamako$Precipitation~bamako$Annee) abline(Tendance, col=\"red\",lwd=2) legend(\"topleft\",c(\"pluie\",\"Tendance\"),        col = c(\"blue\",\"green\"),        lty = c(1,1)) \u2713 la cr\u00e9ation d'une fonction calcul_Tmoy=function(tmin,tmax){   tmoy=(tmin+tmax)/2   return(tmoy) }   5  1.3 L'outil de donn\u00e9es climatiques en anglais Climate Data Tools (CDT)  CDT signifie Climate Data Tools et il s'agit d'une application bas\u00e9e sur une interface utilisateur graphique (GUI) pour le contr\u00f4le de la qualit\u00e9 des donn\u00e9es m\u00e9t\u00e9orologiques, l'homog\u00e9n\u00e9isation et la fusion des donn\u00e9es des stations avec des satellites et d'autres proxies telles que les donn\u00e9es de r\u00e9analyse. CDT offre une gamme de fonctionnalit\u00e9s, notamment la gestion des donn\u00e9es climatiques, le contr\u00f4le de la qualit\u00e9, le maillage des donn\u00e9es climatiques, la validation, l'analyse et la visualisation des donn\u00e9es climatiques. CDT est livr\u00e9 avec diverses fonctions pour accomplir ces diff\u00e9rentes t\u00e2ches. CDT est un package de R qui peut \u00eatre librement t\u00e9l\u00e9charg\u00e9 et utilis\u00e9 dans le logiciel statistique R. Cette application est maintenant utilis\u00e9e par diff\u00e9rentes agences m\u00e9t\u00e9orologiques du monde entier pour effectuer le contr\u00f4le de la qualit\u00e9 des donn\u00e9es de la station, g\u00e9n\u00e9rer des donn\u00e9es fusionn\u00e9es en fusionnant les donn\u00e9es de la station avec des donn\u00e9es satellitaires ou de r\u00e9analyse, effectuer diff\u00e9rentes validations, analyses et visualisations de donn\u00e9es climatiques. Les fonctionnalit\u00e9s disponibles dans CDT peuvent s'av\u00e9rer tr\u00e8s utiles pour les chercheurs travaillant dans les domaines du climat, de l'hydrologie, de la g\u00e9ographie et d'autres domaines qui doivent travailler avec des donn\u00e9es climatiques pour effectuer leurs analyses.  Figure2 : Interface de l\u2019application CDT.  1.4 Inventaires des donn\u00e9es  a. Donn\u00e9es issues des stations m\u00e9t\u00e9orologiques  Les donn\u00e9es utilis\u00e9es lors de cette formation sont issues de la base de donn\u00e9e de MALI-METEO. Ce sont des donn\u00e9es quotidiennes de la pluviom\u00e9trie, des temp\u00e9ratures maximales et minimales pour la p\u00e9riode 1991-2020 des treize (13) stations Synoptiques :Bamako-S\u00e9nou, Kayes, Y\u00e9liman\u00e9, K\u00e9ni\u00e9ba, Nioro, Kita, Bougouni, Sikasso, Koutiala, San, S\u00e9gou, Nara et Mopti . b. Les donn\u00e9es satellitaires de TAMSAT v3.1 Les donn\u00e9es estim\u00e9es de pluies journali\u00e8res du satellite TAMSAT v3.1 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 t\u00e9l\u00e9charg\u00e9es \u00e0 partir de l\u2019interface de CDT (Climate Data Tools) de 1991-2020 sur toute l\u2019\u00e9tendue du Mali (10 \u00b0N \u00e0 25\u00b0N et 12.5\u00b0W \u00e0 5\u00b0E).  6  c. Les R\u00e9analyses du JRA55  Les donn\u00e9es r\u00e9analyses des temp\u00e9ratures maximales et minimale quotidiennes du JRA55 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 t\u00e9l\u00e9charg\u00e9es \u00e0 partir de l\u2019interface de CDT (Climate Data Tools) de 1991-2020 sur toute l\u2019\u00e9tendue du Mali (10 \u00b0N \u00e0 25\u00b0N et 12.5\u00b0W \u00e0 5\u00b0E). d. Les donn\u00e9es du model\u00e9 num\u00e9riques de terrain Les mod\u00e8les num\u00e9riques de terrain produit par JRA55 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9galement t\u00e9l\u00e9charg\u00e9s sur les coordonn\u00e9es du Mali pour obtenir les altitudes avec une r\u00e9solution de 0.56\u00b0.  1.5 Mise en forme des donn\u00e9es stations  Les donn\u00e9es d\u2019entr\u00e9e sur CDT doivent \u00eatre dispos\u00e9es de la fa\u00e7on suivante comme l\u2019indiqu\u00e9 dans le tableau ci-dessous et enregistr\u00e9es aux formats *.txt (s\u00e9parateur : tabulation), ASCII ou CSV.      1.6 Contr\u00f4le Qualit\u00e9 (QC)  Les QC ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fait sur CDT. Ce contr\u00f4le de qualit\u00e9 repose sur des proc\u00e9dures suivantes : la v\u00e9rification des coordonn\u00e9es des stations, la d\u00e9tection des faux-z\u00e9ros et la d\u00e9tection de valeurs aberrantes.  a. La v\u00e9rification des coordonn\u00e9es g\u00e9ographique de la station Elle permet de d\u00e9tecter des stations ayant les m\u00eames coordonn\u00e9es, les stations avec de fausses coordonn\u00e9es et les stations en dehors des limites g\u00e9ographiques du Pays. Le r\u00e9sultat du contr\u00f4le de coordonn\u00e9es de stations pour le Mali s\u2019affiche comme suit :  Date :YYYYMMDD ID : Nom de la localit\u00e9 Coordonn\u00e9es des Stations Les donn\u00e9es quotidiennes 7    b. La d\u00e9tection des valeurs aberrantes : Cette \u00e9tape consiste \u00e0 la v\u00e9rification temporelle et spatiale des donn\u00e9es de pluies, des temp\u00e9ratures maximales et minimales compar\u00e9es \u00e0 la s\u00e9rie de la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode et aussi aux donn\u00e9es des stations voisines. En plus de la comparaison, elle consist\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9tecter  des temp\u00e9ratures maxi inferieures \u00e0 la temp\u00e9rature mini vise versa ou les erreurs suspicieuses. Au cours de cette formation, nous avons d\u00e9tect\u00e9 quelques valeurs suspectes. Mais avons prioris\u00e9 les cas o\u00f9 la temp\u00e9rature minimale d\u00e9passait la maximale qui sont des erreurs flagrantes.   D\u00e9tection des valeurs aberrantes \u00e0 Bamako-S\u00e9nou (TMIN TMAX) le 07/07/2002 et le 31/05/2013 et la d\u00e9tect\u00e9 des valeurs suspicieuses de 6 jours cons\u00e9cutifs avec la m\u00eame valeur \u00e0 Koutiala. . 1.7 L\u2019homog\u00e9n\u00e9isation des s\u00e9ries chronologiques avec CDT L\u2019homog\u00e9n\u00e9isation des donn\u00e9es consist\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9tecter les ruptures dans la s\u00e9rie et a les ajust\u00e9s \u00e0 partir de la moyenne ou de la m\u00e9diane. Nous avons fait un test d\u2019homog\u00e9n\u00e9it\u00e9 sur les donn\u00e9es des stations synoptiques au pas de temps journalier. L\u2019exemple de la station de Kayes qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9plac\u00e9 pour les travaux de la CAN 2002. Nous avons appliqu\u00e9 un ajustement de la s\u00e9rie par la moyenne. 8   D\u00e9tection de la rupture dans la s\u00e9rie des donn\u00e9es de la pluviom\u00e9trie \u00e0 Kayes  L\u2019ajustement de la s\u00e9rie par la moyenne. 1.8 Validation des donn\u00e9es  La validation des donn\u00e9es permet d\u2019\u00e9tudier la repr\u00e9sentativit\u00e9 des donn\u00e9es satellitaires par rapport \u00e0 la climatologie de la r\u00e9gion. Cette fonction disponible dans CDT nous a permis de valider les donn\u00e9es satellitaires/grill\u00e9es extraites aux emplacements des stations par rapport aux donn\u00e9es de la station. Cela peut \u00eatre fait pour les pr\u00e9cipitations et les temp\u00e9ratures.  9  Tableau n\u00b01 : statistiques des r\u00e9sultats de la validation des donn\u00e9es de TAMSAT sur la p\u00e9riode 1991-2020 sur les donn\u00e9es des stations synoptiques du Mali.  1.9 Calcul du biais moyen des produits satellitaires  Il existe 4 m\u00e9thodes de correction de biais disponibles dans CDT. Dans le cadre de notre travail nous avons travaill\u00e9 avec la m\u00e9thode des biais multiplicatif.

Models have been used\nto project the effects climate change can have on airborne particle concentrations. However, natural\nyear\u2010to\u2010year and longer\u2010term variations in weather can make it dif\ufb01cult to estimate the impacts speci\ufb01cally\ncaused by human forces. In this study, we use a large set of climate and air quality simulations to assess\nthe effect of natural variability in model\u2010based projections of climate change impacts on air pollution over\nthe United States. Our results show that natural variations in predictions of climate change effects on \ufb01ne\nparticle levels can be signi\ufb01cant. We recommend that projections use longer simulation lengths than\ntypically applied, 10 years or more, in order to \ufb01lter out this natural variability and better re\ufb02ect the effect of\nhuman\u2010caused climate change on particle pollution. Natural variability can also make it challenging to\ncon\ufb01dently project human\u2010caused climate impacts in some regions or if efforts are taken to reduce\ngreenhouse gas emissions. By using larger modeling lengths or simulation sets, projections of climate change\nimpacts on air pollution and climate policy bene\ufb01t analyses can be improved.\n1. Introduction\nClimate change can exert a large in\ufb02uence on air quality by altering meteorological conditions (Fiore et al.,\n2015; Jacob & Winner, 2009). As atmospheric ventilation, precipitation rates, atmospheric chemistry, and\nother key determinants of pollutant concentrations vary, climate change may deteriorate air quality over\nlarge regions (Dawson et al., 2014). The impacts on \ufb01ne particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations are\nparticularly important; ambient PM2.5 is the largest risk factor by attributable burden of disease with\nmillions of premature deaths caused by PM2.5 pollution each year (Cohen et al., 2017). Multiple modeling\nstudies have projected the impacts of climate change on PM2.5 concentrations (Day & Pandis, 2015; Nolte\net al., 2018; Trail et al., 2014). However, the effects of variations in climate on PM2.5 remain highly uncertain,\nwith signi\ufb01cant discrepancies among studies (Fiore et al., 2015). Inconsistencies are especially evident at\n\u00a92019.

To account for natural variability, most\nmodeling studies have relied on simulations covering multiple years. The number of years used has ranged\nfrom 1 to 150. A review of 45 prior studies, listed in Table S1, assessing the impact of climate change on\nPM2.5, or particulate matter components, reveals that over half used \ufb01ve years or less of simulated air quality\nto represent present or future climates and 85% relied on 10 years or less. Such simulation lengths may be\ninsuf\ufb01cient to adequately separate an anthropogenic\u2010forced signal from natural variability. Analyses bene-\n\ufb01ting from large simulations focused on ozone (O3) pollution have shown that multidecadal simulations\nare required to isolate the impact of climate change and may be unable to do so before midcentury\n(Barnes et al., 2016; Garcia\u2010Menendez et al., 2017). However, the in\ufb02uence of natural variability on PM2.5,\nthe pollutant potentially responsible for the majority of health costs associated with the \u201cclimate penalty\u201d\non air quality (Garcia\u2010Menendez et al., 2015; Silva et al., 2017), has not been speci\ufb01cally assessed. Some\nrecent efforts to project the impacts of twenty\u2010\ufb01rst\u2010century climate change on PM2.5 have moved toward lar-\nger numbers of modeled years through multidecadal and ensemble simulations (Lacressonni\u00e8re et al., 2016;\nWestervelt et al., 2016; Xu & Lamarque, 2018). These highlight the in\ufb02uence natural variability can have on\nprojections of climate change impacts. However, other recent studies, especially those applying regional cli-\nmate and chemical transport models, have continued to rely on a small number of years to identify an\nanthropogenic\u2010forced climate signal in PM2.5 concentrations, even at midcentury or earlier (Table S1).\nShorter simulations are a trade\u2010off that may be necessary to address other sources of uncertainty in projec-\ntions, such as resolution, emissions, and atmospheric process representations.\nHere we weigh the in\ufb02uence of natural variability on estimates of climate change impacts on PM2.5 pollution\nby analyzing the projections of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Climate Change Impacts\nand Risk Analysis project (U.S. EPA, 2015; Waldhoff et al., 2015). The ensemble simulations at the core of the\nClimate Change Impacts and Risk Analysis projections represent a signi\ufb01cant effort to model climate\u2010\ninduced air quality impacts, with over a thousand years of modeled atmospheric chemistry. Based on this\nensemble we compare the in\ufb02uence of natural variability on projections of climate change impacts on\nPM2.5 to those for O3 and recommend a minimum simulation length to provide guidance to future analyses\nattempting to model anthropogenic\u2010forced, climate\u2010related variations in PM2.5 pollution.\n2. Methods\nWe simulate the impacts of climate change on PM2.5 pollution under three integrated climate, policy, and\neconomic activity scenarios developed with the MIT Integrated Global System Model linked to the\nCommunity Atmosphere Model (MIT IGSM\u2010CAM; Monier et al., 2013). The scenarios project global eco-\nnomic activity, greenhouse gas emissions, and climate under a reference case with no climate change miti-\ngation policy in which total radiative forcing reaches 10 W/m2 at the end of the century (REF), a climate\npolicy that stabilizes total radiative forcing at 4.5 W/m2 by 2100 (P45), and a climate policy that stabilizes\ntotal radiative forcing at 3.7 W/m2 by 2100 (P37). Details about the socioeconomic greenhouse gas emission\nprojections are presented in Paltsev et al. (2015). The scenarios have been used to assess climate change\nimpacts and mitigation bene\ufb01ts across a diverse range of sectors in the United States (U.S. EPA, 2015).\nThe ability of the MIT IGSM\u2010CAM model to represent historical atmospheric conditions and variability\nhas been evaluated against station\u2010 and model\u2010based observational data sets (Monier et al., 2013). Relative\nto observational data from 1900 to 2010, the MIT IGSM\u2010CAM realistically simulates major climate variables,\nincluding surface air temperature and precipitation, as well as year\u2010to\u2010year climate variability (Monier et al.,\n2013). A detailed discussion of the MIT IGSM\u2010CAM's climate projections over the United States for the sce-\nnarios considered here is included in Monier et al. (2015).\nWe simulate air quality under each climate policy scenario using the Community Atmosphere Model with\nChemistry (CAM\u2010Chem, version 1.1.2; Lamarque et al., 2012). Meteorological \ufb01elds generated by the MIT\nIGSM\u2010CAM are used to drive CAM\u2010Chem simulations at 1.9\u00b0 \u00d7 2.5\u00b0 resolution. In all CAM\u2010Chem atmo-\nspheric chemistry simulations, anthropogenic emissions are \ufb01xed at start\u2010of\u2010the\u2010century levels (2000) to iso-\nlate the effect of climate on air quality. The anthropogenic emissions used are described in Lamarque et al.\n10.1029/2019EF001195Earth's Future\nPIENKOSZ ET AL. 763\n(2012) and based on the Precursors of Ozone and their Effects in the Troposphere inventory. The response of\nbiogenic emissions of isoprene and monoterpenes to variations in temperature is modeled; however, the\neffects of climate on other natural emissions sources, including wild\ufb01res and dust emissions, are not\nincluded. In CAM\u2010Chem, secondary organic aerosol (SOA) production is represented by a two\u2010product\nscheme that links SOA formation to oxidation of atmospheric nonmethane hydrocarbons (Lamarque\net al., 2012). Here we assess climate\u2010induced impacts on ground\u2010level concentrations of sulfate (SO4), ammo-\nnium nitrate (NH4NO3), organic aerosol (OA), and black carbon (BC) particles, and estimate PM2.5 mass fol-\nlowing Val Martin et al. (2014). CAM\u2010Chem has been previously used to model air quality and its ability to\nreplicate surface concentrations of different aerosol species is evaluated against surface observations in\nLamarque et al. (2012). Additional details and discussion about the CAM\u2010Chem simulations and\nensemble\u2010mean PM2.5 projections used here are included in Garcia\u2010Menendez et al. (2015). Over the\nUnited States, the model captures the distribution of major PM2.5 components but shows a positive bias\nfor SO4 and underpredicts observed concentrations of EC and OA. On average, SO4 and OA are the largest\ncontributors to total modeled PM2.5, followed by NH4NO3 and a signi\ufb01cantly smaller fraction of EC. The\nsimulated annual population\u2010weighted PM2.5 concentration at the start\u2010of\u2010the century, 12.6 \u03bcg/m\n3, is close\nto EPA's reported national annual PM2.5 concentration averaged across over 400 monitoring sites (mostly\nurban) in 2000, equal to 13.5 \u03bcg/m3 (U.S. EPA, 2017).\nThe analyses described in this study focus on the meteorology\u2010related impacts of climate change on PM2.5\npollution. The impact of climate change on ambient PM2.5 (i.e., the PM2.5 \u201cclimate penalty\u201d) over the con-\ntiguous United States is assessed by estimating the difference between simulated ground\u2010level concentra-\ntions under start\u2010of\u2010the\u2010century and future climates. To capture natural interannual variability, we\nsimulate U.S. air quality at the beginning, middle, and end of the twenty\u2010\ufb01rst century using 30\u2010year model-\ning periods (1981\u20132010, 2036\u20132065, and 2086\u20132115). To further account for multidecadal natural variability\nwithin our projections, we model atmospheric chemistry during each period with \ufb01ve different representa-\ntions of natural variability generated by perturbing initial atmospheric, land, and ocean conditions in the\nMIT IGSM\u2010CAM climate change simulations (Monier et al., 2013). To evaluate the impact of anthropogenic\nclimate change at midcentury and the end of the century against natural variability within simulated peri-\nods, externally forced climate change is controlled by detrending annual\u2010average concentrations within each\n30\u2010year interval and centering air quality impacts in 2050 and 2100. Detrending was conducted for each grid\ncell by computing the least squares \ufb01t of a straight line to the data and subtracting the resulting function\nfrom the annual\u2010average concentrations. PM2.5 pollution under each policy scenario considered and present\nor future climates is therefore characterized by 150 years of simulated air quality. The ensemble\u2010mean pro-\njections of climate\u2010induced changes in PM2.5 were used to evaluate health and economic impacts in EPA's\nClimate Change Impacts and Risk Analysis project (U.S. EPA, 2015). However, the underlying ensemble\nsimulations, which include 1,050 years of simulated air quality, allow for a close inspection of the in\ufb02uence\nof natural variability in projections of climate change impacts on PM2.5. The role of natural variability on U.\nS. O3 pollution was assessed in Garcia\u2010Menendez et al. (2017), \ufb01nding that natural variability signi\ufb01cantly\naffects projections of climate change impacts and recommending a 15\u2010year simulation minimum to ade-\nquately identify an anthropogenic\u2010forced signal at a national scale. Uncertainty related to natural variability\nis compared to that associated with national\u2010scale health and economic impacts in Saari et al. (2019). Here\nwe extend the analysis to explore the role of natural variability in projections of the meteorology\u2010driven\nimpacts of climate change on PM2.5 pollution.\n3. Results and Discussion\nOur simulations of atmospheric chemistry under future climate show a signi\ufb01cant penalty on U.S. PM2.5 pol-\nlution (Figure 1). Ensemble\u2010mean projections estimate a climate\u2010induced increase in U.S. annual\npopulation\u2010weighted PM2.5 of 0.5 \u00b1 0.1 \u03bcg/m\n3 by midcentury and 1.5 \u00b1 0.1 \u03bcg/m3 by the end of the century\nunder the REF scenario (statistical signi\ufb01cance evaluated with a Student's t test for 95% con\ufb01dence). The lar-\ngest regional penalty is projected over the eastern United States, with lesser increases simulated in the West\nand small climate\u2010induced decreases in PM2.5 anticipated over some areas of the Midwest. The simulated\nchanges re\ufb02ect multiple pathways through which meteorology in\ufb02uences PM2.5 concentrations, including\nincreased SO2 oxidation and nitrate partitioning to the gas phase under warmer temperatures, higher\n10.1029/2019EF001195Earth's Future\nPIENKOSZ ET AL. 764\nstagnation, and variations in precipitation, consistent with previous studies analyzing the linkages between\nclimate and air quality (Fiore et al., 2012). The interactions within these ensemble simulations and impacts\non different PM2.5 components are further discussed in Garcia\u2010Menendez et al. (2015). Although model\nbiases in\ufb02uence predicted PM2.5 concentrations, these affect simulations under both start\u2010of\u2010the\u2010century\nand future climates. Thus, penalties estimated as the difference between future and present air quality\naccount for the biases to the degree that they remain consistent across modeled periods.\nProjected PM2.5 increases associated with climate change are largely driven by SO4, particularly in the east-\nern United States, and to a smaller extent OA. Climate impacts on OA, including SOA, are largest over the\nregions in Southeast, Northeast, and western United States. While these changes re\ufb02ect a climate\u2010driven\nincrease in SOA biogenic precursors, SOA summertime production is likely underestimated by the represen-\ntation of SOA formation in CAM\u2010Chem (Lamarque et al., 2012). These increments are countered by climate\ndriven reductions in NH4NO3, which is responsible for the projected drop in PM2.5 over areas of the\nMidwest. The climate penalty on PM2.5 is greatly reduced by climate change mitigation policies. Over 80%\nof the REF\u2010scenario penalty on annual population\u2010weighted PM2.5 at the end of the century is avoided under\nthe P37 scenario.\nDepending on the region, our projections agree or contrast to varying degrees with recent studies simulating\nclimate change impacts on PM2.5. For example, our simulations are consistent with the projections of Nolte\net al. (2018) over the southeastern United States, suggesting a climate\u2010induced increase in OA, but differ in\nthe magnitude of the nitrate\u2010driven decrease in concentrations over the Midwest. In contrast, Westervelt\net al. (2016) project an end\u2010of\u2010century climate penalty on PM2.5 over most of the United States under a\nhigh\u2010emission scenario, which, as in our projections, is strongest over the Northeast and Midwest. Similar\nto our projections, the simulations of Xu and Lamarque (2018) suggest that climate\u2010induced PM2.5 changes\nmay be driven by SO4, with signi\ufb01cant impacts over the Northeast. The level of agreement with these studies,\nand over 40 others listed in Table S1, is expected given the inconsistencies reported in model\u2010based projec-\ntions of the climate penalty on PM2.5 pollution. Large uncertainties associated with climate model response\nto greenhouse gas and aerosol concentrations can propagate to projections of climate change impacts,\nincluding air pollution. Additionally, differences in greenhouse gas scenarios, air pollutant emissions, spatial\nresolution, time periods, PM2.5 components considered, processes simulated, and others can make direct\ncomparisons across projections dif\ufb01cult.\nThe ensemble\u2010mean projections re\ufb02ect estimates based on 150 years of underlying simulations representing\nclimate and atmospheric chemistry at the start, middle, and end of the twenty\u2010\ufb01rst century. However, each\nensemble\u2010mean representation of present or future air quality encompasses ensemble members exhibiting\nsubstantial natural variability. This variability is illustrated in Figure 2, which contrasts climate penalties\nFigure 1. Climate penalty on U.S. PM2.5 pollution. Ensemble\u2010mean climate\u2010induced change in annual\u2010average PM2.5 from the beginning of the century to 2050\nand 2100 under REF, P45, and P37 scenarios.\n10.1029/2019EF001195Earth's Future\nPIENKOSZ ET AL. 765\non PM2.5 in 2100 under the REF scenario estimated from pairwise combinations of individual present and\nfuture annual simulations. Depending on the individual years used to assess the in\ufb02uence of climate on\nPM2.5 concentrations, impacts higher than +5 \u03bcg/m\n3 or lower than \u22124 \u03bcg/m3 may be projected to occur\nat the same location. The variability in simulated PM2.5 climate impacts is largely driven by variability in\nthe SO4 particulate matter component. Estimating the climate penalty from years with meteorology that\nis particularly conducive or unfavorable to PM2.5 pollution leads to projections that range from a\nsigni\ufb01cant increase in concentrations across the entire United States to others predicting a climate\u2010induced\nreduction over most of the country. Natural variability is especially evident in the eastern United States and\nMidwest, which, driven by SO4, have the largest mean climate impacts (+1.9 and +1.1 \u03bcg/m\n3, respectively),\nas well as the greatest interannual variations (standard deviations of 1.2 and 1.0 \u03bcg/m3, respectively). The\nanthropogenic\u2010forced signal in air quality can be differentiated from natural variability using multiyear\nsimulations or initial condition ensembles. Figure 2 also shows average climate penalty projections under\neach of the \ufb01ve model initializations included in our ensemble simulations. When 30 years of atmospheric\nchemistry are used to represent present and future air quality, projections under all initializations resemble\nthe ensemble\u2010mean climate penalty projection.\nWe \ufb01nd that con\ufb01dently identifying an anthropogenic\u2010forced climate change signal in U.S. air quality may\nbe challenging at midcentury or under climate stabilization policies. Relying on a limited characterization of\nnatural variability in present and future air quality can lead to climate penalty estimates that disagree with\nthe ensemble\u2010mean projection. Close to all penalties (>90%) calculated by pairing single present and future\nannual simulations suggest a climate\u2010induced increase in U.S. pollution by 2100 under the REF scenario.\nHowever, only about 70% of the REF\u2010scenario single\u2010year estimates project a PM2.5 penalty at midcentury.\nAlthough the ensemble\u2010mean projections under the P45 and P37 scenarios suggest an overall increase in\nPM2.5 concentrations driven by climate change, 30% to 40% of the estimates derived from individual years\nFigure 2. Natural variability in projected PM2.5 climate change impacts. The ensemble\u2010mean 2100 climate change impact on annual\u2010average PM2.5 estimated\nunder REF scenario is shown in the top left panel. Impacts estimated under each speci\ufb01c climate model initialization and 30\u2010year present and future simula-\ntions are shown in the \ufb01ve midsized panels. Samples of projections estimated from one\u2010year present/future simulation pairs are shown in the 45 smaller panels.\n10.1029/2019EF001195Earth's Future\nPIENKOSZ ET AL. 766\nunder these scenarios re\ufb02ect a climate \u201cbene\ufb01t\u201d on population\u2010weighted concentrations, which does not\nre\ufb02ect the true policy impact.\nSeparating the climate change signal from natural variability in estimates of the climate penalty on air qual-\nity requires an adequate simulation length. The degree to which natural variability must be attenuated will\ndepend on each study's objectives and design. Previously reported estimates of the impact of climate change\non PM2.5 in the United States are as large as few microgram per cubic meter, frequently close to or smaller\nthan \u00b11 \u03bcg/m3 (Fiore et al., 2015). In our ensemble simulations, estimating the REF\u2010scenario end\u2010of\u2010century\nclimate penalty on U.S. population\u2010weighted PM2.5 at national scale with a \u00b10.5\u2010\u03bcg/m\n3 margin of error at\n95% con\ufb01dence requires eight present and future years of simulated atmospheric chemistry. At a regional\nlevel, a larger number of simulation years can be necessary to attain the same level of con\ufb01dence in projected\nregional air quality penalties, with over 20 paired years required for the Northeast. Table 1 lists the number\nof simulation years required to project climate penalties with a speci\ufb01edmargin of error over the U.S. regions\nmost heavily in\ufb02uenced by natural variability, the Northeast, Midwest, and Southeast.\nAdditionally, a margin of error of \u00b10.5 \u03bcg/m3 may be inadequate for projections at midcentury, under cli-\nmate stabilization scenarios, or regions with smaller effects, where estimated climate change impacts on\nPM2.5 are close to or lower than 0.5 \u03bcg/m\n3. Decreasing the margin of error in projections to \u00b10.25 \u03bcg/m3\nentails a signi\ufb01cantly larger number of simulations. For the REF scenario end\u2010of\u2010century penalty on U.S.\npopulation\u2010weighted PM2.5 pollution, this would require increasing the paired years simulated to nearly\n30. Reducing overcon\ufb01dence in a simulated estimate of a climate penalty can be achieved by increasing\nthe extent of both temporal and spatial averaging to strengthen signal detection under the noise of natural\nvariability (Brown\u2010Steiner et al., 2018).\nBased on our results, we recommend using a minimum of 10 years of simulated climate and atmospheric\nchemistry to constrain natural variability in modeled present and future air quality for analyses attempting\nto quantify the climate penalty on PM2.5 pollution at a national or larger scale. For regional or local projec-\ntions, our results suggest carefully weighing the degree of natural variability at the relevant scale to ensure\nthe robustness of reported climate penalty estimates. Furthermore, these estimates are derived from a che-\nmical composition of PM2.5 that may vary under changing anthropogenic emissions. In our projections, SO4\nand NH4NO3 display the strongest responses to climate change. As the fraction of OA in PM2.5 increases, the\nmagnitude of the climate penalty may decrease. However, similar coef\ufb01cients of variation (~35%) for the\nsimulated penalties on population\u2010weighted SO4, NH4NO3, and OA concentrations suggest that an extended\nsimulation length will still be necessary to separate an anthropogenic\u2010forced signal, albeit a smaller one,\nfrom natural variability. While this study simulates the impact of climate change on emitted pollutants, it\ndoes not project its effect on wild\ufb01re and dust emissions, which are sensitive to variations in meteorology\nand highly susceptible to natural variability (Achakulwisut et al., 2018; Mills et al., 2015; Yue et al., 2013).\nConsidering these natural emission sources would likely increase the amount of modeling required to cap-\nture the anthropogenic\u2010forced climate impact on PM2.5.\nIn several efforts to model the climate penalty on air quality, simulations have been used to simultaneously\nproject impacts on both PM2.5 and O3. As previously described, in our ensemble simulations a set of \ufb01ve\nmodel initializations across which climate forcings are equal but the simulations' initial state, represented\nin the ocean, land and atmosphere, is different is used to capture natural variability beyond multidecadal\nTable 1\nMargin of Error in Projections of Climate Change Impacts on PM2.5\nEnsemble\u2010mean climate penalty Margin of error Simulation years required\nU.S. population\u2010weighted 1.5 \u03bcg/m3 \u00b10.5 \u03bcg/m3 8\n\u00b10.25 \u03bcg/m3 29\nNortheast 1.9 \u03bcg/m3 \u00b10.5 \u03bcg/m3 23\nMidwest 1.1 \u03bcg/m3 \u00b10.5 \u03bcg/m3 16\nSoutheast 1.0 \u03bcg/m3 \u00b10.5 \u03bcg/m3 9\nNote.

Ensemble\u2010mean PM2.5 impacts are also listed. Regions\nincluded correspond to those de\ufb01ned in the 2018 U.S. National Climate Assessment (Reidmiller et al., 2018).\n10.1029/2019EF001195Earth's Future\nPIENKOSZ ET AL. 767\nsimulations (Monier et al., 2013). For each initialization, Figure 3 shows how climate penalty estimates vary\nas the simulation length used to characterize present and future air quality is increased from 1 to 30 years.\nWhile the climate penalties on PM2.5 pollution projected under each initialization can differ substantially for\nshort model runs, as the simulation length approaches 10 years, mean projections for each initialization\nconverge to a similar anthropogenic\u2010forced impact. Compared to our previous study focused on O3\npollution (Garcia\u2010Menendez et al., 2017), we \ufb01nd that the variability of PM2.5 impacts relative to mean\nconcentrations is larger. Although our recommended minimum simulation length for PM2.5 climate\nimpact assessments is lower than our previous 15\u2010year recommendation for impacts on O3 pollution, the\nmargins of error on which these are based (0.5 \u03bcg/m3 for PM2.5 and 1.5 ppb for O3) usually represent a\nlarger fraction of the ensemble\u2010mean penalties projected for PM2.5 compared to those for O3.\n4. Conclusion and Implications\nEven after over a decade of research progress there is still little consistency among projections of the climate\npenalty on PM2.5 (Reidmiller et al., 2018). To identify the causes of the discrepancies and reduce the uncer-\ntainty in these estimates, it is critical that simulations adequately consider natural variability in attributing\nchanges in PM2.5 concentrations to anthropogenic climate change. While executing large\u2010ensemble simula-\ntions with computationally expensive or high\u2010resolution models may be challenging, strategically combin-\ning temporal and spatial averaging can add robustness to projections (Brown\u2010Steiner et al., 2018). Our\nresults show that, as with O3, natural variability has a signi\ufb01cant in\ufb02uence on estimates of climate\u2010induced\nchanges in PM2.5. Based on our ensemble simulations, we recommend using 10 years or more in efforts to\nmodel climate impacts on U.S. PM2.5 at a national scale with a \u00b10.5\u2010\u03bcg/m\n3 margin of error. Further model-\ning was required tomeet the same threshold for smaller\u2010scale projections. It is also important to note that the\nlevel of variability in climate projections is model\u2010dependent and additional analyses may be necessary to\nweigh the in\ufb02uence of natural variability for different modeling frameworks. While our 10\u2010year recommen-\ndation is drawn from a single model and a speci\ufb01c set of socioeconomic and climate scenarios, we believe\nthat it can add con\ufb01dence to reported projections and encourage closer inspection of natural variability in\nfuture efforts to simulate the climate penalty on air quality.\nAdditional sources of uncertainty beyond natural variability affect projections of PM2.5 under climate\nchange. Our analysis focuses on the effect of climate on PM2.5. Future air quality will be determined by\nthe combined effect of climate change and changes in anthropogenic emissions, which are likely to have a\nlarger effect than the penalty associated with variations in meteorology. Emission changes can also impact\nthe chemical composition and spatial distribution of PM2.5 pollution, in\ufb02uencing its response to climate and\nthe level of natural variability inherent to the climate penalty on air quality. However, our results support\nconcerns that climate change has the potential to degrade air quality gains from pollutant emission reduc-\ntions, with signi\ufb01cant consequences for human health.\nFigure 3. Variability in climate change impact on PM2.5 and O3 pollution. The 2100 REF\u2010scenario climate impact on U.S.\u2010\naverage, U.S. population\u2010weighted, and Northeast\u2010average annual ground\u2010level PM2.5 and daily maximum 8\u2010hr O3,\nexpressed as relative change with respect to start\u2010of\u2010century mean concentrations. Climate impacts are estimated using\n\ufb01ve climate model initializations (denoted by solid lines) and simulation lengths increasing from 1 to 30 years. Shaded\nregions indicate the margin of error for each estimate at a 95% con\ufb01dence level based on the 30\u2010year sample standard\ndeviation.\n10.1029/2019EF001195Earth's Future\nPIENKOSZ ET AL. 768\nModel uncertainty in climate and atmospheric chemistry simulations is another important contributor to\noverall uncertainty in PM2.5 projections, as evidenced by the signi\ufb01cant differences across members of multi-\nmodel ensembles (Allen et al., 2016; Lacressonni\u00e8re et al., 2016; Silva et al., 2017). Unlike model or emission\nuncertainty, the noise from natural variability can be \ufb01ltered out with extended modeling, allowing simula-\ntions to successfully detect the impact of emission policies. Reducing uncertainty associated with natural\nvariability would also complement modeling efforts targeting other sources of uncertainty in projections\nof air quality under climate change, such as spatial resolution or atmospheric process representations.\nFurthermore, the uncertainty in estimates of climate\u2010induced air quality impacts can propagate to projec-\ntions of health damages and economic costs included in climate policy assessments, where the uncertainties\nassociated with modeling health impacts and their economic valuation may be larger still (Heo et al., 2016;\nMatus et al., 2012; Saari et al., 2019). The use of decadal or ensemble simulations to better capture natural\nviability can reduce overall uncertainty in integrated climate change mitigation analyses, allowing them\nto inform climate policy discussions more effectively.\nReferences\nAchakulwisut, P., Mickley, L.

Introduction  Climate change has emerged as the dominant global environmental change issue of the past decade driven by scientific observations and model outputs, projections of severe socio-economic impacts, coupled with widespread public and political concern. Addressing both the causes and effects of climate change is proving to be challenging, as the climate change negotiations in Copenhagen (December 2009) and Durban (December 2011) testified; however, considerable global attention and scientific effort is currently channelled towards the climate change conference in Paris in 2015.  Research on climate change in relation to marine ecosystems has been relatively limited. For example, the Fourth Assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change noted 28,586 significant biological changes in terrestrial systems but only 85 in marine and freshwater systems (IPCC, 2007a,b; Richardson and Poloczanska, 2008). As of late 2011, of 84,723 scientific papers published on climate change, only 6,624 (7.8%) dealt with marine climate change despite the fact that oceans represent 70% of the Earth\u2019s surface (Heip, 2011). Research in this area is progressing, resulting partly in greater focus on marine climate impacts in the IPCC\u2019s recent Fifth Assessment Report, which highlighted the \u201crisk of loss of marine and coastal ecosystems, biodiversity, and the ecosystem goods, functions, and services\u201d (IPCC, 2014: 12).  Not only are marine and coastal environments crucial in mediating changes in the Earth\u2019s climatic system (Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 et al., 2009), scientific evidence shows they also stand to bear severe marine climate change impacts. These range from natural and physical ocean changes in sea-level, temperature, circulation, acidification, and species distribution; coastal erosion and flooding; through to impacts on fisheries, tourism and transport (see Heip et al., 2011; Philippart et al., 2011). Research indicates that such impacts could lead to major socio-economic changes. For instance, fisheries are projected to lose yields in low latitude countries and possibly benefit in higher latitudes (Cheung et al. 2010). Costs of a 44cm sea level rise across Europe have been estimated at \u20ac12billion per year in 2100 (Hinkel et al. 2010), with changes in sea level being associated with inundation of land and population displacement (Tol, 2007).   In relative terms, the lesser attention to marine climate change impacts in natural scientific research is mirrored in research on the social dimensions of climate change. While there is now a substantial body of research on the ways in which publics understand and perceive climate change more generally (e.g. Lorenzoni et al., 2006; Whitmarsh, 2009; Brechin and Bhandari, 2014), how this is mediated through cultural values and worldviews, media discourses and trust in science and institutions (Poortinga and Pidgeon, 2003; Carvalho and Burgess, 2005; Lorenzoni et al., 2006; Wolf [Pre-print - authors\u2019 accepted manuscript version.

Most human populations are indirectly, if not directly, at risk from marine climate change impacts, which stand to intensify through time and demand robust adaptation responses alongside attempts to build the resilience of natural and social systems (Adger et al., 2009). Such responses will in part depend on a deeper understanding of how publics perceive, engage with and respond to marine climate change issues in their own terms if they are to be sustainable (cf. Irwin and Wynne, 1996).  To date, much research into public perceptions of, and responses to, marine climate change impacts has focussed on single hazards or impacts (although see Harvatt et al., 2011) with emphasis on exploring immediate or tangible issues of sea-level rise (e.g. Myatt-Bell et al., 2002; Van Koningsveld et al., 2008), associated coastal flooding (e.g. Zsamboky et al., 2011) and coastal erosion (e.g. Dolan and Walker, 2006). More recent work has begun to cover the diversity of marine climate change impacts outlined above in both developed and developing country contexts. Carlton and Jacobson (2013) explored perceptions of less visible impacts of climate change, finding that (in line with other literature) climate change risks are multiple and perceived differently by individuals, who understand these through experiential processing. Studies have also explored perceptions of coastal hazards in relation to climate change and livelihoods in the global South (e.g. Bunce et al., 2010; Linnekamp et al., 2011; Combest-Friedman et al., 2012).  In order to address these gaps in global environmental change research this paper reports on a study that is novel in that it explores public engagement across multiple marine climate impacts and includes the first large-scale public survey on the subject. This wider study sought to better understand how publics perceive, engage with and respond to marine climate change issues across Europe (also see Gelcich et al. in press). In this paper we focus on findings from the UK, which was the sole country of the European study where in-depth qualitative research was conducted in addition to the quantitative survey (see the Methodology section below). The paper thus aims to offer new insights into how publics frame, understand and respond to marine climate change-related issues through a UK focused mixed-method analysis.  The UK is an important cultural-political setting in which to study how publics relate to marine climate change issues. The UK operates within a strong legislative framework aiming to address the causes an[Pre-print - authors\u2019 accepted manuscript version.

Since 2008, the UK Climate Change Act provides a national framework for achieving long-term mitigation (80% reduction of national greenhouse gas emissions by 2050) and fostering adaptation. The nation\u2019s first Climate Change Risk Assessment (DEFRA, 2012) indicates that:   \u201caround 3000 km (17%) of the UK coast is currently eroding. Climate change may lead to a 100% to 400% increase in erosion rate, compared with the current rate. While still affecting only a very small proportion of the UK\u2019s total land area, locally this might have significant implications for communities and habitats\u201d.    Indeed the UK has a long legacy of dealing with the well-recognised threat of coastal erosion and flooding. For over 50 years investment has focused on engineering options often resulting in hard defences protecting the coastline, with allowances for climate change applied since the 1990s.  The overall approach to flood risk management over the past decade has placed more emphasis on reducing financial investment in flood defences, including flood risk considerations in planning decisions and fostering social resilience to change. However, stakeholder interests continue to favour structural approaches to flood risk protection (Harries and Penning-Rowsell, 2011).  The UK public has generally reported high awareness and concern about climate change, although scepticism has been growing since about 2006 (e.g. Spence et al., 2010a). In this population, experience of flooding has been shown in some studies to be directly related to willingness to take personal action (Harvatt et al., 2011) and especially to mitigate through energy reduction (Spence et al., 2010a).  Flooding experience has been found to correlate with higher concern about climate change and belief in the efficacy of individual behaviours (Spence et al., 2011).  The next section reviews existing research into how the public understand and engage with marine climate change issues. We then present the main findings and three distinctive contributions of our UK survey coupled with in-depth qualitative research. First, we analyse how UK public participants defined and framed marine climate change issues in their own terms. Second, we explore findings on public understandings and knowledges with respect to marine climate change. Third we outline public views on responses with respect to mitigation and adaptation. In the final discussion and conclusion section, we draw together key findings from across these sections, reflect on them in relation to the existing literature, and consider implications for future research and practices of public engagement with marine climate change issues.

Background  Few studies have directly addressed how publics understand and engage with marine climate change issues, although the literature has recently expanded in this area. In this section we briefly review these specific studies and gain further insight into these dynamics from work on perceptions of climate change and how publics relate to marine environments more generally. We also consider diverse forms of public participation and engagement on these issues. We define \u2018public engagement\u2019 broadly in terms of the various ways in which people relate to climate change-related issues in general and marine climate change in particular. This combines definitions of public engagement as an individual\u2019s state of knowledge, values and behaviour relating to climate change (e.g. Lorenzoni et al. 2007), with those that emphasise collective forms of public engagement in policy making, science, forms of activism, and social innovation (e.g. Kasemir et al., 2003; Felt and Wynne, 2007; Wynne, 2007; Chilvers, 2008; Callon et al 2009).  For the purpose of this paper we use the term \u2018publics\u2019 deliberately to acknowledge the diversity and plurality of publics as opposed to more traditional conceptions of \u2018the public\u2019 as a homogeneous entity (cf. Irwin and Wynne, 1996).  Among the limited number of studies exploring public engagement with marine climate change impacts, most focus rather narrowly on personal and social risk perceptions of particular impacts.  Small scale surveys in the UK, USA and Sweden (Lorenzoni et al., 2006, Sundblad et al., 2007) and research with vulnerable communities in the UK (Bickerstaff et al., 2006) indicate that sea level rise, coastal flooding and erosion are associated with climate change by the public at large, but these have limited personal salience. Similarly, the limited evidence on engagement with less publicly-visible impacts, such as ocean acidification, suggests that these are psychologically distant (personally irrelevant, emotionally unengaging, e.g. O\u2019Neill and Hulme, 2009). Evidence with regards to the influence of direct experience of flooding on engagement with climate change is contradictory: some studies suggest it enhances the connection with, and awareness of, climate change risks (see Harvatt et al 2011; Spence et al. 2011; Zsamboky et al 2011), whilst other empirical work does not support this relationship (e.g. Whitmarsh, 2008). More recently, a survey of Irish citizens\u2019 attitudes to marine environments suggested that their views on the most significant threats do not for the most part correspond with those of expert or scientific communities (Hyne et al., 2014).  The small number of studies which consider public reactions to climate change mitigation initiatives in or under the sea offer useful insights into understanding how changes to marine environments are perceived. Exploration of perceptions of wind and tidal energies in relation to aesthetic values and place (Haggett, 2008; McLachlan, 2009; Gee, 2010; Devine-Wright and Howes, 2010; Devine-Wright, 2011) and Shackley et al.\u2019s (2005) study on public reactions to carbon capture and storage [Pre-print - authors\u2019 accepted manuscript version.

Available at: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2014.09.006]  \t\t 6 illustrate strong personal connections to marine and coastal environments, affected by sense of aesthetics, practical considerations (livelihoods, impact on marine wildlife, national energy production), proximity and the \u2018nature\u2019 of the environment (e.g. as a source of life to be respected). Some individuals view marine environments as areas to be protected from human \u2018pollution\u2019 for moral as well as practical reasons, for example for the various services they provide (see also Fletcher et al. 2009, as well as Mee et al.\u2019s (2008) re-analysis of Eurobarometer surveys on citizens\u2019 concerns in relation to marine environments).   Among the wide body of literature concerning public engagement with climate change, findings consistently indicate \u2013 as elucidated here using the example of a 2009 European survey - a generally informed European public on the causes (56% of respondents) and consequences (56%) of climate change and ways of addressing it (52%), although the proportion of citizens that feel poorly informed about the subject remains significant, at 9% (data reported by the European Commission and European Parliament, 2009). Furthermore, in this survey most Europeans declared high concern about climate change, with 67% viewing it as a \u2018very serious issue\u2019. Smaller surveys within individual EU nations also show high levels of concern (e.g. Paeth and Otto, 2009; Spence et al., 2010b; Whitmarsh, 2011). In the UK a decline in public concern since 2006 has been documented (see Spence et al., 2010a), although its attribution remains difficult to define. On the other hand, while climate change is viewed as an important issue it is generally perceived as less important than certain other global problems. For the most part individuals in developed nations perceive climate change as a serious but remote risk, although examination by Spence and colleagues (2012) reveals that among the British population this is more nuanced. Respondents in their study perceived climate change as both psychologically distant and close, in space and time, which  may be influenced by the perceived significance or magnitude of impact (suggesting a relationship between concern about climate change and psychological distance). Risk perceptions are an important but limited contributor to engagement. This is dependent on individuals\u2019 sense of being capable of responding (i.e. perceived self-efficacy, e.g. Grothmann and Patt 2005; Lorenzoni et al., 2007; Harvatt et al., 2011) and trust in institutions (Poortinga and Pidgeon 2003; Van Koningsveld et al., 2008; Malka et al., 2009).   Processes encouraging public discussion on climate change impacts have been employed in attempts to raise awareness of the risks and the range of alternative responses. For example, some researchers advocate increased use of participatory deliberation in order to foster people\u2019s sense of self-efficacy (Brody et al., 2008) or move beyond the entrenched positions associated with different values and worldviews (Verweij et al., 2006; Shwom et al., 2010; Whitmarsh, 2011). Deliberative public [Pre-print - authors\u2019 accepted manuscript version. Please cite as the published version: Chilvers, J., Lorenzoni, I., Terry, G., Buckley, P., Pinnegar, J.K. & Gelcich, S. (2014) \u2018Public engagement with marine climate change issues: (Re)framings, understandings and responses\u2019, Global Environmental Change 29: 165-179. Available at: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2014.09.006]  \t\t 7 engagement processes can include invited participatory assessments and \u2018citizen science\u2019 initiatives which provide spaces to which members of the public and stakeholders are invited, sometimes being specially selected for the purpose (e.g. ATLANTIS project on sea level rise, Lonsdale et al., 2008; Bunce et al., 2010 on perceptions of climate change on African coasts), through to \u2018uninvited spaces\u2019 (Wynne, 2007; Chilvers and Evans, 2009) in which members of the public respond to marine environmental issues in diverse ways either on their own initiative or through civil society organisations. Recent campaigns suggest that there is substantial public concern for marine environmental issues beyond a narrow focus on risk to humans, as seen for example through Greenpeace\u2019s Defending Our Oceans campaign (e.g. Greenpeace, 2010) and British celebrity chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall\u2019s Fish Fight campaign against the EU\u2019s Common Fisheries Policy (which over 870,000 people across 195 countries worldwide signed the petition for - see www.fishfight.net). Such instances of public advocacy indicate considerable interest among individuals to engage with marine environmental and climate change issues on their own terms. There is likely to be a wide diversity of legitimate stakeholder perspectives and instances of public engagement on coastal and marine issues that need to be given a voice in shaping future actions and developing a vision of a \u2018sea interest\u2019 (Ritchie and Ellis, 2010; Van Koningsveld et al., 2008).     3. Methodology  A mixed-method research design was employed in the current study. It integrated (i) a large national survey, which gained insights into what a nationally representative sample of 1,001 UK members of the public think about marine climate change issues, with (ii) in-depth qualitative research in the form of a deliberative workshop which involved a select group of 20 citizens from the UK East Anglian region exploring the underlying factors shaping public understandings and responses. The two methods explored similar themes and the resulting data were analysed in conjunction. The survey research provides data on what a wider population of UK public respondents think about marine climate change issues but - in keeping with the limits of questionnaire-based approaches - gives limited insight into why this is the case. The purpose of the in-depth qualitative research, undertaken after the large-scale survey, was to explore public views on these why questions in more depth, to reveal the underlying reasonings, factors and concerns that shape public understandings and responses to marine climate change issues. Such triangulation of distinct-but-linked methods can enhance the richness and robustness of the analytical findings presented (Jick, 1979; Bryman, 2004). It is important to note, however, that the in-depth qualitative research did not seek to be \u2018representative\u2019 [Pre-print - authors\u2019 accepted manuscript version.

It comprised a questionnaire structured into three sections. The first section sought to explore public framings of marine climate change impacts set in the wider context of marine environmental issues and climate change more generally. The second section explored public knowledge of marine climate impacts, information sources, and questions of trust in societal actors. The third section gained respondents\u2019 views on possible responses to these impacts at the levels of individual behaviour change and policy-making at multiple scales (further details of specific survey questions asked are given when presenting the results below in Section 4; a copy of the full questionnaire is available from the authors). The questionnaire was designed to include a mix of multiple choice questions, Likert scale responses, and free elicitations of word associations (e.g. as used by Lorenzoni et al., 2006). The latter were employed at the beginning of the survey to allow respondents to define relevant issues in their own terms and as they came to mind (immediacy and availability), with no ranking required. This method was designed to minimise framing effects by enabling personal, spontaneous and relatively unfiltered responses, providing access to subjective associations and meanings, thus offering some insight into how publics frame marine climate change issues in their own terms (this method has been used previously in some large scale studies, see Lorenzoni et al. 2006, Sherry-Brennan et al., 2010).  In this paper by framing we mean how the issue of climate change is defined, presented, and the meanings associated with it by any scientific, policy or social actor \u2013 although our specific focus here is on framings by publics. In regard to the concept of framing, we draw upon Nisbet\u2019s (2009) definition.  The UK survey formed part of a wider European survey on marine climate change impacts undertaken by the research team as part of an EU-funded project (CLAMER). TNS-BMRB, a large social research company with good UK and European-wide coverage and experience, was commissioned to conduct the survey in January 2011. The survey was administered online. Survey respondents were recruited from TNS-BMRB\u2019s UK online panel of 361,798 people, which is built to be representative of the national population (including in relation to categories of gender, age, region, education, and social grade) and is continuously updated. The UK internet penetration rate at the time of study was 82.5%. A proportion of the panel respondents (adults, 18 years and over) were invited to participate in the online survey via invitation emails. Invitations were repeated until hard quotas were met for age, [Pre-print - authors\u2019 accepted manuscript version.

The online methodology did not allow a definitive response rate to be calculated, partly because the system did not allow responses after quotas had been met and because a real time index of all e-mail addresses that make up the online panel was not available. The total UK response sample size was 1001 (850 drawn from the general population with a 151 oversample of adults living in coastal areas).  Of these 1001 respondents, small proportions indicated they lived in the East of England (N=78) and \u2018coastal areas of East [England]\u2019 (Eastern coast, N=43). The introductory letter sent to members of the online panel did not explicitly mention the survey topic to minimise prior framing effects, due to the importance of exploring open public framings at the beginning of the questionnaire. All respondents filled out the 20-minute questionnaire online via a dedicated URL link that they were permitted to access only once.    Table 1.

Available at: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2014.09.006]  \t\t 10 Survey data were subject to descriptive and inferential analysis undertaken by the research team, which also included extensive coding of open responses from the beginning of the questionnaire into key analytical categories drawn from the data itself rather than pre-defined themes. Coding of open elicitations followed a set coding protocol (where codes were formed for regular verbatim responses mentioned by over 3% of the sample), was conducted by one of the research team, and checked for accuracy and consistency by two other members of the team. The analysis presented in this article seeks to explore location in relation to individuals\u2019 framings, understandings and responses to marine climate change impacts. Survey responses are related to socio-demographic variations in other outputs by the authors.  3.2 In-depth qualitative research The in-depth qualitative part of the study brought together 20 members of the public with several climate change and marine environmental specialists in a day-long deliberative workshop held in West Runton situated on the North Norfolk coastline (in the county of Norfolk, within the Eastern region of the United Kingdom) on 25th June 2011. This in-depth approach served to complement, extend and further explain the survey findings. The rationale for this was twofold. First, the deliberative workshop provided opportunities for respondents to engage in a deeper, more interactive, and openly framed discussion which provided additional data on \u2018why\u2019 questions - for example in exploring the reasons underpinning forms of public understanding and response - thus aiding the interpretation of large-scale patterns and insights emerging from the more quantitative online survey (cf. Lorenzoni, 2006; Wolf and Moser, 2011). Second, the participatory nature of the workshop gave participants time and space to learn about and reflect on the issues in question in interaction with experts and fellow citizens (Webler et al., 1995; Chilvers, 2008), thus producing more informed and considered views on marine climate impacts than was afforded within the constraints of the large-scale online questionnaire.   Half of the workshop participants (N=10) were recruited from the North Norfolk coastal area and half (N=10) from Norwich (a city of c.140,100  inhabitants situated c.30 kilometres inland from the North Norfolk coast), selected to reflect key socio-demographic characteristics of both areas according to the most recent census records (see Table 2 for full details). Workshop participants were recruited through adverts in local communities and through completing a screening questionnaire; this enabled meeting sample quotas for socio-demographics of the two areas. Participants were invited to be involved in a discussion of environmental issues (not climate change per se) and received a small honorarium of \u00a350 in addition to travel costs for participating.

The workshop was structured into three main sessions and adopted a hybrid methodology drawing on different qualitative participatory methods in each. \u2022 The first session drew on focus group/in-depth group methods (Burgess et al., 1998) in allowing participants to openly explore framings of climate change and marine environments in their own terms. The interview protocol asked participants to discuss their understandings and engagement first with marine environments in general before moving on to more specific considerations of climate impacts. Here participants drew on their own experiences and relations to the topic prior to receiving any additional information.  \u2022 In the second session public participants engaged with information and expertise on marine climate impacts in a highly interactive process inspired by the Deliberative Mapping approach [Pre-print - authors\u2019 accepted manuscript version.

Participants interacted with expert and scientifically-defined perspectives on marine climate impacts \u2013 both through interacting with experts and through studying poster displays each of which provided information on: coastal flooding, extreme weather, coastal erosion, ocean acidification, sea level rise, changes in ocean currents, melting sea ice, rising sea temperatures, and changes in marine species distributions. As part of this session participants also took part in a beach walk led by the expert representatives, allowing direct connection with the issues involved in a way not usually afforded in deliberative processes that emphasise public talk (cf. Carolan, 2007). After considering relevant information and expertise participants reflected on this and expressed areas of concern in relation to different marine climate change impacts.  \u2022 A final session considered responses and policy priorities, drawing in part on participatory appraisal techniques (Chambers, 1994) to give participants an active role in making judgements on the priorities for action in responding to marine climate change issues, both in terms of their own individual actions and those of science and policy institutions.  All workshop discussions were audio recorded and fully transcribed. Transcripts were then subject to qualitative coding analysis according to established methodological protocols (Silverman, 1993) to develop key analytical themes from across the qualitative dataset and explore areas of consensus and difference between participant perspectives within these themes, as presented below. Codes were developed from prior sensitising concepts identified in the literature review and from close reading of the data itself, around the top level themes of: the meanings of marine climate change issues as matters of public concern, public knowledge and understanding, and public responses and responsibilities.    4. Public engagement with marine climate change issues In this section the large-scale survey and in-depth qualitative data are analysed in conjunction and directly compared in relation to three key themes each of which are presented in turn, namely: (i) the framing of marine climate change issues by study participants in their own terms; (ii) the nature of public knowledge and understanding of marine climate impacts; and (iii) public views on the responses of various actors (including themselves) to the threats posed. For each of these three themes, analysis of the survey data is presented first followed by qualitative findings. Where appropriate we show survey results for the whole of the UK (N=1001) alongside subsamples for the East of England and the Eastern coast to aid direct comparisons between the wider UK dataset and the region and locality where the citizens\u2019 panel took place.

Available at: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2014.09.006]  \t\t 13  4.1 Public framings  This section explores how study participants framed marine climate change issues based on the open elicitation survey responses about marine environments more generally and by drawing on the discussions, as well as the way in which participants responded to scientific definitions of the issue, in workshop deliberations. Following some socio-demographic questions, and one about the severity of issues globally, survey respondents were asked: \u201cWhen you think about the coastline or the sea, what are the three most important environmental matters that come to mind?\u201d, and were allowed three entries of maximum four words each. Most respondents provided three associations (although, for each elicitation, 1.3%, 3% and 6.1% respectively did not). Associations were expressed as either single word responses (e.g. \u2018refuse\u2019) or short phrases (e.g. \u2018rubbish on beaches and in sea\u2019). Among the first responses, 41 distinct associations were identified (the codebook is available from the authors). As shown in Figure 1, \u2018coastal erosion\u2019 was the most frequently mentioned association (27.5% of responses), closely followed by \u2018pollution\u2019 (20.8%), denoted as such by respondents. These two categories constitute nearly half of all first responses. Other associations related to contamination included \u2018oil pollution\u2019 (5.7%), \u2018water pollution\u2019 (4.7%), \u2018rubbish\u2019 (4%), \u2018sewage\u2019 (2.7%), and litter (1.4%). Juxtaposing references were made to \u2018water cleanliness\u2019 (3.1%), \u2018beach cleanliness\u2019 (2.4%) and \u2018cleanliness\u2019 (1.9%). The clear finding is that, in relation to marine environments, climate change explicitly, on this occasion, was not the most salient issue for most people. Only 3.6% of respondents mentioned \u2018climate change\u2019 directly (exact phrasing or similar wording); small proportions referred to other impacts possibly related to climate change such as sea level rise (5.4%) and flooding (2.1%). Fishing (fish stocks, 1.2%; overfishing, 2.2%) and wildlife (2.3%) were also mentioned; other associations were referred to by less than 1.4% of respondents.   Second and third responses largely reflect the associations provided in the first elicitation (see Figure 1). Not surprisingly, more categories emerged as respondents provided their second and third choice responses and some of the associations mentioned in the first instance become less prevalent.

N = 1001 (UK).     [Pre-print - authors\u2019 accepted manuscript version. Please cite as the published version: Chilvers, J., Lorenzoni, I., Terry, G., Buckley, P., Pinnegar, J.K. & Gelcich, S.

Among the East of England respondents, the most common word association (as expressed in the first elicitation occasion) continues to be \u2018coastal erosion\u2019 (40.2%), followed by \u2018pollution\u2019 (15.1%).  Second elicitations to this question reveal a similar pattern (19% of respondents to this question mentioning \u2018coastal erosion\u2019, 14.6% \u2018pollution\u2019).  Responses to the third elicitation occasion to this question start revealing other matters which are salient but not predominant: in addition to the ubiquitous \u2018pollution\u2019 (13.8%), frequent responses also feature \u2018overfishing\u2019 (13.3%) and \u2018wildlife\u2019 (13.5%).  For the small sample of respondents living on the eastern coast, \u2018coastal erosion\u2019 (51.4% of responses in the first elicitation occasion, 14.1% in the second) was paramount. This was followed by \u2018sea level rise\u2019 (mentioned by 9.5% of respondents in the first elicitation, 7.4% in the second); \u2018flooding\u2019, \u2018pollution\u2019 and \u2018water pollution\u2019 (17.5%, 16%, 14.9% in the second elicitation), \u2018overfishing\u2019 and \u2018wildlife\u2019 (12.9% and 15.2% in the third elicitation).  These results were largely reflected in the qualitative data from the deliberative workshop. At the beginning of the process when participants openly discussed marine environments, the most predominant environmental issues relating to the coastline and the sea were again pollution and erosion, with overfishing and effects on wildlife also evident. Previous studies have shown how UK publics often associate marine environments with pollution (Howard and Parsons, 2006; Mee et al, 2008), a connection that participants often made based on personal experience, as this quote illustrates:  \u201cI\u2019ve noticed that the beaches are dirtier, there\u2019s more stuff washing up that is clearly what people have put down toilets, that hasn\u2019t actually disintegrated.\u201d (Tanya, Norwich \u2013 Session 1)  Further insights into public framings are provided through the ways in which workshop participants responded to scientifically defined information and definitions of the issues in question. Information presented in the participatory workshop - in presentations by scientists and in posters - defined marine climate change impacts in terms of scientifically derived categories such as sea temperature changes, sea level rise and ocean acidification, which were informed by a scientific review of marine climate change impacts in Europe (see Heip et al. 2011). While participants were very able to engage with these impact categories (as illustrated in section 4.2 below), some openly reflected upon and at times challenged these compartmentalised issue definitions. This was expressed, for example, through [Pre-print - authors\u2019 accepted manuscript version. Please cite as the published version: Chilvers, J., Lorenzoni, I., Terry, G., Buckley, P., Pinnegar, J.K. & Gelcich, S. (2014) \u2018Public engagement with marine climate change issues: (Re)framings, understandings and responses\u2019, Global Environmental Change 29: 165-179. Available at: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2014.09.006]  \t\t 16 several workshop participants emphasising that all of the impacts under discussion and underlying (social and physical) processes, were deeply interconnected: \u201cIt\u2019s all linked, isn\u2019t it?\u201d (Barbara, North Norfolk coast \u2013 Session 2)  \u201cEverything that we\u2019ve talked about today and everything I feel I know on the subject would suggest that all those [processes] are interrelated.\u201d (Donald, Norwich \u2013 Session 2)  Some participants went further in expressing climate change, as well as marine climate change impacts in particular, as part of a wider problem: that of human beings\u2019 relationship with their environments. For example, one participant explicitly rejected the dominant framing of climate change as a stand-alone issue in the following way:  \u201cHumans, as a rule, we should just live by the fact that you don\u2019t mess up your own backyard, so let\u2019s go \u2026 with the actual stuff that people can focus on. If you clean up the pollution, generally you\u2019ll go back through the chain of all the other things that pollute, possibly pump out the carbon dioxide etcetera, which would then hopefully reduce these issues, if they exist, that we\u2019re actually going through. So I personally think the whole concept and term [climate change] is wrong and we need to go back to basics in terms of what the environment is and what we need to do with it.\u201d (Joseph, Norwich \u2013 Session 1)  The findings presented in this section from both the wider public survey and in-depth group discussions support each other in revealing that although climate change impacts play some part, they are not necessarily foremost in the way that the research participants framed marine and coastal environment-related issues. Furthermore most participants did not tend to compartmentalise the issues involved or view them in technically-defined terms. Rather most respondents viewed climate change impacts in a more situated, joined up and relational way, in the context of other more immediate concerns in their daily lives and issues affecting marine environments more widely.   4.2 Public understandings  This section brings together findings on public knowledge and understandings of marine climate impacts and the salience of these issues to the public. We draw on data where public views on marine climate impacts in particular were directly elicited in the survey and qualitative research. In many [Pre-print - authors\u2019 accepted manuscript version. Please cite as the published version: Chilvers, J., Lorenzoni, I., Terry, G., Buckley, P., Pinnegar, J.K. & Gelcich, S. (2014) \u2018Public engagement with marine climate change issues: (Re)framings, understandings and responses\u2019, Global Environmental Change 29: 165-179. Available at: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2014.09.006]  \t\t 17 respects this confirms the findings about public framings given above while providing more detailed insights into the degree of public salience and concern of different impacts.  After a question on the causes of climate change, survey respondents were asked about affective associations (see Szalay and Deese, 1978; Peters and Slovic, 1996): \u201cWhich three things, if any, come to mind when you think about the impacts of climate change on the coastline or the sea?\u201d and to rate each self-reported association as \u2018a good thing\u2019, \u2018neither a good nor a bad thing\u2019, and \u2018a bad thing\u2019.  The word associations overall reveal particularly salient references (see Figure 2): most notably those to \u2018sea level rise\u2019 and \u2018coastal erosion\u2019, followed by \u2018flooding\u2019 (respectively 32.1%, 27.4% and 8.1% of responses in the first elicitation). The difference with the previous question where references to climate change in relation to the marine environment were unsolicited is evident: the threat of sea level rise is more to the forefront of respondents\u2019 thoughts in regards to the sea. The responses to this question are revealing in other ways: second and third responses suggest individuals also relate impacts of climate change with contamination (\u2018pollution\u2019), impacts on the natural (\u2018weather\u2019, \u2018temperature rise\u2019, \u2018melting icecaps\u2019, \u2018wildlife\u2019, \u2018marine species\u2019) as well as human (\u2018coastal communities\u2019) environments. The average affect assigned to the most common first associations is consistently negative (ranging from -0.57 to the absolute -1 attributed to pollution). This indicates that respondents associate negative connotations and feelings to the impacts they most frequently mentioned in relation to impacts of climate change on the coastline / sea; to one all respondents attributed negative associations (e.g. \u2018pollution\u2019), to others respondents were either negative or neutral (indicated by a lower mean and higher standard deviation, see Figure 2).   For respondents living in the East of England (those who indicated that they lived in the East of England), most paramount associations were \u2018sea level rise\u2019 (37.5% at first elicitation, 15.8% at second), \u2018coastal erosion\u2019 (35.4% at first elicitation, 17.2% at second), \u2018flooding\u2019 (13.6% at second elicitation), \u2018wildlife\u2019, \u2018pollution\u2019 and \u2018nothing\u2019 (respectively 12.3%, 12.4% and 10.3% at the third elicitation).  These mirrored the associations offered by respondents living on the eastern coast, which in fact appear even more accentuated: \u2018sea level rise\u2019 and \u2018coastal erosion\u2019 were mentioned by 48.3% and 27.3% of respondents in the first opportunity for association in this question. \u2018Coastal erosion\u2019 again was mentioned frequently in the second association (31.3%) as well as \u2018wildlife\u2019 (10.7%). Third associations provided more varied responses: \u2018wildlife\u2019 (13.4%), \u2018pollution\u2019 (13.9%) and \u2018flooding\u2019 (12.4%).

Responses to these open elicitations indicate that individuals are to some extent already relating to marine environmental issues, with and without consideration of climate change, and in their own terms raise a diverse and relevant range of issues. It is interesting that one of the most dominant associations is \u2018coastal erosion\u2019, preceded by \u2018pollution\u2019 in regards to general impacts on marine environments (Figure 1) and \u2018sea level rise\u2019 with regards to climate change impacts (Figure 2).

Further insights into the public salience of marine climate impacts were obtained by eliciting respondents\u2019 reported informedness and concern in relation to a set of pre-defined categories. These categories where informed by a science review of marine climate change impacts undertaken alongside the public survey (see Heip et al. 2011) to ensure good coverage of relevant impacts. The findings in Figures 3 and 4 support the above analysis of public framings: across the national UK sample, as well as in sub samples (East of England and the Eastern coast), respondents\u2019 prevalent concerns (70-80%) are about coastal erosion and coastal flooding (which most respondents professed to be most informed about), closely followed by sea level rise and destruction of habitats.  Concern about coastal erosion reflects a recent Ipsos-Mori (2013) survey of UK publics, indicating that for high proportions of respondents coastal erosion was a serious problem now and likely in the future.  Relatively lower levels of concern were manifested by respondents regarding less localised impacts (e.g. melting ice, changes in frequency of extreme events, 64-65%), possibly indicating they are perceived to be less salient and tangible; however, respondents in the East of England and on the eastern coast of the country expressed concern about these.  This seems to suggest some geographical variability in salience, although we are cautious in our interpretation as respondent numbers in these areas (East of England, and eastern coast) in our samples are low.   As Figures 3 and 4 illustrate, there is some correspondence and relatively consistent ranking of impacts between levels of informedness and concern. Indeed, Spearman rank-order correlations among all the concern and informedness items are positive, low (\u03c1\u2264.424) and significant, indicating there are direct associations between them. Impacts with high expressed levels of informedness are also of high concern (e.g. coastal erosion, \u03c1=.333, p<.01; coastal flooding, \u03c1=.307, p<.01). The five impacts of lowest informedness (i.e. between 5-20%: ocean acidification, jellyfish blooms/swarms, effects of marine invasive species, changes in distribution of wildlife, and ocean current changes) are also the five lowest in terms of concern (ranging between 40-54%). There are some inconsistencies in this overall pattern, however: for instance, low informedness about destruction of habitats (27-30% across all geographic scales) vs. high concern (65-72%).

Available at: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2014.09.006]  \t\t 21 Overall these data indicate that marine climate change impacts that are more immediate, visible, tangible and \u2018available\u2019 (in that they form part of common discourses around marine environments and climate change) tend to be more salient (i.e. show higher expressed levels of informedness and concern) for publics in the UK, which supports the findings of existing studies noted in Section 2 (e.g. O\u2019Neill and Hulme, 2009).   This inference was widely confirmed by a number of participants in workshop deliberations. For example, some participants attributed the visibility of coastal erosion to the physical proximity of a vulnerable coastline and consequent local media coverage (in contrast to ocean acidification):   \u201cBecause of where we are near the coast and we are in relatively low lying lands... it\u2019s something that is higher up in our consciousness than the acidity of the sea, we don\u2019t really hear that on the news in the evening... It\u2019s local and immediacy that make you more concerned about something.\u201d (Carrie, Norwich \u2013 Session 2)  Underlying explanations for expressed salience and concern are clearly complex and demand deeper insights into the nature of public understandings, knowledge and beliefs in relation to marine climate change impacts. In this regard the survey provided evidence that UK publics have a good sense of the scientific estimates and information on the issue. For instance, in response to a question on future projected sea level rise survey respondents accorded well with scientific opinion, given the range of uncertainty that exists: 35.9% of respondents thought that waters would rise by 10cm to 1m by end of the century, with a further 24.7% saying the figure would be between 1 and 5m (of the remainder, 21.2% indicated the rise would be less than 10cm; 10.2% maintained the rise would be 5m to just under 10m, 4% stated that the rise would be 10m or more; and 4% indicated there would be no rise in sea level over the century). The IPCC (2013) projects a 26-82cm rise in sea level over the same period. These findings are in contrast with other studies (e.g. Poortinga & Pidgeon, 2003; Reynolds et al., 2010), which emphasise low levels of knowledge and understanding about climate change and its impacts amongst publics.   Public understandings of marine climate impacts are about much more than acquiring scientific knowledge, however. In-depth qualitative data further reveal the nature of these understandings and help explain survey findings about framings and concerns presented above. A significant analytical code derived from workshop deliberations was the critical role ascribed to experiential and local knowledge in shaping public understandings of marine environmental change such as marine climate [Pre-print - authors\u2019 accepted manuscript version.

Several participants gave examples of how their own personal experiences had shaped their understandings of marine environmental change, in the same way that sociologists and other social scientists have repeatedly shown how personal experience, whether direct or vicarious, is a key aspect of lay knowledge on environmental issues (cf. Wynne, 1991; Irwin, 1995; Myatt-Bell et al., 2002). For instance a seaman described how he had noticed an increase in maximum wave heights over the years, while another participant talked about changes in fish species distribution due to rising sea temperatures thus illustrating the importance of vicarious experiences and personal interactions in shaping knowledge, in this case through a fisherman she knew:  \u201cEvery year it seems to be increasing, the amount of wave action on our coast.\u201d (Ralph, North Norfolk coast \u2013 Session 1)   \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of change in the fish economy. I\u2019m quite good friends with [a fisherman] who says people don\u2019t want to buy species of fish they are not familiar with. He says he is running out of money because he is catching things that people don't want to eat.\u201d (Zahra, North Norfolk coast \u2013 Session 1).  In-depth group discussions also revealed how participants\u2019 perceptions of marine climate change impacts were also closely tied to their sense of personal risk. Within this code, some workshop participants clearly stated that threats perceived as spatially and temporally remote received lower recognition, for instance:   \u201cIf it\u2019s miles away, I\u2019m not that bothered, as I say the closer to home it is, the more it hurts.\u201d (Michael, Norwich \u2013 Session 2)  Other participants acknowledged that although some risks may be directly borne disproportionately by certain groups within society, the overall risk becomes distributed among many thus being incurred indirectly. This closely relates to an important code on moral and equity considerations regarding other people and species. Here some participants expressed an affective connection with distant places and peoples affected by climate change, and the moral need to take responsibility for such impacts, as reflected by this quote for example:  \u201cMost of us are in a privileged position, whereas 75 to 200 million people by 2020 will be experiencing shortages of fresh water. That\u2019s a real impact, they\u2019d be worried. We\u2019ve got blue [Pre-print - authors\u2019 accepted manuscript version.

The clear finding from both survey and qualitative data is that when it comes to responding to climate change impacts, publics emphasised climate change mitigation actions over adaptation. As shown in Figure 5, in considering the \u2018most effective actions individuals should take to reduce and cope with the impacts of climate change\u2019, most respondents highlighted behavioural changes relating to mitigation, with the two most frequently mentioned being reducing energy use at home and using energy from sustainable sources (66% and 56% of responses respectively at UK level). This contrasts quite markedly with the behavioural responses that might be taken at an individual or household-level to adapt to the impacts of marine climate change: far fewer UK respondents identified preparing homes against flooding (16%), moving to a less flood prone area (13%) or purchasing flood insurance (5%).

Actions others should take on mitigation and adaptation, expressed as percentage of responses to the question \u2018From the list below, please select the three most effective actions you feel individuals should take to reduce and cope with the impacts of climate change\u2019 at UK (N=1001), East of England (N=78) and Eastern coast (N=43) levels.

Available at: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2014.09.006]  \t\t 24 The survey also indicates discrepancies between what people claim are the most effective ways of addressing climate change and its impacts, and the actions they reportedly take in their personal lives (see Figure 6). One explanation for these discrepancies, for example in the case of using energy from sustainable sources, is prevailing barriers and infrastructural constraints to action, which workshop discussions highlighted as including: financial constraints, reduced sense of personal agency, and limited service provision (cf. Shove, 1998; Lorenzoni et al., 2007). It is important to note, however, that notwithstanding limits to the reliability of self-reported pro-environmental actions, the data provide strong evidence that citizens are responding to the challenge of living more sustainably. This is reflected in large proportions of individuals at national level reportedly reducing home water use (76%), buying environmentally friendly products (72%) and locally sourced food (69%), and even taking more local holidays (48%). The two subsamples (individuals in the East of England and those living on the eastern coast) exhibit very similar responses to those at the national level (see Figures 5 and 6).    Figure 6. Mitigation and adaptation actions individuals had taken, expressed as a percentage of \u2018yes\u2019 responses to the question \u2018Please indicate whether you have taken any of the following actions to reduce and cope with the impacts of climate change\u2019, at UK (N=1001), East of England (N=78) and Eastern coast (N=43) levels.   These actions reiterate respondents\u2019 more holistic and integrated views of environmental problems. Further analyses however suggest that respondents related differently to the items in this question which focused on reducing and coping with the impacts of climate change, namely on mitigation, adaptation and sustainability more generally. The low Cronbach \u03b1 values (<0.8) may indicate [Pre-print - authors\u2019 accepted manuscript version.

Additional Spearman rank-order correlations show a discrepancy between actions respondents have taken themselves and those they feel others should take to reduce and cope with the impacts of climate change: the same type of adaptation action at the general individual level (purchasing flood insurance, preparing homes against flooding, moving home) is negatively and weakly correlated with the same action taken by individual respondents (\u03c1 \u2264 -.119, p<.01).    The tendency for survey respondents to ascribe lower priority to adaptation responses was also confirmed in the in-depth group deliberations despite some participants living in locations at high risk to marine climate change impacts. This is broadly consistent with the findings of other studies in high risk communities, such as those vulnerable to coastal flooding (e.g. Harvatt et al., 2011; Zsamboky et al., 2011), which also found that individuals did not regard flood risk as important or urgent. The in-depth qualitative data provides deeper insights into the underlying reasons for this. These include the argument put forward by some participants that adaptation is a defeatist approach and the \u2018easy\u2019 option in comparison to various possible mitigation actions (an argument that has long permeated international negotiations on climate change; Pielke et al., 2007), as the following participant noted:   \u201cIt\u2019s interesting to even think of these as being in any way mutually exclusive, because you could certainly do either, and then because of the way things are going, you\u2019ll probably be required to do the adaption bit anyway. It\u2019s just worrying to think that you might go to adaption as a way of not doing anything else.\u201d (Donald, Norwich \u2013 Session 3)  This was intertwined with feelings of complacency, a disregard of immediate threats, and a sense of limited personal agency to respond to marine climate impacts such as sea level rise and coastal flooding:   \u201cI\u2019m conscious about some of the issues, but I can\u2019t see how I can actually do something to affect them personally, like I can\u2019t change coastal erosion; I can\u2019t change the water levels.\u201d (Michael, Norwich \u2013 Session 3)  Mitigation actions were at the forefront of participants\u2019 discussions about tackling climate change, which may reflect it being a dominant discourse in climate change communications in recent years, thus crowding out adaptation concerns. One further explanation evident in workshop deliberations [Pre-print - authors\u2019 accepted manuscript version.

This also contrasts with the dominant, policy-relevant discourses focussed on technical adaptation (e.g. Yohe and Tol, 2002). In group discussions adaptation was seen as a feature of everyday live and routine decisions made by members of the public, for example in relation to where one lives and consuming fish:  \u201cI would assume that everybody here knows about the areas on the Norfolk coast which are in most danger of erosion and therefore would not probably look at buying a property there, so that\u2019s adapting because you\u2019re not thinking I\u2019m going to live here ... I suppose we\u2019re all doing that, we\u2019re all making choices every day about what we do so we are adapting.\u201d (Tanya, Norwich \u2013 Session 3)  \u201cSea bass are becoming more popular: where I live at Sea Palling, there\u2019s a lot more sea bass there. People do like sea bass\u201d. (Daniel, North Norfolk coast - Session 3)... \u201cIt\u2019s cheaper as well, it used to be a luxury and now you can afford to get it, and it\u2019s beautiful fish, as well.\u201d (Zahra, North Norfolk coast \u2013 Session 3)   5. Discussion and conclusions  In response to a relative paucity of literature on how publics relate to marine climate change issues, this paper reports on the first large-scale survey on the subject, linked with in-depth qualitative research. In the following discussion and concluding statements we draw together the key findings from across the above analysis. In doing this we further interpret these findings in relation the existing literature and reflect on the significance and limits of the mixed-method approach used in the study. We focus on three aspects in particular. First, we review our findings on how public participants frame and understand marine climate change issues, considering underlying explanations for the patterns observed. Second, we reflect on the seemingly counterintuitive finding that, even in high-risk areas, public participants in our study prioritised mitigation over adaptation responses. Third, we consider the implications of our findings for future research and practice of public engagement with marine climate change impacts.   An important component of our survey approach was the initial open elicitation questions which sought to more openly enable publics to provide their own framings of marine climate change issues. [Pre-print - authors\u2019 accepted manuscript version. Please cite as the published version: Chilvers, J., Lorenzoni, I., Terry, G., Buckley, P., Pinnegar, J.K. & Gelcich, S. (2014) \u2018Public engagement with marine climate change issues: (Re)framings, understandings and responses\u2019, Global Environmental Change 29: 165-179. Available at: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2014.09.006]  \t\t 27 To our knowledge this is the first time such a technique has been used to explore extensive public views on this topic. It shows that when it comes to marine environmental issues more generally, climate change in particular is not the most important matter of concern for most survey respondents, with pollution and costal erosion being more significant in all geographical regions analysed (Section 4.1). This is not to say that climate change impacts were not mentioned - coastal erosion can be interpreted as a climate change-related impact - but it suggests they were viewed in context of other marine environmental issues. Some care is needed in interpreting this finding, not least because survey data do not reveal how respondents related to the term \u2018marine environments\u2019, and whether this term encompassed climate change or vice versa. This is where results from the in-depth qualitative research, albeit drawn from one region of the UK, provide valuable additional insights into this dynamic. Openly framed discussions about marine environments in the first session of the deliberative workshop saw most participants initially identifying a range of issues including pollution, degradation of the natural environments, and coastal erosion. Climate change was not the most immediate issue for participants in these discussions. Responses to information and expertise on specific climate change impact categories in Session 2 adds weight to the evidence that most participants viewed climate change impacts as specific and specialist issues compared to their own situated experiences. Furthermore, some participants emphasised the interconnected nature of marine climate change issues as part of wider concerns about environment and humanity. Taken together, this evidence from across the mixed methods leads us to conclude that public participants involved in this research predominantly approached marine climate change impacts \u2018in context\u2019, in a situated and relational way, making connections between them and in relation to other matters of concern in their everyday lives. This conclusion echoes work in social studies of science and society that shows publics to be simultaneously entangled in and associated with multiple networks and \u2018matters of concern\u2019 in situ and in multivalent ways (Wynne, 1993; Latour, 2004). It also concurs with recent studies that emphasise the importance of context in public perceptions of climate change more generally (e.g. Capstick and Pidgeon, 2014) and emerging work on marine climate impacts more specifically (e.g. Gee, 2010; Combest-Friedman et al., 2012; Moser, 2014).  Related to these points on framing, the above analysis has also furthered insights into public knowledge and understanding of marine climate change issues. At a time when international attention is increasingly focussing on the sustainability of marine environments (e.g. IPCC 2014; the recently instituted Global Ocean Commission), received wisdom is often that publics lack understanding and connection with marine issues which are in some respects distant and remote (e.g. Heip et al 2011). Through encompassing both coastal and sea environments in the scope of our study (as elicited in the [Pre-print - authors\u2019 accepted manuscript version. Please cite as the published version: Chilvers, J., Lorenzoni, I., Terry, G., Buckley, P., Pinnegar, J.K. & Gelcich, S. (2014) \u2018Public engagement with marine climate change issues: (Re)framings, understandings and responses\u2019, Global Environmental Change 29: 165-179. Available at: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2014.09.006]  \t\t 28 survey) we offer important insights into the patterning of public understanding. The first observation in this regard is that the level of knowledge and engagement with marine environmental issues was perhaps higher than expected: open elicitation survey responses and initial in-depth group discussions showed respondents raising diverse marine environmental issues without receiving prior information (Section 4.1); and survey responses showed moderate levels of public awareness across most climate impact categories in addition to some level of engagement with scientific information on these topics (Section 4.2). Emerging strongly in relation to this, from analysis of both survey and in-depth group discussions, is that public understandings of marine climate impacts were mainly shaped by personal experience, the visibility and proximity of impacts and perceived risk, and sense of morality regarding other people and species. Awareness and concern was highest for impacts that are more visible, tangible and \u2018available\u2019 (in that they form part of common discourses around marine environments and climate change) - for example sea-level rise and coastal erosion were the more prominent perceived threats compared to impacts like ocean acidification, sea temperature change and effects of marine invasive species. Qualitative data added further insight as illustrated through representative testimonies from workshop participants\u2019 talk (in Sections 4.1 and 4.2). While not exclusively so, there is a clear spatial dimension to this study\u2019s findings of public engagement, with impacts \u2018close to the coast\u2019 being more immediately apparent to participants than those \u2018out to sea\u2019. This resonates with recent studies emphasising the importance of experience and place attachment in public perceptions of climate change risks (e.g. Harvatt et al. 2011; Quinn and Adger, 2011; Carlton and Jacobson, 2013; Devine-Wright, 2013).  A particularly striking finding from our analysis is the expressed low importance of adaptation relative to mitigation responses. Even respondents most at risk, such as communities living in areas vulnerable to coastal erosion or flooding (as discussed in Section 4.3), considered adaptation to be secondary in importance to mitigation, for a variety of reasons. This finding is supported by both survey responses, which show higher action and priorities attached to mitigation over adaptation, and expressions in workshop deliberations (Section 4.3). Whilst seemingly counter-intuitive, this finding is confirmed in other recent studies into public responses to marine climate impacts in the UK (e.g. Harvatt et al 2011, Zsamboky et al 2011) and in other countries (e.g. Moser, 2013). A reluctance to consider adaptation actions as equally important to mitigation actions at an individual level could indicate low perceived \u2018self-efficacy\u2019 and perceived \u2018adaptation efficacy\u2019 (see Grothmann and Patt, 2005), as well as highlighting the importance of place attachment, emotional connection, lack of personal efficacy and trust in institutions in mediating these responses (see Gee, 2010; Devine-Wright and Howes, 2010; Harvatt et al 2011;). However, in keeping with the above discussion of public [Pre-print - authors\u2019 accepted manuscript version.

Available at: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2014.09.006]  \t\t 29 framings, supporting evidence from workshop deliberations suggests that individuals are indeed adaptable and already adapting in diverse ways but do not openly associate their actions with formal or institutional definitions of adaptation and resilience building (for example: HM Government, 2013; IPCC 2014). Furthermore, the predominant global climate change policy discourse, including media coverage, has tended to emphasise mitigation over adaptation (Boykoff & Roberts, 2007; Boykoff et al. 2013). Perhaps we are in fact witnessing an artificial separation created by our analytical lenses between adaptation and mitigation, whereas for publics these are meshed and closely related in daily practices and decision making at different levels. Moser (2013) has found a similar lack of public identification with formal institutional meanings of adaptation in the U.S. through in-depth focus group studies. In a recent review on the state of the art in communicating climate adaptation Moser (2014: 341) goes on to note the dearth of \u201csystematic studies of how \u2018adaptation\u2019 is framed, understood and whether it is a compelling term in other regions of the world\u201d, which points to the importance of the UK results we have presented in this paper.  Finally, we consider the implications of our findings for research and practices of public engagement relating to marine climate impacts specifically, and climate change more generally. The first point to note is that our findings suggest that attempts at communication and engagement on marine climate change issues should be sensitive to people\u2019s own local circumstances and how they approach these issues in their own terms (cf. Carlton & Jacobson, 2013). While similar recommendations have been made for climate change more generally (e.g. Lorenzoni et al., 2007; O\u2019Neill and Nicholson-Cole, 2009), in this particular context our findings suggest the need to connect to other marine environmental issues and socio-cultural dimensions; communications narrowly framed in terms of technically or institutionally-defined marine climate impact categories are unlikely to connect as effectively with diverse publics. Following on from this, our second recommendation centres on the need to create spaces of \u2018collective experimentation\u2019 (Felt and Wynne, 2007; Callon et al., 2009) that builds on existing work in developing participatory arrangements for addressing coastal and marine climate change issues (see for example, Tompkins et al., 2008). Such spaces, through bringing decision-makers, scientists, and publics together on a more open and equal footing, can attempt to bridge disconnects and build reflexivity, such as over meanings of adaptation observed in our analysis where formal institutional framings contrast with more situated and vernacular public meanings.   In many respects the interactive deliberative process in our study represents such a space of co-production in itself, which speaks to the wider public survey. While its primary purpose was to explore in much more depth what underpins and explains public responses to marine climate change [Pre-print - authors\u2019 accepted manuscript version.

Extending the in-depth component of this research to other geographic areas, whether that be in other regions of the UK (employing multi-site deliberative research approaches, such as those used by Corner et al. 2013 for example), or cross-cultural comparisons between countries, is thus a key area for further research. Having said this, it is important to maintain reflexive awareness of the constructed nature and partiality of all forms of participation and public representation (Marres, 2007; Brown, 2009; Chilvers, 2013), not only with respect to invited processes such as surveys and deliberative fora but in terms of all the diverse forms of public involvement that make up public issues relating to climate change. So our final point is to stress the importance of opening up to, acknowledging, and better accounting for the diverse ways in which publics are already engaging with and mobilising around such issues in \u2018uninvited\u2019 and multiple ways (cf. Wynne, 2007) - ranging from activism and public campaigns (e.g. Fish Fight), community flood groups, community beach surveying and co-management (e.g. the Marine Conservation Society), through to diverse responses and distributed innovations occurring at the household level and in wider society. The real challenge for science and policy institutions in the climate change domain is to understand, learn from and respond to these diverse public engagements, rather than seeing them as a problem, threat or something to be controlled. It is in these more humble terms that science and policy institutions have a better chance of mobilising change to address significant environmental problems, even on some of the more complex and distant marine climate change impacts dealt with in this paper.

    "abstract": "Climate change is believed to represent a serious challenge to poverty reduction efforts around the globe. This paper conducts an up-to-date review of three main strands of the literature analyzing the poverty impacts of climate change : (i) economy-wide growth models incorporating climate change impacts to work out consistent scenarios for how climate change might affect the path of poverty over the next decades; (ii) studies focusing on the poverty impacts of climate change in the agricultural sector; and (iii) studies exploring how past climate variability impacts poverty. The analysis finds that the majority of the estimates of the poverty impacts tend to ignore the effect of aggregate economic growth on poverty and household welfare. The empirical evidence available to date suggests that climate change will slow the pace of global poverty reduction, but the expected poverty impact will be relatively modest and far from reversing the major decline in poverty that is expected to occur over the next 40 years as a result of continued economic growth. The studies focusing on the sector-specific channels of impacts of climate change suggest that the estimated impacts of climate change on agricultural yields are generally a poor predictor of the poverty impacts of climate change at the national level due to heterogeneity in the ability of households to adapt. It also appears that the impacts of climate change are generally regressive, that is, they fall more heavily on the poor than the rich.Rural Poverty Reduction,Climate Change Economics,Science of Climate Change,Climate Change Mitigation and Green House Gases,Regional Economic Development",

INTRODUCTION \nThe continued decline in global poverty during the last 100 years is a remarkable \nachievement, a decline that has been even more significant in the last three decades. In 1981, the \npercentage of the world population living below $1.25 a day was 52 percent. By 2005, that rate \nhad more than halved to 25 percent (Chen and Ravallion, 2010). This trend is expected to \ncontinue especially if developing countries manage to sustain the rapid per capita income \ngrowth rates they achieved over the last decade. If developing countries do maintain their \nincome growth rates, poverty headcounts at the $1 or $2 per day could turn out to be almost \nobsolete as measures of well-being over the next 50 to 100 years.  \nAt the same time another process has been unfolding over the last century. Scientific \nevidence shows that the global mean surface temperature of the earth has been rapidly rising \ndue to increased emission of green house gases (IPCC 2007a). The resulting climate change2 is \nlikely to have a negative effect on agricultural productivity, particularly in the tropical regions, \nand to directly impact on poor people\u2019s livelihood assets -including their health, access to water \nand natural resources, homes and infrastructure (World Bank 2010a). There are increasing \nconcerns that the change in the patterns of climatic variability is also likely to add to the already \nhigh vulnerability of poor households, which would exacerbate the incidence, severity and \npersistence of poverty in developing countries. These concerns are rooted in the fact that most \ndeveloping countries are more dependent on agriculture and other climate-sensitive natural \nresources for income and well-being, and that they also lack sufficient financial and technical \ncapacities to manage increasing climate risk. In this context, climate change is believed to \nrepresent a serious challenge to poverty reduction efforts around the globe.  \nGiven the complexities involved in an analysis of the poverty impacts of climate change, \ndifferent approaches may be helpful in considering these impacts. One way is to use economy-\nwide growth models incorporating climate change impacts to work out consistent scenarios for \nhow climate change might affect the path of poverty over the next decades. Another approach is \nto learn about sector-specific channels through which longer-term climate change affects \n                                                       \n2 According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) climate refers to the statistical description in \nterms of the mean and variability of quantities such as temperature and precipitation over a period of time ranging \nfrom months to thousands of years.  The norm is 30 years as defined by the World Meteorological Organization \n(WMO). Climate is different from weather which refers to atmospheric conditions in a given place at a specific time. \nIn general, the studies described in this paper deal with the two different components of climate change. 3 \n \npoverty, the size of such impacts, the potential heterogeneity of impacts, and the types of \npolicies that may alleviate the adverse impacts. The information generated by this approach is \nuseful in tackling poverty today, as well as in preparing for how to adapt to climate change in \nthe future. Yet another approach is to explore how current climate variability affects poverty, \nand then examine the impacts of increased variability on future poverty.  \nIn this paper we review the various studies that have appeared recently with estimates \nof the poverty and distributional impacts of climate change in these complementary directions. \nGiven the multidimensional nature of welfare and the myriad of ways in which climate change \ncan impact on the different dimensions of household well-being, we limit our discussion to \nmonetary measures (i.e. consumption and/or income per capita) especially since these are used \nto calculate poverty rates.  However, it is important to bear in mind, that climate change may \nalso have serious effects on health which is also an important dimension of welfare, as well as \non ecosystem services (apart from agriculture) which are difficult to assign a monetary value. In \nSection 2 we analyze the potential effects of climate change on poverty from an aggregate \nperspective without considering any potential heterogeneity of impacts across the population.  \n(The Appendix in the end of the paper contains a detailed description of the methodology and \nthe data used to project the impacts of climate change on poverty using the RICE model \ndeveloped by Nordhaus (2010)). In Section 3 we describe papers that analyze the channels \nthrough which climate change will affect specific sectors of the population based on household \nlevel data. Finally, key messages from this emerging literature and policy recommendations are \nlaid out in Section 4.  \n \n2.  CLIMATE CHANGE AND GLOBAL POVERTY FROM AN AGGREGATE PERSPECTIVE \nBefore reviewing the empirical literature it is worth asking what is involved in making \npredictions about the poverty impacts of climate change using aggregate data. In general, such \npredictions  require  five  pieces  of  information.  To  begin  with,  one  needs  estimates  of  two \nelasticities: (i) the output-climate elasticity; and (ii) the poverty-output elasticity. The output-climate \nelasticity provides an estimate of the percentage change in output due a change in climate based \non historical data and it is useful for predicting the effect of future climate change on economic \nactivity.  The  poverty-output  (or  poverty-growth  elasticity),  also  based  on  historical  data, \ntranslates percentage changes in output per capita into changes in the poverty rate. In addition 4 \n \nto these elasticities, one need to know how climate will change in the future, what the GPD per \ncapita (or income) trajectory would be in the absence of climate change, and how population \nwill  grow.  In  general,  papers  in  this  section  differ  with  respect  to  how  they estimate  these \nelasticities and the type of information they use about future projections. \n \n2.1 Backward looking approach \nA number of recent studies have opted for a \u2015backward looking\u2016 approach to analyze \nthe effects of climate change on economic activity, and ultimately on poverty. These studies, \nmimicking the approach emphasized in the growth and development literatures, examine the \nrelationship between climate and aggregate economic variables in cross-sections of countries or \nregions. One advantage offered by this approach is that by examining aggregate outcomes \ndirectly, it is possible to avoid relying on a priori assumptions about which mechanisms to \ninclude in the climate-economy interactions and how these mechanisms might interact, and \nultimately influence macroeconomic outcomes. Another advantage derived by the use of \ncross-sectional data is that they yield estimates of the long-relationship between climate and \naggregate output taking into account historical adaptation.  \nOne such study is by Dell et al. (2009) who use cross-sectional data from 134 countries to \nexamine the effects of temperature on the level of GDP. Their output-climate elasticity estimate, \nbased  on  historical  data,  reveals  that  each  additional  degree  Celsius  is  associated  with  a \nstatistically significant reduction of 8.9 percentage points of per capita GDP. The authors also \nprovide evidence of this elasticity at the sub-national level by considering the temperature-\nincome relationship using data at the municipal level for twelve countries in the Latin America \nand  Caribbean  region.  Remarkably,  they  find  a  negative  relationship  between  income  and \ntemperature  when  looking  within  countries,  and  even  when  looking  within  states  within \ncountries.3  However, they make no attempt to either simulate the impacts of the predicted \ntemperature increase on income, or estimate its effect on poverty. \nIn  a  similar  vein,  Andersen  and  Verner   (2010)  examine  the  relationship  between \ntemperature and welfare at the municipality level within five countries in Latin America \n                                                       \n3 The within-country cross sectional relationship is substantially weaker than the cross-country correlation, but it \nremains  statistically  significant  and  of  an  economically  important  magnitude,  with  a  1  degree  Celsius  rise  in \ntemperature associated with a 1.2-1.9 percent decline in municipal per capita income (not GDP). 5 \n \n(Bolivia, Mexico, Brazil, Peru, and Chile).4 The coefficients of temperature (and temperature \nsquared) provide an estimate of the long-run relationship between temperature and welfare (i.e. \nthe output-climate elasticity) inclusive of adaptation.  The estimated relationships are then used \nto simulate the impact of the climate changes that the IPCC projects for the next 50 years. Their \npoverty analysis is, however, crude. The authors do not attempt to estimate the poverty-output \nelasticity; they simple assume that a negative relationship exists between per capita income and \npoverty. As previously explained,  income per capita and population growth  projections are \nneeded in order to be more precise about the number of poor people fifty years from now. \nBecause of this, the authors  are careful to warn  that their  simulation results should not be \ninterpreted as forecasts but  as simply indicative of the direction and magnitude of the effects \nthat might be expected from climate changes. Table 1 below summarizes the estimated impacts \nof increased temperature on the mean level of welfare along with the likely direction of the effects \nof anticipated future climate change on poverty and income inequality.  \nA couple of points are worth highlighting. First, the presented estimates (derived from \nthe country specific elasticities and climate projections) refer to the percentage change in per \ncapita income as a result of climate change relative to a world without it. Second, the direction \nof the poverty impacts due to climate change is derived by assuming a distribution-neutral \nchange in the mean level of welfare. Third, as in the case of per capita income changes, the \nincrease or decrease in poverty refers to a future situation without and with climate change, and \nnot relative to the current situation. Therefore, a prediction that poverty will increase in Brazil \ndoes not imply that poverty will be higher relative to the present, but that it will be higher \nrelative to the no-climate change scenario in 2058. Finally, caution should be  applied when \nlooking  at  the  reported  effects  on  poverty  and  inequality  since  they  are  based  on  the \ndistribution of income (per capita) between municipalities and not households.  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                       \n4  In  four  of  the  five  countries  the  dependent  variable  in  the  analysis  is  income  per  capita,  whereas  in  Bolivia \nconsumption per capita is used. Four explanatory variables are included in the regression models\u2014temperature, \nrainfall, education, and urbanization rates. 6 \n \nTable 1 Summarizing the municipality-level analysis \n  Effect on average \nincomes (% change) \nEffect on \nPoverty \nEffect on \nInequality \nBolivia  2.9  Decrease  Decrease \nBrazil  -11.9  Increase  Increase \nChile  -6.7  Increase  Neutral \nMexico  0  Neutral  Neutral \nPeru  -2.3  Increase  Neutral \n          Source: Andersen and Verner (2010) \n \nAssun\u00e7\u00e3o and Chein Feres (2009) provide an estimate of the poverty impacts of climate \nchange based on cross-sectional data at the municipality level in Brazil. They first estimate the \nimpact of climate change on agricultural productivity (a proxy for the output-climate elasticity) \nmeasured as agricultural output per hectare in each municipality. Next, they use IPCC\u2019s \ntemperature and rainfall projections for 2030-2049 to build a different climate vector for each \nmunicipality, which is then used to obtain the percent change in agricultural productivity \ninduced by climate change. Their estimates suggest that global warming is expected to decrease \nthe agricultural output per hectare in Brazil by 18 percent, with the municipality-specific \nestimates ranging from -40 to +15 percent. \nThe link between agricultural productivity and poverty is explored by means of a cross-\nsectional regression of the poverty rate at the municipality level against the log of the \nagricultural output per hectare and the log of the total population in the municipality. Using \ninstrumental variable methods to account for the correlation between agricultural output and \nthe error term of the regression, they estimate that doubling agricultural productivity reduces \npoverty at the municipality-level by 12.8 percentage points. Based on this estimate they predict \nthat climate change will increase the poverty rate in rural areas by 3.2 percentage points. \nConsidering that the actual poverty rate is 40 percent, the authors claim that the number of poor \nin Brazilian rural areas will increase by 8 percent. The estimates also reveal interesting \ngeographical variations in the poverty impacts of climate change. While the North region will \nbe the most affected area in absolute terms, with an increase of 6.2 percentage points in the rural \npoverty rate, the Southern region appears to benefit from a reduction of 0.9 percentage points in \nthe poverty rate.  7 \n \nIn order to allow for more adaptation options than those considered by the simple \nRicardian approach used in the estimation of the impacts of climate change on agricultural \nproductivity, the authors consider two alternatives. First, they consider a measure of total \npoverty taking into account all residents in each municipality, i.e. including all urban \nhouseholds. This alternative measure of poverty captures the fact that some individuals might \nadapt to the new climate conditions changing sectors or occupations. Second, they build a \nmigration-adjusted poverty measure.5 They then compute a poverty measure using this \nadjusted sample for each municipality, for both urban and rural areas. After allowing for labor \nmobility across sectors or across municipalities, the absolute impact in rural areas reduces from \n3.2 percentage points, for the case without labor mobility, to 2 percentage points.   \nIn sum, these results suggest that climate change is likely to generate heterogeneous \neffects within Brazil with poverty increasing in the already poorer Northeast region and \ndecreasing in the already richer Southern region. Moreover, the poverty impacts of climate \nchange are likely to be lower depending on the extent to which households are able to adapt by \nmigrating across municipalities or switching sectors of employment.  However, the poverty \nestimates of the Assun\u00e7\u00e3o and Chein Feres (2009) study tend to overstate the impacts of climate \nchange on poverty in Brazil since they do not take into account the potential increase in mean \nper capita income due to economic growth over the next forty years. In other words, they \nconsider climate change as it would happen tomorrow, predicting the impact of a warming \nclimate on the actual poverty rate and not the prevailing poverty rate by 2050 in a world \nwithout such a warming. The proper way to present poverty estimates associated with future \nclimate change is to project both output and population growth and then use the elasticities to \npredict its impact on poverty.   \n \n2.2 Accounting for Future Growth: Evidence from Integrated Assessment Models \nAn Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) is a general equilibrium model that relies on \nmicro-evidence to quantify various socio-economic dimensions of climate change and then \naggregate these to produce a net effect on national income. IAMs are utilized extensively in the \nclimate change literature to model climate-economy interactions and form the basis of many \n                                                       \n5 For each municipality, they consider a sample comprised of the non-migrant households and those who out-migrate \nto other municipalities - migrants from other municipalities are also excluded. 8 \n \npolicy recommendations regarding greenhouse gas emissions control. The typical output of an \nIAM is the future trajectories of key economic variables including GDP per capita with and \nwithout climate change, as well as income paths under different policy scenarios.6 \nThe earliest estimates of the impact of climate change on poverty that we are aware of \nare those by Anderson (2006). Anderson estimates the impacts of climate change on poverty for \nSub-Saharan Africa and South Asia based on PAGE 2002 (Policy Analysis Greenhouse Effect).7 \nThe PAGE model provides estimates of output and growth in the future without and with \nclimate change. Under the A2 climate change scenario in which global mean temperature \nincreases by 3.9\u00b0C by 2100, the cost of climate change in India and South East Asia, and in \nAfrica and the Middle East is predicted by PAGE 2002 to be around a 2.5 and 1.9 percent loss in \nGDP, respectively, compared with what could have been achieved in a world without climate \nchange.  Anderson converts these output and growth projections into poverty impacts, by using \nregional poverty-output elasticity estimates, population forecasts, and the two assumptions that \n(i) average household income grows at 0.8 times the rate of GDP per capita8 and (ii) the \ndistribution of income remains constant. Based on these projections, the author reports that by \n2100 climate change could cause up to an additional 12 million people living on less than $2 a \nday in South Asia and an additional 24 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa.9  \nWhile the poverty predictions are based on highly aggregative and simplified model \nthat does not take into account adaptation, the illustrative results suggest that climate change \nwill negatively affect poverty. As the Stern Review (Stern 2007) rightly notes, these poverty \nimpacts are likely to be smaller if aggregate growth in these countries and regions proceeds \nfaster than what is assumed by the IPCC A2 SRES scenario (which assumes, among other \nthings, a high population by 2010 (15 billion) and a world GPD growing at 2 percent per year). \nIn fact, recent GDP and population growth trends suggest that the A2 scenario\u2019s view has been \npessimistic, and hence Anderson\u2019s poverty impacts might overestimate the actual impact.    \n                                                       \n6 For a detailed description of IAMs in the context of climate change control see Kelly and Kolstad (1999). \n7  PAGE is an IAM used extensively by the Stern Review (Stern 2007).  \n8  It is a common practice to multiply the growth rate in GDP by 0.8 so as to get an approximation of the growt h rate \nin consumption. This adjustment factor, however, is not explicitly documented in any published paper that we are \naware of.  \n9  The  Stern  Review  reports  Anderson\u2019s  results  based  on  the  95th  percentile  of  the  climate  change  damage \ndistribution. Under these higher damages by 2100 climate change could cause up to an additional 46 million poor \npeople in South Asia and an additional 98 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa. 9 \n \nIn order to update Anderson\u2019s estimates to more realistic projections we develop three \nscenarios to model the long-term climate change impacts on poverty using the Regional \nIntegrated Model of Climate and the Economy (RICE) developed by Nordhaus (2010). The first \nscenario (baseline) simulates a world without climate change. The second (business as usual \n[BAU]) reflects the impact of current trends in economic growth and greenhouse gas emissions \n(GHGs) on the climate, and the impact of climate change on the overall economy without any \nemission abatement policies.10 The third (optimal abatement) is based on Nordhaus\u2019s \ncalculation of an emission abatement path, with full participation by all countries, which \nmaximizes global intertemporal economic welfare.  \nWe translate the implications of these different growth scenarios for poverty using \nhistorical estimates of growth-poverty elasticities (see the Appendix for details).11 Table 2 \nsummarizes the main impacts of climate change on global poverty under these three scenarios. \nIn a no climate change baseline, the model projects an annual global real per capita output \ngrowth rate of 2.2 percent up to 2055.12 This contributes to more than halving the world poverty \nrate at the $2 a day level to 14.1 percent by 2055. Under the RICE model\u2019s BAU scenario with \nclimate damage, world gross domestic product (GDP) in 2055 would be 1.5 percent lower than \nin the baseline. In the BAU scenario, the estimated number of poor in 2055 would be modestly \nhigher by 10 million, compared to the no climate change scenario, with most of the additional \npoor located in Africa and South Asia. It is worth stressing that this analysis focuses on the \nexpected or mean value of the probability distribution of damage from climate change. \nObviously, looking at lower probability extreme outcomes increases the estimates for GDP \nlosses and poverty. Under the optimal abatement scenario, the extra number of people in \npoverty due to global warming in 2055 is projected to be only slightly smaller: 9 million. That is \n                                                       \n10 It is useful to benchmark Nordhaus\u2019 business as usual scenario against other IAMs. For example, PAGE estimates \nthat the mean loss in world output in 2100 would be 2.9 percent under its high climate change scenario. The RICE \nmodel presumes a somewhat larger 3.3 percent loss in 2105.  Differences in inferences from various models depend \nmore on whether one examines mean impacts of uncertain climate change or the tails of the impact distribution. \n11 Given the limitations in knowledge and large uncertainties surrounding climate change and its impact on economic \ngrowth, and the impacts of growth on poverty, this analysis (as well as Anderson\u2019s) should be viewed as indicative \nonly of the potential consequences of climate change on global poverty. There are profound uncertainties at every \nstage in global warming modeling: uncertainties about future output growth; the pace and direction of technological \nchange, particularly for low carbon energy sources; migration patterns; climatic reaction to rising concentrations of \nGHGs; and about the economic and ecological responses to changing climate and how impacts should be discounted. \n12  Projected annual per capita growth rates by RICE are decreasing over time. The annual world output growth also \nmasks considerable regional disparities; for example, while China and India are expected to grow at a 3.6 annua l per \ncapita rate, the European Union will grow at a 1.8 annual rate. 10 \n \nbecause the effects of abating global emissions of greenhouse gases on aggregate economic \ndamages necessarily accrue more to higher-income countries. Unlike adaptation, emissions \nmitigation does not specifically target the poor. The major gains in poverty averted by following \nthe optimal abatement strategy would indeed occur on a longer time horizon, by 2100 and \nbeyond. \n \nTable 2.

To analyze how \nclimate change will affect specific sectors of the population one needs to use household-level \ndata and explicitly model the channels through which future warming will affect economic \nactivity. \n \n3.  INTRODUCING HETEROGENEITY: MICROECONOMIC APPROACH \nThe discussion so far has relied on the evidence emerging from the relationship between \nclimate (temperature and precipitation) and growth or the level of GDP in a cross section or a \npanel of countries or municipalities within selected countries.  While informative, these studies \ndo not shed any light on the channels through which climate change can impact household \nwelfare. For example, climate change may have a negative effect on agricultural productivity \nand also affect poor people\u2019s livelihood through its effects on health, access to water and natural \nresources, and infrastructure. Considering the complexities involved in modeling some of these \nchannels, the literature has largely focused on the impacts on agricultural output. This section 11 \n \nreviews the quantitative estimates of climate change impacts on poverty through its effects on \nagricultural productivity. \nOver the last few years a large literature has attempted to quantify the impacts of \nclimate change on agricultural productivity at the regional as well as at the country level.13 The \ngeneral consensus emerging from this literature is that climate change will negatively affect \nagricultural productivity and yields, and that the impacts will vary across countries as well as \nwithin countries. To the extent that yield changes are good predictors of the changes in the \nwelfare level of rural households, and ultimately of the changes in the poverty rates at least in \nthe rural areas, these findings suggest that climate change would have significant effects on \npoverty rates. Yet, it is quite plausible that the impacts of climate change on agricultural yields \nmay actually be a rather poor predictor of the poverty impacts of climate change. There is a \nvariety of mediating factors that can mitigate the impacts on the level of household welfare, as \nwell as the distribution of these impacts across different households. The list of such factors \nincludes (among others): the extent of autonomous adaptation by households, such as the \nability to migrate or switch employment between agricultural and nonagricultural occupations, \nthe extent of policy induced adaptation through prices and explicit government programs, such \nas providing access to credit and insurance.14 Also, the distribution of productive endowments \n(irrigated and non-irrigated land, skilled and unskilled labor), and the dual role of rural \nhouseholds as consumers and producers of food -and whether they are net consumers or \nproducers- will determine how the impacts are distributed among the population. Economic \ngrowth, often absent in the discussion of future impacts of a warming world, will have a \ntremendous ameliorating effect through the decrease of the food expenditure share on total \nexpenditure, and the reduction of the relative weight of agriculture in national GDP (Nordhaus \n1993). \n \n \n \n                                                       \n13 See Cline (2007) for a synthesis of impacts reported in the literature, and Hertel and Rosch (2010) for a review of \nmethodologies. \n14 Autonomous adaptation is typically distinguished from planned adaptation, which refers to policy-based actions \nthat are needed when market failures or other coordination problems hinder relevant collective responses to climate \nchange.  12 \n \n3.1 General Equilibrium Modeling \nThe study by Hertel et al. (2010) is an effort to analyze the impacts of climate change \nthrough a more careful modeling of the channels and the heterogeneity of impacts in the \ncontext of economic growth.  They use disaggregated data on household economic activity \n(stratified by their primary source of income) within individual countries (15 developing \ncountries) and a general equilibrium global trade model (Global Trade Analysis Project or \nGTAP) to explore how changes in agricultural productivity will affect poverty in poor \ncountries. Although the extent of heterogeneity allowed by their model is limited, a key feature \nof their model is that allows different type of households to be affected differently by the prices \nof agricultural goods depending on whether they are net producers or net consumers of food.15  \nThey use three scenarios of climate change on agricultural productivity (low, medium, \nor high productivity) to evaluate the resulting changes by 2030 in: (i) global commodity prices, \n(ii) national economic welfare and (iii) the incidence on the poverty headcount rate (defined as \nthe portion of a nation\u2019s population living on less than $1 a day). The poverty consequences \nof a decline in agricultural productivity are evidenced through two channels: changes in earnings \nand changes in the real cost of living at the poverty line. The impact of a food price rise on earnings \ndepends on the income sources for a given household group (these earnings shares are \nestimated from household survey data). If earnings rise faster than the cost of living for \nhouseholds at the poverty line in a given stratum, then the poverty headcount falls and vice \nversa. The responsiveness of the stratum poverty headcount to a given real income shock is \ndetermined by the density of the stratum population in the neighborhood of the poverty line, \nand is also estimated from the household survey data. When combined with information about \nthe distribution of national poverty across socio-economic strata, the authors are able to \nestimate the change in the national poverty headcount. \n                                                       \n15 The authors consider seven types of households based on their primary sources of earnings (i.e., where they earn \n95% of their income): agricultural self-employed (farm income), non-agricultural (non-agricultural self employed \nearnings), urban labor (urban households with wage labor income), rural labor (rural households with wage labor \nincome), transfer payment dependent, and two groups of households with non-specialized income sources (urban \ndiverse and rural diverse). 13 \n \nA number of interesting findings emerge from this modeling effort. First, large \nchanges in grain prices do not translate into large changes in the cost of living.16 This is \nbecause consumers adjust their consumption bundle to account for the new pattern of \nprices and staple grains are only one part of the total consumption bundle. To quote the \nauthors: \u2015while world prices for staple grains rise by an average of more than 30% in the low \nproductivity scenario, the average impact on the real cost of living at the poverty line is more modest \n\u2013just 6.3%.\u2016 Second, the portion of the poverty change driven by the changes in the cost of \nliving (the product of the percentage change in the real cost of living at the poverty line and \nthe stratum-specific elasticity of poverty with respect to real income) are largest for the \nurban wage labor household stratum. This is because the density around the poverty line in \nthe urban wage labor household stratum is relatively high. In contrast, the agriculture-\ndependent households show the smallest change.17 Third, in the \u2015low productivity\u2016 \nscenario (higher temperature), rising world commodity prices translate into increased \nreturns to factors employed in agriculture. Consequently, they report a sharp increase in \nearnings and a drop in the poverty rate for the agricultural self-employed households. On \nthe other hand, poverty rises for the non-agricultural specialized households, the returns to \nwhich fall due to the decline in the relative price of non-agriculture commodities, compared \nto agriculture goods. Under the \u2015high productivity\u2016 scenario these results are reversed, \nwith no apparent effect on poverty for the medium climate change scenario. Fourth, the \ncombined poverty impacts on agricultural self-employed households are positively \ncorrelated with the size of the productivity shock \u2013with lower global productivity \ngenerating higher agricultural prices and reduced poverty amongst these households. The \nopposite is true of the non-agricultural self-employed households. The net change in \nnational poverty depends on the contribution of each stratum to overall poverty. \nIn sum, the overall, and by-stratum, poverty changes across all countries for the low-\nproductivity climate change scenario illustrate that nearly all countries have some strata \n                                                       \n16 Another feature of their model is that all households in each region face the same prices and have the same \npreferences. Therefore the change in the estimated real cost of living at the poverty line is the same across strata for \nany given country. \n17  Differences in impact of cost of living changes on poverty for different types of households are a result of \ndifferences in poverty elasticities across strata within each country. 14 \n \nwhere poverty is increased and others where poverty is decreased. The notable exceptions \nare most African countries where yield impacts of climate change are severe and no single \nstratum experiences significant poverty reductions. \nThe study by Hertel et al (2010) provides a promising approach for studying the impacts \nof climate change taking into account general equilibrium effects between agricultural \nproductivity, cost of living, and earnings effects. However, as is the case for most models, there \nare serious trade-offs associated between the tractability of the general equilibrium effects and \nthe heterogeneity incorporated into the model.  \n \n3.2 Heterogeneity Galore \nThe study by Jacoby, Rabassa, and Skoufias (2011) applies a flexible framework for \nquantifying the distributional impacts of climate change in rural economies.  In this study \nwelfare is measured by consumption per capita and is modeled as being determined by the \nresource endowments of the household, such as land and labor, and the returns from farm and \nnon-farm activities.18 Using a comparative statics framework, the impacts of climate change on \nhousehold consumption can be expressed as the impact of changes in temperature on the \nreturns to land (used as a summary measure of agricultural productivity) multiplied by the \nproportion of income derived from owned land, the impacts of temperature on the returns to \nlabor multiplied by the proportion of income derived from labor, and the impacts of climate \nchange on the price of food multiplied by the net consumption ratio, i.e. the value of the net \nmarketed surplus of food by the household.19  \nUsing micro data representative for all India and following the Ricardian approach \nproposed by Mendelsohn et al. (1994) the authors estimate the impacts of climate change in 2040 \non agricultural productivity and wages taking into account adaptation (i.e. using district-level \ncross sectional data) and assuming imperfect mobility of labor.20  They are also able to estimate \n                                                       \n18  Additional  heterogeneity  is introduced  into  the  model  by  distinguishing  between  the  type  of  land  owned  by \nhouseholds  (irrigated  vs.  non-irrigated)  and  different  types  of  labor  (skilled  and  unskilled).  Each  of  these \nendowments may have different returns and responses to climate.  \n19 It should also be noted, that the impacts of climate change are derived based on the current stock and distribution \nof endowments of land and labor. \n20 The effect of climate change on the price of cereals in India is obtained from the ENVISAGE (Environmental Impact \nand Sustainability Applied General Equilibrium), a multi-sector computable general equilibrium model developed at \nthe World Bank for assessing  climate change effects and policies. The model predicts that cereal prices will rise \napproximately 10 percent by 2040 due to warming. 15 \n \nthe impacts of climate change on agricultural productivity in the absence of adaptation using \npanel data at the district level (Deschenes and Greenstone 2007). Combining these estimates of \nthe impacts of climate change on the returns to land and labor with the household specific \ninformation on endowments of land and labor, one is able to derive household-specific impacts \nof the climate change on consumption which is a prerequisite for a proper distributional \nanalysis.21   \nThe main results emerging from the study of Jacoby et al. (2011) are as follows: First, the \nsubstantial fall in agricultural productivity (17 percent overall inclusive of adaptation) that is \npredicted as a result of warming will translate into a much more modest consumption decline \n(of 6 percent on average) for the majority of households. This is because these households \nderive the bulk of their income from wage employment and (rural) wages are estimated to fall \nby only a third as much as agricultural productivity. The same general pattern is observed in \nthe case of no adaptation.22 Second, climate change will have heterogeneous impacts across \ngeographical areas and across the income distribution (see Figure 1). Ignoring cereal price \neffects, climate change appears \"progressive\" insofar as wealthier households suffer \nproportionally greater consumption losses. A household in the top percentile of the per capita \nexpenditure distribution would experience nearly a two percentage point greater decline in \nconsumption than a household in the bottom percentile. This progressivity is driven by the \nskewed land distribution and the fact that larger landowners are concentrated in the higher \npercentiles. By contrast, temperature-induced wage declines are relatively more costly to the \npoor than to the rich, mainly because the poor tend to engage in climate sensitive agricultural \nemployment. Third, once the welfare effects or rising cereal prices are taken into account; \nclimate change impacts are regressive, falling more heavily on the poor than the rich. This is \ntrue in urban areas, where it is assumed that cereal price effects are the only welfare \nconsequence of climate change, as well as in rural areas, where the beneficial impact of higher \nprices to agricultural producers offsets the decline in land productivity. \n                                                       \n21  Thus, in contrast to the seven types of households considered in Hertel et al. (2010)  in this model there is a \ncontinuum of households.  \n22 The estimates show that in the absence of adaptation a 1 degree Celsius increase in annual temperature reduces \ngross productivity per hectare in the range between 24 and 31 percent, which translate into a much smaller decline in \nconsumption between 10.9 and 11.3 percent. \n 16 \n \n \nFigure 1 Climate change incidence curves for rural population in India \nSource: Jacoby, Rabassa, and Skoufias (2011) \n \nWhile the model employed by Jacoby, Rabassa, and Skoufias (2011) is primarily \nequipped for estimating the distributional rather than the poverty impacts of climate change, \npredictions about poverty impacts can be derived with the help of some additional \nassumptions. As discussed above, in estimating the poverty impacts of climate change it is \nimportant to take into account the growth in the economy over time and the associated decline \nin the share of food in household consumption. Table 3 underscores the importance of this point \nby estimating the poverty rates in 2040 assuming different annual growth rates in the level of \nthe average standard of living. Even with a very low growth rate in the level of mean \nconsumption (equal to the average growth rates in mean consumption in India between 1951 \nand 1990), urban poverty in the presence of climate change is likely to be more than half  (at a \nlevel of 15.7%) of the poverty rate in urban areas in the base year (32.3%).23 \n \n \n                                                       \n23 It is important to keep in mind that, in India, the mean level of aggregate household expenditure in the National \nSample Survey (NSS) accounts for only 60% of the private consumption expenditure from the National Accounts \n(Ravallion, 2003).  Regarding the growth rate in mean consumption in India, it is a common practice to multiply the \ngrowth rate in GDP by 0.8 so as to get an approximation of the growth rate in consumption (see footnote 7).  17 \n \nTable 3 Predicted poverty rates with climate change \n  Base Year  No Growth \nLow \nGrowth \nMedium \nGrowth \nHigh \nGrowth \n  2004/05  2040  2040  2040  2040 \nRural  48.8  54.8  35.8  18.3  2.1 \nUrban  31.1  32.3  15.7  5.8  0.2 \nAll  44.5  49.4  31  15.3  1.1 \nNotes: Annual growth rates in mean consumption derived from several NSS rounds are drawn from \nDatt and Ravallion (2011).

Erratic weather and increased climatic variability will affect agricultural productivity \nwhich, depending on how effective was the portfolio of ex ante and ex post risk management 18 \n \nstrategies employed by households in urban and rural areas, may translate into reduced income \nand reduced food availability at the household level. \nNumerous studies have examined the impacts of natural disasters and extreme weather-\nrelated shocks on different dimensions of welfare (see Baez and Mason 2008, and World Bank \n2010b for a thorough review of this literature). In general, they all show that agricultural \nincomes and, thus, food, basic non-food consumption and investments in human capital, health, \nnutrition and productive physical assets are likely to be negatively affected by extreme weather \nevents. Many of these studies however, tend to rely on the perceptions of respondents about the \nincidence of different types of shocks or use data on rainfall and temperature as a tool (e.g. as \ninstrumental variables) to analyze the effect of shocks to income on other outcomes, such as \nconsumption or investments in human capital.24 Hardly any studies use actual weather data to \nanalyze the general relationship between weather and the level of welfare. A recent study by \nSkoufias, Vinha, and Conroy (2011) examines whether climatic variability, namely deviations of \nrainfall and temperature from their long run means, have significant impacts on the average \nwellbeing of rural households in Mexico. They report that the timing of the rainfall or \ntemperature shock results in a substantial difference in its estimated impact on welfare. For \nexample, per capita expenditures are 14 percent higher if the prior agricultural year (October to \nSeptember of next calendar year) was at least one standard deviation drier than the average of \nthe last 35 years (1951-1985). However, if the rainfall shock were to be defined within the time \nframe of the wet season (April to September) then neither positive nor negative rainfall shocks \nduring that wet season appear to have any significant effect on household per capita \nexpenditures.  \nIn a study building on these insights, Skoufias, Essama-Nssah, and Katayama (2011) use \ndata from rural Indonesia and consider two rainfall-related shocks: (i) a delay in the onset of \nmonsoon and (ii) a significant shortfall in the amount of rain in the 90-day post-monsoon \nperiod.  Focusing on households with family farm businesses, they find that rice farm \nhouseholds located in areas experiencing low rainfall following the onset of the monsoon are \nnegatively affected. A shortfall in the amount of rainfall in the post onset period is associated \nwith a 14 percent reduction in the per capita expenditures of rice farmers. Rice farm households \n                                                       \n24  There is a large literature on the extent to which short-term weather shocks in poor rural areas can have long-term \neffects on education, health, and nutrition, especially of children. For a recent review of these studies see Baez and \nMason (2008).  19 \n \nmanage to protect their food expenditures in the face of weather shocks at the expense of \nnonfood expenditures. The findings regarding the impacts of climatic variability on non-food \nconsumption expenditures are consistent with households reducing their expenditures on \nhealth and education. These types of expenditures may ultimately have a longer-term effect on \npoverty through the reduced investment on the human capital of children.   \nThe study also sheds light on some potential policy instruments that might moderate the \nwelfare impact of climate change.  Access to credit and public works projects in communities \ncan help households cope with shocks and thereby play a strong protective role from weather-\nrelated shocks. This is an important consideration for the design and implementation of \nadaptation strategies. \nThe preceding studies focus on the impacts of weather-related shocks on the mean level \nof welfare, though not necessarily poverty. The negative effects on welfare suggest that the \ncurrent risk-coping mechanisms have a limited capacity in protecting welfare from erratic \nweather patterns. Considering that coping mechanisms are backward looking in the sense that \nthey develop over time based on weather variability observed over very long periods of time, \nthere is a concern about the extent to which they can adjust to the changes in climatic variability \npredicted over the next 50 to 90 years. All in all, these observations imply that the change in the \npatterns of climatic variability predicted is likely to reduce the effectiveness of the current \ncoping mechanisms even more and thus increase household vulnerability and poverty further. \nAhmed et al. (2009) is the only study to date making an effort to model the channels and \nestimate the poverty impacts of extreme weather events such as extreme heat, droughts and \nfloods.  They employ the GTAP comparative static computable general equilibrium model. The \nmodel, which is practically identical to that in Hertel et al. (2010) discussed above, is applied to \n16 countries. The main difference is the origin of the shocks to agriculture, which in this paper is \nderived from three different sources: (i) the percent of annual total precipitation due to events \nexceeding the 1961\u20131990 95th percentile; (ii) the maximum number of consecutive dry days; and \n(iii) the heat wave duration index.  20 \n \nThey analyze 30-year periods from 1971 to 2000 in the 20th century, and 2071 to 2100 in \nthe simulations under the IPCC\u2019s A2 scenario.25  All sixteen countries exhibit substantial \nincreases in the occurrence and magnitude of extreme hot events, with the occurrence of the \npresent 30-year-maximum event increasing more than 2700% in parts of the northern \nMediterranean, and the magnitude of the 30-year-maximum event increasing 1000% to more \nthan 2250% in much of central Africa. Most countries also display increases in the occurrence \nand magnitude of extreme dry events, with peak changes of greater than 800% and 60% \n(respectively) occurring over Mediterranean Europe. \nThe magnitude and spatial heterogeneity of changes in climate volatility suggest that the \nimpacts on poverty could also be large and heterogeneous. Among the 16 countries they \nanalyze, those with the highest shares of populations entering poverty due to these extreme \nevents include Bangladesh, Mexico, Mozambique, Malawi, Tanzania, and Zambia.  For \nexample, in Malawi and Zambia, simulated grains productivity declines of about 75 percent \ncause the poverty headcount to increase by about seven percentage points relative to their total \npopulations. There is also tremendous heterogeneity in the poverty vulnerability across \ndifferent segments of the population (differentiated by primary income source). As in Hertel et \nal. (2010) the analysis also reveals that the most vulnerable group is the urban wage-labor \ndependent stratum. While the urban labor group contributes modestly to total poverty in the \nsample of 16 countries analyzed here, it appears to be highly vulnerable to extreme climate \nevents (e.g. in Malawi, the poverty rate for this group doubles). Zambia and Mexico also show \nhigh vulnerability among this group.  The source of vulnerability of the urban poor is their \nextreme exposure to food price increases (with food being a major expenditure, their group\u2019s \nconsumption falls with rising prices, pushing them below the poverty threshold of \nconsumption). Agricultural households, on the other hand are much less exposed. While they \nare generally hurt by the adverse productivity shock as consumers, they tend to benefit from \nthe higher food prices as producers. \nGiven that the shares of developing countries populations living in rural areas are \nprojected to decrease by more than one third between 2010 and 2050 (United Nations 2009), \n                                                       \n25 As previously discussed, the A2 SRES Scenarios might not truthfully represent the expected GDP and population \ngrowth, and the consequential emissions path. As a result, it is an extreme scenario which overestimates the negative \nimpact that climate change will have on poverty reduction efforts. 21 \n \nclimate extremes may have greater national-scale poverty impacts in the future because of \nhigher population concentrations in the more sensitive urban strata.  \nThe poverty impacts estimated above are based on simple approximations of how \nextreme climate events influence poverty by affecting agricultural productivity and raising \nprices of staple foods. However, it is important to bear in mind that there is an extensive \nliterature that documents that the presence of weather variability (in the absence of credit and \ninsurance markets) is associated with a set of risk management strategies (ex ante and ex-post) by \nrural households aimed at protecting household welfare. For example, rural households may \nundertake ex-ante income-smoothing strategies and adopt low return - low risk crop and asset \nportfolios (Rosenzweig and Binswanger 1993).   Households may use their savings (Paxson, \n1992), take loans from the formal financial sector to carry them through the difficult times (Udry \n1994), sell assets (Deaton 1992), or diversify the portfolio of occupations held by the adult \nmembers of the household (Menon 2009). These actions enable households to spread the effects \nof weather-induced shocks through time. Additional strategies include the management of \nincome risk through ex-post adjustments such as sending children to work instead of school in \norder to supplement income (Jacoby and Skoufias 1997), adjustments in labor supply such as \nholding multiple jobs, and engaging in other informal economic activities (Morduch 1995; \nKochar 1999). As Elbers, Gunning, and Kinsey (2007) demonstrate, these risk management \nstrategies themselves are associated with increased poverty, and lower investment and growth \n(i.e. poverty traps).  The reason for this is due to the fact that poor households that are credit \nconstrained will choose activities that reduce the variance of their incomes, but that also have \nlower expected incomes than the activities chosen by wealthier (less constrained) households.   \n \n4.  KEY MESSAGES AND POLICY CONSIDERATIONS  \nWhile the studies surveyed are quite heterogeneous in terms of data (country level vs. \nhousehold level, and cross sectional vs. panel data), methods (partial equilibrium vs. \ncomputable general equilibrium), and focus (regional vs. country-specific), there are a number \nof messages that can be extracted:  \n\uf0b7  Most estimates of the poverty impacts of climate change tend to ignore the effect of aggregate \neconomic growth on poverty and household welfare. Thus many of the estimates of the poverty \nimpacts provide a very pessimistic, if not unrealistic, scenario. However, it is also important 22 \n \nto bear in mind that the extent to which the high growth and the associated large poverty \nreduction rates of the recent past can be sustained in the future depend critically on whether \nhigh growth rates can be maintained by burning less fossil fuels. \n\uf0b7  Climate change will slow the pace of global poverty reduction, but\u2014based on the mean or \nexpected value of climate damages used in mainstream analyses such as Nordhaus\u2019s (2010) \nRICE model or the Stern Review (Stern 2007)\u2014the expected poverty impact will be \nrelatively modest and far from reversing the major decline in poverty that is expected to \noccur over the next 40 years as a result of continued economic growth. However, a number \nof qualifications are in order: First, much of the poverty impact is expected to be \nconcentrated in Africa and South Asia, both of which would see more substantial increases \nin poverty relative to a baseline without climate change. Second, the occurrence of less \nprobable but more extreme climate damage scenarios would naturally result in larger \npoverty increases. Third, aggregate projected damages are relatively low over the time \nhorizon analyzed in this note (mid-century). As climate change continues to unfold during \nthis and the next century, aggregate damages could be substantial and have a larger effect \non poverty. \n\uf0b7  The estimated impacts of climate change on agricultural yields are generally a poor predictor of the \npoverty impacts of climate change at the national level. The evidence from the studies that have \nbeen carried out so far and reviewed here suggest that the decline in agricultural \nproductivity resulting from climate change translates in much smaller increases in poverty \nat the national level. This is primarily due to two factors: (i) heterogeneity in how climate \nchange impacts on different geographical areas within countries as well as across the \nnational income distribution; and (ii) heterogeneity in the ability of households to adapt, i.e. \nmoving across space and across sector of employment. It is important to keep in mind that \nthe heterogeneity of impacts of climate change across space is not synonymous to \nheterogeneity in the ability of households to adapt (ex-ante or ex-post) to the changes in \nclimate.  \n\uf0b7  It also appears that the impacts of climate change are generally regressive, i.e. falling more heavily \non the poor than the rich. The impacts of the higher food prices associated with the global \nincrease in temperatures are likely to have different effects on households who are net \nproducers of food compared to households who are net consumers of food. Net producers 23 \n \nare likely to benefit from higher prices while net consumers are likely to be hurt. Although \nthere is a great deal of uncertainty about whether the global decline in agricultural \nproductivity is likely to translate to large increases in grain prices, there is some evidence \nthat increases in grain prices of the order of 30 percent by 2030 translate into \nconsiderable smaller changes in the cost of living for those households close to the \npoverty line. The increasing urbanization suggests that the number of net consumers of \nfood is likely to increase substantially over the next few decades. This suggests that the \ngradual global warming, as well as the increased incidence of extreme weather resulting \nfrom climate change, is likely to hurt urban wage labor much more than rural labor \n(self-employed in agriculture). \nFortunately, many of the policies that can be effective at reducing the impacts of climate change \non poverty are not different from the strategies of sound development agendas aimed at \nreducing poverty and promoting economic growth. The most important elements of such \npolicies include: Smoothing the price impacts of regional or country-specific climate shocks \nthrough international trade; investing in human capital to increase employment opportunities \nof the poor, accompanied by policies and incentives that facilitate the migration of the poor to \nthe areas with better economic opportunities; providing credit and developing insurance \nmarkets; investing in transportation and communication infrastructure; investing in irrigation \nand/or improved water management to deal with extreme precipitation events; investing in \nadaptive agricultural research and in information and extension services; improving \ngovernance of common-pool natural resources; and creating well targeted and scalable safety \nnets systems. .  The regressive impacts of climate change alluded to above combined with the \nemerging evidence that access to social protection and credit programs moderate the welfare \nimpacts of climate change suggest that the establishment of safety net programs and the \nstrengthening of the institutions needed for the implementation and scaling-up of such \nprograms should be a critical component of country-level adaptation strategies.  In particular, \nsafety net systems that are counter-cyclical, such as conditional and unconditional cash \ntransfers, workfare programs (e.g., food or cash-for work), and social funds (community-level \nprograms in infrastructure, social services, training, etc.) can have immediate pay-offs  since \nthey enable countries to deal with economic crises and other shocks that may not be related to \nclimate change and climatic variability. 24 \n \nREFERENCES \n \nAhmed, S., N.

Natural Hazards and Unnatural Disasters: The Economics of Effective Prevention. \nWashington, DCAPPENDIX  \nThe poverty impacts of climate change using RICE \n \n26 \n \n \nI. Methodology \nIn order to project the impacts of climate change on poverty it is necessary to estimate: \n(i) how climate change is going to impact the welfare measure (i.e. per capita GDP, or per capita \nPrivate Consumption Expenditure (PCE) from National Account Statistics, or household mean \nincome), and (ii) how these changes in welfare measures translate into poverty numbers. \nFocusing on the second relation, a simple and straightforward concept is the poverty-\ngrowth elasticity. This relationship is derived from the fact that any poverty measure, such as \nthe headcount ratio, can be expressed (for a given poverty line) as a function of the mean of the \ndistribution and the parameters of the Lorenz curve26 \n \n      \n   \n \n \n     \n \nwhere H is the headcount index, z is the poverty line, \uf06d is the mean of the distribution, L is the \nLorenz curve for a given distribution, and \uf070 is a vector of parameters associated to L. \nDifferentiating the previous equation with respect to time we obtain the dynamic counterpart: \n \n  \n \n   \n   \n   \n  \n   \n  \n \n \n   \n  \n  \n       \n \nwhich shows how changes in poverty relate either to economic growth or to changes in the \nLorenz curve. The first term on the RHS, also known as the growth component, can be \nestimated with a regression of the proportionate changes in poverty on the proportionate \nchanges in the welfare measure, with or without controls (X): \n \n  \n \n        \n  \n \n           \n                                                       \n26  For further details see Ferreira (2010). APPENDIX  \nThe poverty impacts of climate change using RICE \n \n27 \n \nwhere \uf062 is the poverty-growth elasticity with respect to the mean consumption given by \uf06d.27 For \nconsistency, we replace the household mean income or consumption by the per capita private \nconsumption component (PCE) in the estimation of the parameter of interest. This empirical \ndecision was made because projections from the RICE model are available only for PCE per \ncapita. \nThere exist differences between estimating the poverty-growth elasticity based on \nhousehold mean income or per capita PCE. Figure A1.a shows the proportionate changes in the \npoverty rate against the rate of growth of average income. The overall poverty-growth elasticity \n(defined as $2 a day PPP) is -2.02 with a (heteroskedasticity corrected) standard error of 0.82. In \ncontrast, Figure A1.b plots the proportionate changes in the same poverty rate against the \ngrowth rate in PCE per capita. Though similar, the estimated elasticity of -1.44 (standard error \nof 0.60) is not as strong as before.28 It is important to note that these estimations are based on the \nsame countries and time spells, in order to make both welfare measures comparable across both \nspace and time.29 \n \nII. The Data \nThe data requirement for this exercise might be divided into two: historical data and \nprojections. Historical data are needed to compute the poverty-growth elasticity. For this \npurpose we construct a dataset with the following variables: poverty measure ($2 a day \nheadcount ratio), household mean income or expenditure, and per capita PCE. Our dataset \nincludes 91 countries; 75 of them have at least two surveys from the early 1990\u2019s until 2000 (last \nyear available). Table A1 lists the countries and survey dates used in the simulation.  \nFollowing Ravallion and Chen (1997), we define a \u2015spell\u2016 as the maximum distance \nbetween two surveys for one country within the time range defined above. We restrict the \nsample of countries\u2019 poverty measure and mean income (or expenditure) to those years which \n                                                       \n27 This parameter could take any sign and magnitude depending on how the distribution changes with economic \ngrowth. In other words, the Lorenz curve is not constant over time (see Ravallion and Chen 1997). \n28 These results are similar to those estimated by Ravallion (2001): a  -2.50 growth elasticity of poverty based on \nconsumption versus a -1.96 elasticity based on PCE per capita. However, caution must be taken in this comparison \nbecause these elasticities were computed for $1 a day at 1993 purchasing power parity. \n29 The PCE per capita has other measurement problems: survey periods do not match exactly the periods used in \nNational Accounts. At the same time, changes in PCE can arise solely from the non-household sector of the economy \nRavallion and Chen (1997), Ravallion (2001) and Ravallion (2003). APPENDIX  \nThe poverty impacts of climate change using RICE \n \n28 \n \nwere computed over the same measure of living standards and area. In some cases, different \nsub-periods use different measures for a given country; for instance, surveys may switch from \nincome to consumption or extend the survey sample from urban to country \nrepresentativeness.30 Given that we are computing poverty-growth elasticities based on PCE we \ncomplete the dataset with the per capita household expenditure PPP in 2005 constant terms. All \nrates of change are compound annual rates.31  \nIn order to maintain consistency we grouped countries according to the RICE\u2019s \nclassification. For a same reason we estimate the poverty-growth elasticities based on PCE \ninstead of mean household income: climate change projections from RICE are available only for \nper capita consumption.  \nA second dataset includes per capita consumption projections from 2005 until 2055 by \n10-year intervals based on the 2010 runs of the RICE model (Nordhaus 2010). From this model \nwe obtain growth rate trajectories for two scenarios under climate change: business as usual \n(BAU) and optimal abatement. The BAU scenario assumes that no climate-change policies are \nadopted. In contrast, under the optimal scenario those climate-change policies that maximize \nglobal economic welfare are adopted, with full participation by all nations starting in 2010. \nThese two macro projections are net of climate-change damages and abatement costs. In order \nto make these scenarios comparables we create a baseline scenario without climate change \nbased on RICE 2010.32 We modify the present investment as a function of the gross present \noutput instead of the present output net of abatement and climate change.33  \n \nIII. Simulation Results \nFigure A2 shows how PCE is affected by climate change according to RICE projections. Every \nscenario presents positive annual growth rates for the rest of the century with a decreasing \ntrend. However, the growth gap widens between the no climate change and the optimal or BAU \nscenarios.  Table A2 presents estimations of poverty-growth elasticities for different countries \n                                                       \n30 Data was obtained from POVCALNET. \n31 Annualized differences in logs gave similar results (see Ravallion, 1997). \n32 Abatement costs are zero in the baseline scenario. \n33 Rice model assume that saving rates remain constant. APPENDIX  \nThe poverty impacts of climate change using RICE \n \n29 \n \nand regions.34 All coefficients are negative meaning that a higher PCE per capita will translate \ninto lower poverty rates. However, some regions respond faster to economic growth than \nothers. For instance, with a 2% annual rate of growth and an initial headcount index of 40%; in a \nrelatively  inelastic  region  such  as  Africa  (with  a  growth  poverty  elasticity  of  -0.45)  the \nheadcount index will fall by less than 1% per year (or 0.35 percentage points in the fir st year). \nThe headcount index will be halved in approximately 78 years. By contrast, in a relatively more \nelastic region such as Latin America with an elasticity of -1.35 which triples Africa\u2019s elasticity, it \nwill take about 26 years to halve the initial poverty rate. \nTables A3 and A4 present poverty projections (measured as the number of people living \nbelow $2 a day poverty line) under BAU and optimal scenarios compared to the no climate \nchange scenario for each region/country. In the absence of global warming the world\u2019s \nheadcount ratio will fall more than 50 percent during the next fifty years, implying that 1.26 \nbillion people will remain in poverty. Most of these them will be located in India and Africa. In \nabsolute terms, climate change would result in an additional 10 and 9.4 million poor globally by \nmid-century for the BAU and the optimal scenarios respectively. The poverty impacts of climate \nchange also show regional disparities, with India and Africa being the most affected.  \nFigure A3 shows the additional number of people in the world living in poverty for the \nbaseline and optimal scenarios in relation to a world without global warming. Both curves are \nupward sloping throughout the century implying that climate change will have a negative \nimpact on poverty. In particular, under the BAU scenario there will be about 10 million more \npeople living in poverty by 2055 than otherwise would have been under no climate change. The \noptimal trajectory (based on climate change policies that maximize inter-temporal welfare) \nshows a higher incidence of poverty in the near future as more resources are diverted towards \n                                                       \n34 The use of poverty-growth elasticities to estimate climate change impacts has some appealing features but it also \nhas several limitations that must be taken into account when interpreting results. Even though other approaches, \nsuch  as  Bhalla  (2002)  and  Hillebrand  (2008),  take  into  account  distributional  changes,  we  are  assuming  an \nunchanging within-country distribution of per capita income over time. In other words, we are not differentiating \nbetween growth and redistribution effects on poverty. We adopt this assumption mainly for two reasons. First, most \nempirical evidence found that the poor on average tend to share proportionately in the gains from economic growth \nand this outweighed the impact of changes in the distribution (Datt and Ravallion 1992, Ravallion 2001, Dollar and \nKraay  2002,  Kraay  2006  and  Ravallion  2007).  Second,  there  is  little  scientific  basis  for  predicting  long-run \ndistributional  changes  (Chen  and  Ravallion  2004).  At  the  same,  we  are  assuming  that  the  relationship  between \ngrowth  and  poverty  (i.e.  the  poverty-growth  elasticity)  for  the  next  fifty  years  will  remain  constant.  These  two \nassumptions are indeed very restrictive, especially as we project poverty impacts for the distant future.

In 2001 theIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Changeconcluded that there is new and stronger evi-dence that most of the warming observedover the past 50 years is attributable tohuman activities (Albritton and Meiro Filho2001). The Intergovernmental Panel onClimate Change projected that the globalmean temperature of the earth would increaseby the end of the 21st century by between 1.4and 5.8\u00b0C. Global precipitation patterns willalso change. This projected rate of warming ismuch faster than the observed changes duringthe 20th century and is very likely to be with-out precedent during at least the last 10,000years (Albritton and Meiro Filho 2001).The primary international response tocontrol greenhouse gas emissions is the KyotoProtocol negotiated under the United NationsFramework Convention on Climate Change(UNFCCC 2005). The text of the protocolwas adopted at the third session of theConference of the Parties to the UNFCCC inKyoto, Japan, on 11 December 1997 andentered into force on 16 February 2005.Because of the long lifetime of some green-house gases and the inherent inertia in the cli-mate system, even full compliance with theKyoto protocol means that adaptation to cli-mate change will be required for at least sev-eral decades (Albritton and Meiro Filho2001). Recent research and policy attentionhas therefore focused on assessments of poten-tial vulnerabilities and identification of adap-tation strategies, policies, and measures (Limand Spanger-Siegfried 2004; Willows andConnell 2003).Three broad categories of health impactsare associated with climatic conditions:impacts that are directly related to weather/climate, impacts that result from environmen-tal changes that occur in response to climaticchange, and impacts resulting from conse-quences of climate-induced economic disloca-tion, environmental decline, and conflict(McMichael et al. 2001). Changes in the fre-quency and intensity of heat events andextreme rainfall events (i.e., floods anddroughts) will directly affect population health.Indirect impacts will occur through changes inthe range and intensity of infectious diseasesand food- and waterborne diseases, andchanges in the prevalence of diseases associatedwith air pollutants and aeroallergens.Concerns about climate change have ledinternational agencies, nongovernmental andregional institutions, and national organiza-tions to undertake vulnerability and adaptationassessments. Few national communicationsand other UNFCCC-related assessments inlow-income countries and economies in transi-tion have addressed climate change\u2013relatedhealth impacts in any detail because of limiteddata availability and a lack of guidance onassessment methods (Kovats et al. 2003a). Toprovide such guidance, and in response to theneed to develop a flexible approach for coun-try-driven health assessments, we developed aframework using familiar methods to evaluatethe impacts of climate variability and change,to identify vulnerable populations, and toassess adaptation policies and measures (Kovatset al. 2003b). The assessment process is stake-holder driven and, as such, is designed to focuson local environmental and health priorities.In this article we first define vulnerabilityand adaptation in the context of climatechange. We next describe the steps in a vul-nerability and adaptation assessment. Third,we discuss issues related to the process of con-ducting an assessment. We then expand onusing risk management to address climatechange\u2013related health risks. A starting pointfor many climate change assessments should beevaluation of how populations currently copewith climate variability, particularly weatherextremes such as floods, droughts, and heatevents, to indicate where additional interven-tions are needed. Improving the capacity tocope with current climate variability will likelyincrease resilience to climate change.The remaining articles in this mini-monograph describe completed assessments insmall island states (Ebi et al. 2006), Portugal(Casimiro et al. 2006), Cuba (Ort\u00edz Bult\u00f3 et al.2006), and the indigenous populations inCanada (Furgal and Seguin 2006). In addition,Campbell-Lendrum and Woodruff (2006)describe methods that the World HealthOrganization (WHO) use to estimate theattributable burden of health determinants andoutcomes due to climate change.Vulnerability and AdaptationAssessing the potential health impacts ofclimate variability and change requires under-standing both the vulnerability of a populationand its capacity to respond to new conditions.This article is part of the mini-monograph \u201cClimateChange and Human Health: National Assessmentsof Impacts and Adaptation.\u201dAddress correspondence to K.L.

Environ Health Perspect 114:1930\u20131934 (2006). doi:10.1289/ehp.8430 available viahttp://dx.doi.org/ [Online 11 July 2006]Human health vulnerability to climate canbe defined as a function of a) sensitivity, whichincludes the extent to which health, or the nat-ural or social systems on which health out-comes depend, are sensitive to changes inweather and climate (the exposure\u2013responserelationship) and the characteristics of the pop-ulation, such as its demographic structure;b) the exposure to the climate-related hazard,including the character, magnitude, and rate ofclimate variation; and c) the adaptation mea-sures and actions in place to reduce the burdenof a specific adverse health outcome (the adap-tation baseline), the effectiveness of which mayinfluence the exposure\u2013response relationship.Adaptation includes the strategies, policies,and measures (hereafter referred to as adapta-tion options) undertaken now and in thefuture to reduce the burden of climate-sensitivehealth determinants and outcomes. Adaptationcan be anticipatory (actions taken in advanceof climate change) or responsive and canencompass both spontaneous responses to cli-mate variability and change by affected indi-viduals and planned responses by governmentsor other institutions (Smit et al. 2001). Anexample of a public health adaptation is anearly warning system for heat events.Table 1 provides definitions and examplesof coping and adaptive capacity. Copingcapacity encompasses the interventions that arefeasible to implement today (in a specific pop-ulation), and adaptive capacity encompassesthe strategies and policies that have the poten-tial to expand future coping capacity (Yoheand Ebi 2005). The primary goal of buildingadaptive capacity is to reduce future vulnera-bility to climate variability and change.Increasing the adaptive capacity of a popula-tion shares goals similar to those for sustain-able development\u2014increasing the ability ofcountries, communities, and individualsto effectively and efficiently cope with thechallenges of climate change.An adaptation assessment describes specificoptions that can be implemented to reducecurrent and future vulnerability as well as theresources needed (financial, technologic, andhuman capital) to implement them. The infor-mation generated from an adaptation assess-ment can be combined with a cost\u2013benefitanalysis or other decision support tool toinform priority setting by policy makers (e.g.,Willows and Connell 2003).Steps in a Vulnerability andAdaptation AssessmentAssessment of vulnerability and adaptationuses concepts similar to those used in healthimpact assessments. Not all steps may be pos-sible or desirable in a particular assessment,and the determination of which steps to beincluded depends on the objectives andresources available. Assessments can have dif-ferent levels of in-depth analysis depending onthe objectives, the interest of stakeholders, andthe funding available.Determine the scope of the assessment. Thefirst step is to specify the scope of the assess-ment in relation to the health issues of concerntoday and of potential risk in the future, thegeographic region to be covered by the assess-ment, and the time period. The responsiblenational or regional health authority can iden-tify the health outcomes to be included in col-laboration with, when appropriate, a) theauthorities responsible for the social security,environmental affairs, and meteorologic offices;b) the research community; and c) other stake-holders such as nongovernmental organiza-tions, business, and the public.Describe current associations between dis-ease outcomes and climate variability andchange. This step involves describing the cur-rent burden and recent trends in the incidenceand prevalence of climate-sensitive healthdeterminants and outcomes of importance inthe population of interest and the reportedassociations between weather/climate and thehealth outcomes of concern. The associationsmay be based on routine statistics collected bynational agencies or on published literature.Meteorologists can provide input into how todefine and describe the important types ofweather exposure, for example, the severity andfrequency of extreme weather events. Adversehealth outcomes associated with interannualclimate variability, such as El Ni\u00f1o events, alsocan be considered (Kovats et al. 2003c). Whenpossible, it is useful for decision makers to cal-culate the proportion of a disease burden thatis attributable to weather and/or climate, suchas what proportion of all cardiovascular deathsare attributable to high or low temperature orthe number of deaths caused by floods.If resources are available and data are ofsufficient quality and quantity, then new epi-demiologic analyses may be undertaken, takinginto account modifying and/or interacting fac-tors. For example, morbidity and mortalityincrease during periods with both extreme heatand high levels of air pollutants (O\u2019Neill et al.2003).Identify and describe current strategies,policies, and measures designed to reduce theburden of climate-sensitive health determinantsand outcomes. The key questions to address fora specific health outcome include the following:a) What is being done now to reduce the bur-den of disease? How effective are these policiesand measures? b) What can be done now toreduce current vulnerability? What are the mainbarriers to implementation (e.g., technology orpolitical will)? c) What options should begin tobe implemented to increase the range of possi-ble future interventions?For each health outcome, the activitiesand measures that institutions, communities,and individuals currently undertake to reducethe burden of disease can be identified froma) review of the literature; b) informationavailable from international and regionalagencies (WHO, the Pan American HealthOrganization, United Nations EnvironmentAssessing vulnerability to climate changeEnvironmental Health Perspectives \u2022 VOLUME 114 | NUMBER 12 | December 2006 1931Table 1.

(2003b).Programme, and others) and national healthand social welfare authorities (ministries ofhealth); and c) consultations with other agen-cies and experts that deal with the impacts ofthe health outcome of concern (e.g., the agen-cies that deal with the weather disasters). Forexample, is an early warning system for heatevents in place? If so, what activities are insti-tuted during a heat event to reduce morbidityand mortality?Ideally, the effectiveness of adaptation mea-sures should be evaluated. An evaluationshould consider approaches to monitor howthe performance of a measure may change overtime compared with the baseline. For example,if an early warning system for heat events is inplace, evaluation can determine whether mor-tality during an event is lower with the system(Ebi et al. 2004).Information generated from this assessmentof the adaptation baseline can identify policiesand measures that could be implemented nowto reduce vulnerability and increase futureadaptive capacity. Consideration needs to begiven to who will implement new measures andthe possible barriers that may be encountered.Review the health implications of thepotential impacts of climate variability andchange on other sectors. Assessments should beintegrated across relevant sectors, especiallywater resources, agriculture, flood hazard man-agement, and the built environment. Theresults of other assessments should be includedto better understand issues such as the healthimplications of the direct impacts of climatechange on the food supply and the risk of dis-asters (e.g., coastal or river flooding). In addi-tion the impacts of implemented adaptationoptions in response to actual or projected cli-mate change need to be evaluated in terms ofpotential adverse health effects. For example,recommending domestic water storage mayhave implications for vector breeding and thetransmission of dengue. Because of the manypossible interactions and types of feedbackamong sectors, development and other projectsshould be subject to environmental and healthimpact assessments.Estimate the future potential healthimpacts. Assessing future health impactsrequires using climate and socioeconomic sce-narios. The scenarios used can be assumptionsabout a certain amount of increase in globalmean surface temperature (i.e., 1 or 2\u00b0C) or canbe detailed quantitative scenarios. If available,national or regional downscaled climate scenar-ios should be used (Arnell et al. 2004; Hulmeet al. 2002; Willows and Connell 2003).Similarly, the appropriate national- or local-level projections of population growth andaging should be used. Addressing potentialimpacts both in the near term (the next20 years) and the long term (up to 2050 or2080) is advisable because a near-term focusprovides relevant information within the usualplanning horizon of health agencies, and anestimate of impacts in the longer term is neededto develop a comprehensive adaptation strategy.Estimation of the potential future healthimpacts of climate variability and changeimplies using an approach in which models ofclimate change (and other changes) drive cli-mate\u2013health associations (Campbell-Lendrumet al. 2006). Health models may be complexspatial models or based on a simple relation-ship between exposure and response. The useof climate scenario data has been addressedin detail elsewhere (Hulme et al. 2002;Nakicenovic and Swart 2000). Projectionsmay be incorporated from models developedfor other sectors, such as flood risk, food sup-ply, and land-use changes.Policy makers must understand the multi-ple sources of uncertainty in estimationsof potential future impacts, from climateprojections to the climate/health models.Uncertainties begin with the climate modelsthemselves, due to such factors as the complex-ity of climate systems, the possibility of nonlin-ear responses to changing greenhouse gasconcentrations, variations in assumptions/model input, and lack of resolution at theregional and national levels. In addition thereare multiple sources of uncertainty in climate/health models, including a lack of understand-ing of the key determinants of the geographicrange and intensity of climate-sensitive healthdeterminants and outcomes (e.g., the role ofland-use change in the spread of vectorbornediseases), incomplete data on these relation-ships, a lack of understanding of how to math-ematically model the relationships to makeprojections of future burdens of disease,and how societies and burdens of diseasewill change over the next 25\u2013100 years(McMichael et al. 2001). Explicitly estimatinguncertainty can further understanding of thelevel of confidence in what is known and canprovide input into future research directionsand policy making (Moss and Schneider2000). Policy makers should be realistic aboutthe likelihood that the uncertainty can beresolved in a meaningful time frame.Synthesize the results. The quantitative andqualitative information collected in the previ-ous steps is synthesized to identify changes inrisk patterns and to identify links amongsectors, vulnerable groups, and stakeholderresponses. It is important that the synthesisfocus both on long-term projections to identifyemerging trends and on the shorter timeframes used in decisionmaking. Examples ofassessments that synthesized qualitative andquantitative data are presented in Casimiroet al. (2006) and Furgal and Sequin (2006).The key issues that need to be communicatedto decision makers and stakeholders includethe specific projected health impacts, thecurrent and projected burden of those impacts,the effectiveness of current interventions tocontrol the health impact, the rate at whichnegative impacts could be detected, and thedegree of certainty associated with the projec-tions. Qualitative results can be summarized as,for example, a particular health outcomeincreasing from a low to medium level of con-cern over the next few decades with a highdegree of certainty, depending on the effective-ness of interventions implemented to reducedthe disease burden. Convening an interdiscipli-nary panel of experts with relevant expertise isone approach to developing a consensus assess-ment. Once synthesized, the informationshould be peer reviewed and published.Assumptions that underlie any quantita-tive estimates should be clearly described.Quantitative estimates should be clearly identi-fied with its climate scenario. The degree of cer-tainty of qualitative and quantitative statementsshould be provided, and the most vulnerablepopulation groups should be identified.Value judgments have to be made insummarizing the assessment. In particular,decisions should be made about how to bal-ance near-term and long-term effects; weighthe potential effects in different populationgroups; balance the more certain, quantifiablepotential effects with those that are less certainand not quantifiable; and balance the interestsof the various stakeholder groups (Lehto andRitsatakis, unpublished data).Identify additional adaptation policies andmeasures, including procedures for evaluationafter implementation. This step identifies pos-sible adaptation measures that could be under-taken over the short term to increase thecapacity of individuals, communities, andcountries to effectively cope with the weatheror climate exposure of concern. A review ofadaptation measures implemented in otherregions with similar health concerns may beone source of new adaptations. These measuresshould be possible to implement within thepopulation\u2019s access to material resources, tech-nology, and human and social capital. Forexample, if heat-related morbidity and mortal-ity are health issues in an urban area and if anearly warning system for heat waves has notbeen implemented, then would implementingsuch a system likely benefit population health?Strengths and weaknesses as well as opportuni-ties and threats to implementation should beevaluated and priorities set.In addition, countries need to adapt tolong-term climate change. The second aim ofthis step is to identify possible measures thatcan be taken today and in the future toincrease the ability of individuals, communi-ties, and institutions to effectively cope withfuture weather, including extreme weatherevents. Consideration should be given tothe lessons learned from past public healthEbi et al.1932 VOLUME 114 | NUMBER 12 | December 2006 \u2022 Environmental Health Perspectivespolicies, including the effectiveness of variousmeasures, such as vector control and earlywarning systems.Many of the possible measures for adaptingto climate change lie primarily outside thedirect control of the health sector. They arerooted in areas such as sanitation and watersupply, education, agriculture, trade, tourism,transport, development, and housing. Inter-sectoral and cross-sectoral adaptation strategiesare needed to reduce the potential healthimpacts of climate change. A policy analysiswill determine the feasibility of and prioritiesamong these options. Generally, many of thepolicies and measures identified also promotesustainable development.Criteria should be established in advancefor evaluating possible adaptation measures.Evaluation should be an ongoing process bothto identify opportunities for improving theeffectiveness of the measures but also to iden-tify maladaptation and unintended conse-quences as quickly as possible (Yohe and Ebi2005). The traditional public health methodsfor evaluating the efficacy and effectiveness of aparticular intervention should be applied, withappropriate consideration of the local circum-stances. For example, the effectiveness of heatevent early warning systems can be evaluatedby determining whether mortality during heatevents decreases after system implementation.This, of course, requires that evaluation criteriabe built into the system when it is developed.Framework for the AssessmentFor an assessment to be informative, timely,and useful, key issues need to be addressed,particularly stakeholder involvement, anadequate management structure, and acommunication strategy.Experiences from countries that have per-formed assessments have shown the impor-tance of including stakeholders in assessmentplanning, implementation, and evaluation.Stakeholders include people within govern-ments, nongovernmental organizations,research institutions, and private entities thatfocus on public health. The issues and ques-tions of greatest concern to the stakeholdersmust be elicited to ensure that the assessmentprovides useful information. This does notimply that relevant issues, otherwise not identi-fied or known as important to stakeholders,would be left out of the assessment. Assessorsstrive to answer stakeholder questions to theextent possible given uncertain science; theyalso characterize the uncertainty and explorethe implication for various policy or resourcemanagement decisions. Once an assessment iscompleted and the stakeholders are informedof the results, assessors should elicit from thestakeholders any new interests and concernsthe assessment raises. Openness and inclusive-ness enable participants to bring a diversity ofviews and information that may benefit theassessment process and make the process moretransparent and credible.An adequate communication strategy isneeded before, during, and after the assess-ment. Effective risk communications is a two-way process including exchanges amonginterested parties (individuals, social groups,industry, and governments) (NationalResearch Council 1989). Risk communica-tion is, by definition, proactive and mayinvolve many stakeholders and audiences, var-ious levels of communication, and phases orstages of communication to accommodate theneeds inherent in each step of the assessment.The potential for achieving successful riskcommunication increases with knowledge ofthe audience\u2014what their concerns are, howthey perceive risk, and whom they trust.Identifying this information early and incor-porating it into the initial stages can bringbenefits later in the process.Many of the aspects of the assessmentprocess, such as engaging stakeholders, syn-thesizing results, and developing policy, willhave implications after the assessment is com-pleted. Research gaps and information needsidentified during the assessment will establishdirections for future development. Selectingand implementing policy options feed intofurther monitoring and surveillance work tocreate an iterative cycle of assessment and pol-icy development (Scheraga et al. 2003). Forexample, research gaps that are identifiedshould guide the priority setting of research tofill these gaps, and new research findings canadvance future assessments.Risk ManagementApplying appropriate risk management princi-ples, tools, and measures can reduce currentand future human health vulnerability to cli-mate variability and change. Numerous riskmanagement frameworks have been developedthat can be modified to address national,regional, and local assessment needs (e.g.,Willows and Connell 2003). The first step inthese frameworks typically involves evaluationof whether a specific exposure is a risk tohuman health and well-being. Once a type ofexposure is determined to be a risk (e.g., heavyrain causing rivers to overflow), the conse-quences of exposure for the affected popula-tion are assessed, including the magnitude andfrequency of the risk, the likelihood of expo-sure, who is or will be at increased risk ofadverse health effects by level of exposure, andwhat is or will be at risk that could adverselyaffect health, such as damage to built infra-structure and/or interference with health andsocial services.Risk identification is followed by an assess-ment of the strengths and weaknesses of thehuman and material resources available toreduce (or manage) the risks. This mightinclude assessing the ability of public healthunits, fire departments, emergency services, andeven military units to provide emergency ser-vices during weather-related disasters. Therealso should be an assessment of the ability tocope with risks that increase gradually, such asprogressive droughts shrinking water suppliesand increasing crop failures. Policy makers andthe public need to know whether public healthservices and other health and social infrastruc-ture might be weakened by a deterioratingeconomy and by shrinking government incomeand resources.Next, information is needed on the aware-ness and tolerance of risk at the local, regional,and national levels. Information should begathered on the risks that stakeholders perceiveto be the most important and why. Prioritiesneed to be established for how, by whom, howquickly, to what extent, and in which order therisks should and could be reduced.The adaptation assessment will have identi-fied a range of possible options that could beimplemented to address the risks of concern.These interventions have varying degrees ofeffectiveness, ease of implementation, expecteddisadvantages, and costs. Decision makers andpolicy makers combine this information withfactors such as current policy priorities andsocial values to determine a strategic direction.Stakeholders should be made aware of thehuman and financial resource trade-offsrequired for the recommended adaptationoptions, and the uncertainties associated withboth the climate change\u2013related health impactsand the effectiveness of the proposed approachesto mitigate those impacts.Finally, mechanisms for monitoring andevaluation need to be established to determinewhether the measures implemented have thedesired effect and whether midcourse correc-tions are needed. Corrections may arisebecause of changes in social, economic, envi-ronmental, and technologic conditions overtime. Significant changes may require initiatinga new cycle of assessment and risk manage-ment to take these changes into account.DiscussionAddressing climate change\u2013related healthimpacts has become more urgent with therealization that impacts are already occurring(Patz et al. 2005). Considerably more infor-mation is needed on the pathways by whichweather can affect health, on the subgroupsmost vulnerable to climate-sensitive healthdeterminants and outcomes, and on the impli-cations of climate change for public healthpolicy and practice. Continuing currentapproaches to risks posed by weather and cli-mate runs the risk that potentially effectiveadaptation options may be unidentified,unimplemented, or implemented too late,Assessing vulnerability to climate changeEnvironmental Health Perspectives \u2022 VOLUME 114 | NUMBER 12 | December 2006 1933Ebi et al.1934 VOLUME 114 | NUMBER 12 | December 2006 \u2022 Environmental Health Perspectivesresulting in preventable illnesses and deathsand increased costs.Adaptation options to address climatechange\u2013related health impacts will aim to becost-effective in terms of lives saved and illnessavoided. The focus should be on win\u2013winstrategies to improve public health regardlessof the changes in weather and climate. Addingadaptation measures into existing programsmay not be costly. For example, integratedvector management programs could adjustsome monitoring sites to determine if a vectoror the disease it carries is expanding or con-tracting its range. In addition there are oppor-tunities to adapt to multiple factors. Forexample, the existence of federal flood insur-ance in the United States provides an incen-tive for development in high-risk coastal areas(as strongly evidenced in the 2005 hurricaneseason), which increases the risk of injury anddeath to coastal populations (Scheraga et al.2003). Elimination of federal flood insurancetoday would reduce the size of the coastalcommunities currently at risk (at a financialcost to individuals living in coastal communi-ties) and at future risk due to rising sea levels.The decision of whether to adapt now or latershould be based on a comparison of the pre-sent value of expected net benefits associatedwith acting sooner or later (Scheraga et al.2003).Initial national assessments and communi-cations made clear that a major constraint toconducting a vulnerability and adaptationassessment is the lack of high-quality long-termdata sets, particularly in most low-incomecountries and many economies in transition, tounderstand current relationships betweenweather and climate and health determinantsand outcomes. However, ministries of health,nongovernmental organizations, other organi-zations, and researchers can qualitatively esti-mate current health burdens and how theseburdens could change under different scenariosof changing temperature and precipitation.Another constraint in conducting assessments isthe lack of experience with doing so, which iswhy the secretariat for the UNFCCC, theUnited Nations Development Programme, andother organizations are providing training onmethods and tools to build national capacity forevaluating vulnerability to climate variabilityand change and for mainstreaming adaptationdecisions into ongoing processes, such assustainable development plans.Assessments of the potential health impactsof climate variability and change are needed toinform the development of adaptation optionsin health and other sectors and to provideinformation on the impacts and the adaptationrequirements to international policy processes.The assessment must make the problem andthe potential impacts explicit and clear to pol-icy makers and should help decision makers inchoosing among adaptation options designedto reduce negative impacts.REFERENCESAlbritton DL, Meiro Filho LG. 2001.

Since I took office as Secretary of Vermont\u2019s Agency of Natural Resources only three years ago Vermont has experienced eight federally declared extreme weather disasters.  These disasters included Tropical Storm Irene in 2011, which impacted nearly every town in Vermont, destroying 500 miles of roads and damaging 200 bridges; cutting off entire communities for days.  We also saw historic snowstorms, historic flooding of Lake Champlain, widespread damage from the rainiest May on record and a number of more localized extreme weather events.  The economic and human costs of these storms are staggering. We cannot wait for the next Irene, or the next historic blizzard, heat wave, drought or wildfire. We must address the causes of climate change and prepare for its inevitable impacts. We need to plan, and we need to act.  But to do that, we need good information. The Vermont Climate Assessment produced by the Gund Institute for Ecological Economics and the University of Vermont is an important tool for scientists, practitioners and policy makers. It is the first comprehensive report, using data collected from across the state, of the changes in Vermont\u2019s climate and the impact of those changes on our lives and livelihoods.  The climate assessment underscores that uncertainty remains about the future extent of many of the impacts examined in the report, such as the impacts of earlier winter thaw dates on the hydrologic cycle, and the extent to which climate change will affect the frequency, severity or magnitude of ecological disturbance in Vermont\u2019s forests.  However, little doubt exists that we will experience change. Just by presenting this scientific information, the assessment makes a powerful and persuasive case for decision makers that we have no choice but to act; both to reduce emissions, and to build our resilience in light of the many uncertainties we face.  Addressing climate change is not easy because of the complexity of the issues, and because of the lack of certainty about the speed and nature of the changes we will face. It is a challenge for decision-makers to plan for the impacts of climate change even as we seek to integrate climate resilience into our built and natural systems. Vermont has an opportunity to lead this effort. Living in small communities, close to the land, we know first-hand that everything is interconnected; vibrant communities, healthy people, well-balanced ecosystems and a strong economy go hand-in-hand. We see that when ecological systems become unbalanced there is a corresponding detrimental impact on our lives and our  7 pocketbooks. We need look no further than our backyard for evidence that this is so: in places where pollution from storm water runoff has made the waters in Lake Champlain un-swimmable, businesses that rely on visitors to the lake are suffering. Where air quality is poor, increasing numbers of children are experiencing asthma attacks that cause unnecessary suffering and economic hardship as parents miss work and pay thousands of dollars in medical expenses. Where wetlands have been compromised or destroyed, flood damage becomes more severe, impacting lives and seriously impairing already strained budgets. Many of these ecological imbalances are exacerbated by climate change.  It is my hope that the Vermont Climate Assessment is the start of an inclusive, broad based, and sustained process for assessing and communicating scientific knowledge of the impacts, risks, and vulnerabilities associated with a changing climate, to support decision-making in Vermont.  By compiling the best scientific information about the current impact of global climate change on Vermont and its likely future impact, we can begin to envision what Vermont would look like as a collection of resilient communities set in a resilient landscape. In each of our cities, towns and villages we can begin to identify our strengths and vulnerabilities and think creatively about the investments we could make today that will help us survive, and even thrive, in the face of unexpected challenges. With good information we can rethink how we build (or rebuild) our transportation infrastructure; how we get and deliver our energy; where and how we grow our communities and preserve or restore ecosystems; and how we create greater economic opportunities for ourselves and for our neighbors. The work we are doing to create resilient communities is vitally important. These are changing and challenging times; but one thing we have learned as Vermonters is that with good information we can come together to make a real and positive difference for ourselves and for future generations.    Deb Markowitz, Secretary      8 Executive Summary  The Vermont Climate Assessment (VCA) paints a vivid picture of a changing climate in Vermont and calls for immediate strategic planning to sustain the social, economic and environmental fabric of our state. The VCA is the first state-scale climate assessment in the country and speaks directly to the impacts of climate change as they pertain to our rural towns, cities and communities, including impacts on Vermont tourism and recreation, agriculture, natural resources and energy.  A Call for Action in Vermont  Climate change is no longer a thing of the future; it is affecting Vermont today. Extreme weather events, such as heavy downpours, have become more frequent and/or intense. Across the state, there have already been significant changes in the length of the frost-free growing season and in the warmth of nighttime temperatures. These, and other changes, are part of the pattern of global climate change, primarily driven by human activity. Vermont is a small contributor to global climate change yet must face the local consequences of climate change by building local capacity and resilience.   Many of the impacts associated with climate change affect livelihoods and ecosystems in Vermont. These impacts are the subject of this report and are significant for all communities, especially those with economic or infrastructure challenges, and for species and habitats facing other external pressures. Some impacts of climate change in Vermont are positive, but the negative impacts remain of serious concern for their economic, social and environmental consequences. Of particular significance are adverse effects to agricultural production, including dairy, fruit and maple syrup, more frequent flooding and heavy downpours, and negative influences on winter recreation industries due to reductions in snow cover. To date, Vermont has begun to pursue public policy that builds resilience within its 256 towns\u2014the success of which is dependent upon sustained action as the memory of Tropical Storm Irene (2011), which caused serious damage in the state, begins to fade. The VCA presents information to aid in preparation for these changes in Vermont\u2019s climate (Box 1), highlighting opportunities that provide economic benefits and minimize costs over time, while noting the potential outcomes of inaction.   The VCA addresses three main goals: 1) further scientific understanding of global change trends using local, historical data; 2) develop a deeper understanding of future impacts of climate change, and 3) communicate the current state of knowledge on global change impacts in Vermont, focusing on agricultural production, forests, water resources and recreation industries. Additionally, the VCA serves to cultivate partnerships with stakeholders while investigating priority topics for research by performing a needs assessment to understand what information is most needed for adaptation and mitigation strategies to deliver Vermont towards a more resilient future.  Box 1. Climate vs. Weather  9  Weather expresses the day-to-day atmospheric conditions, i.e., \u201cwhat is the weather like at a specific place and point in time?\u201d For example, weather describes more short-term time frames such as rain, snow, sunshine, blizzards, flooding, ice storms, and so on.  Climate expresses patterns of weather over a longer time horizon, i.e., \u201cwhat are the atmospheric conditions over a period of months, years or decades?\u201d For example, climate describes the average long-term conditions of snowfall, rainfall, temperature, cloud cover, and so on.  \u201cClimate is what you expect, weather is what you get\u201d    Methods: Making the Vermont Climate Assessment   Lead authors: Dr. Gillian Galford (Research Assistant Professor, Gund Institute for Ecological Economics and the Rubenstein School for Environment and Natural Resources [RSENR], University of Vermont [UVM]), Sam Carlson (M.Sc. and Ecological Economics Certificate student, RSENR, UVM), Sarah Ford (M.Sc. student, Forest Science, RSENR, UVM), Ann Hoogenboom (SunCommon, MPA \u201914 and Ecological Economics certificate, Community Development & Applied Economics, Collage of Agricultural and Life Sciences, UVM), Julie Nash (Ph.D. and Ecological Economics certificate candidate, RSENR, UVM), Elizabeth Palchak (Ph.D. and Ecological Economics certificate student, RSENR, UVM), Sarah Pears (Ph.D. and Ecological Economics certificate student, RSENR, UVM), and Kristen Underwood (Ph.D. student, Civil and Environmental Engineering, College of Engineering and Mathematical Sciences, UVM) and Daniel Baker (B.S. candidate, Environmental Studies, UVM). Bryne Hadnott (Research Specialist, UVM) contributed to analysis of Vermont\u2019s climate data. Dr. Alan Betts (Atmospheric Research) contributed to climate data analysis and writing of the full report. Each chapter had one or two graduate students as a lead writer. The leads collected and analyzed data from literature, interviews and observational data. All lead authors consulted, co-authored, or were reviewed with/by external experts in the subject matter. Additional authors are noted for the individual chapters.  The VCA is divided into chapters based on the sectors most important to Vermont in the face of global climate change. Each chapter concludes with confidence ratings around the impacts of climate change in Vermont for their respective key messages.  \u201cVery high\u201d confidence rankings have strong evidence (established theory, multiple sources, consistent results, well-document methods, etc.) and high consensus. \u201cHigh\u201d confidence findings have moderate evidence (several sources, some consistency, methods vary and/or documentation is limited, etc.) and medium consensus. \u201cMedium\u201d confidence findings have suggestive evidence (a few sources, limited consistency, models incomplete, methods emerging, etc.) and competing schools of thought. \u201cLow\u201d confidence findings have inconclusive evidence (limited sources, extrapolations, inconsistent findings, poor documentation and/or methods that are not tested) and a disagreement or lack of opinions among experts. The majority of findings in the VCA have a very high to high confidence level. The confidence ranking tables for each chapter\u2019s key messages  10 provides 1) documentation of the process the authors used to come to the conclusions in their key messages; 2) additional information to reviewers about the quality of the information used; and 3) allows traceability to data and resources.). Direct references to the data and literature source of the findings can be found in these tables as well as throughout the text. Historical climate data was supplied by NOAA/National Weather Service with assistance from the Burlington office and Andy Nash, Meterologist-in-Charge (NOAA/NWS). Projections of future climate change are supplied by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and refer to model ensembles from the Couple Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) and represent low to high global emission scenarios and representative concentration pathways (Christensen et al. 2013).  National Coordination on Climate Change  The VCA is partnered with the National Climate Assessment (NCA) to engage producers and users of assessment information across the United States. The VCA is the first state-level climate assessment modeled after the NCA. The NCA is mandated by the US Global Change Research Act of 1990 and now serves as a broad communication tool on climate change and its impacts around the United States. The third National Climate Assessment (NCA) was officially released on May 6, 2014 (Melillo et al. 2014). The VCA mirrors the NCA structure but is tailored toward the sectors most applicable to Vermont environmentally, socially and economically.    While the NCA contains a wealth of information, it provides only high-level summaries. The Northeast regional report does not address the breadth and depth of impacts on economic, social and environmental impacts specific to Vermont. To date, Vermont has had no comprehensive assessment of economic impacts of historical climate variability or analysis of regions or sectors that may be challenged under future climate change scenarios. In fact, no single state in the US has completed a state-level climate assessment providing data similar to the NCA until the VCA.    Climate Change in Vermont: Historical Trends  Rising Temperatures: The evidence of changing climate is clear for Vermont. The state\u2019s average temperature has increased by 1.3\u00b0F since 1960; 45% of this increase has occurred since 1990. The most recent decade was Vermont\u2019s hottest on record. All regions within Vermont are experiencing warming, although the changes in temperature are not uniform. Vermont is likely to see larger temperature increases in winter than in summer.  Increasing Precipitation: In general, precipitation has and will continue to increase, particularly in winter months. Through observations taken since the 1940\u2019s, we see that rainfall has increased across Vermont with the greatest increases occurring in the mountainous regions. Average annual precipitation across the state has increased by 5.9 inches since 1960; 48% of this increase has occurred since 1990. Rainfall records show that heavy rainfall events are becoming more common and pose threats of flooding. In August, 2011, heavy rainfall saturated the ground and,  11 as a result, flooding was widespread when additional rains fell with the arrival of Tropical Storm Irene.   Freeze-Thaw Cycles: Warmer seasonal temperatures are resulting in later \u201cfirst-fall freeze\u201d and earlier \u201clast-spring freeze\u201d. The result is a change in growing season days, with freeze period decreasing by 3.9 days per decade and growing season increasing by 3.7 days per decade over the past forty years. This also effects the freeze up and thaw out dates of small lakes and ponds.   Flooding: Impacts of flooding on water quality continues to be a concern in agricultural areas where the historical legacy of fertilizer use decades ago is resulting in high levels of nutrient run-off into rivers and lakes. Large pulses of nutrients are stripped from soils and transported through waterways during large precipitation events. Records across Vermont show that flashy flows are increasingly common in our rivers. These large pulses of water in small river valleys may threaten development located in floodplains. Particularly vulnerable to the effects of floods are mobile home parks, and their low-income residents, that are often located in floodplains and can be catastrophically destroyed by just one to two feet of flood water.   Box 2. Projected vs. Predicted  Projected vs. Predicted: We use the term \u2018projected\u2019 rather than \u2018predicted\u2019, as predict implies a certainty that we do not have for future climate conditions. Projections for future conditions carry levels of uncertainty. Located at the end of each chapter are confidence tables that express the likelihood of our key findings on a scale from low to very high.  Forecasts are based on assumptions that reflect the conditions that are expected to exist. For example, a weather forecast is produced by applying existing knowledge to project the state of the atmosphere for a given location. Climate Change in Vermont: Projected Trends  Warming Temperatures: Temperatures will continue to rise, with the next few decades projected (Box 2) to see another 3\u00b0 F by 2050 and 5\u00b0 F (1.7\u00b0 and 2.8\u00b0 C, respectively) of warming by late century in most areas at the low emissions scenario. According to the IPCC, the amount of warming by the end of this century is projected to be roughly 2\u00b0 F to 5.2\u00b0 F (1.1\u00b0 C to 2.9\u00b0 C) under a lower emissions scenario involving substantial reductions in emissions after 2050 (\u201cB1 scenario\u201d) or 3.6\u00b0 F to 9.7\u00b0 F (2.0\u00b0 to 5.4\u00b0 C) for a higher emissions scenario assuming continued increases in emissions (\u201cA2 scenario\u201d) (Christensen et al. 2013) . Across the state, historical weather data show that temperatures have been warming twice as fast in winter than in summer. As a result of warmer winters, time that Vermont\u2019s rivers and lakes are frozen each winter is decreasing by 7 days per decade. Spring has started 2 to 3 days earlier per decade which has increased the growing season by 3.7 days per decade. Due to warmer temperatures and longer growing seasons, Vermont has already transitioned from hardiness zone 4 to zone 5 from 1990 to 2006.  12  Increasing Precipitation: Precipitation will continue to increase over the next Century in Vermont, with the largest increases occurring in mountainous regions. In the near-term of the next 25 years, much of this precipitation will fall as snow. As temperatures continue to increase, winter precipitation will shift to rainfall in the next 50 years and beyond.   Weather Extremes: The chances of record-breaking high temperature extremes will continue to increase as the climate continues to change. High nighttime temperatures are increasingly common and have widespread impacts on humans, recreation and energy demand. In winter months, warmer nighttime temperatures threaten snow and ice cover for winter recreation. In summer months, this causes increased demand for cooling. An increase in high-energy electric (lighting) storms is projected to continue particularly threatening infrastructure and transportation systems.  The Jet Stream: Vermont\u2019s location allows the jet stream, which varies season by season, to deliver much of its short-term weather systems. Recent \u201cblocking\u201d or quasi-stationary patterns in the jet stream have led to prolonged periods of intense rainfall (e.g., June 2013) or dryspells (e.g., August 2012). Scientists believe reductions in ice cover in the Arctic have changed global temperature gradients, which increases the likelihood of blocking patterns and unseasonably high or low temperatures and/or precipitation.   Economic Impacts of Climate Change in Vermont  Policy: Vermont can play a role in demonstrating systemic change for decreasing greenhouse gas emissions. The Vermont State Government has been taking action towards emissions reduction programs since the beginning of the century. A constituent base that values climate change action across the state generally supports current legislation to advance the state goals of a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2028 and 90% of energy obtained from renewable sources by 2050.  Community Development: As average annual rainfall has increased in recent decades, average annual flows in Vermont rivers have increased. Rural and urban communities around Vermont are at risk of these impacts. Many communities have already been highly impacted and are engaged in processes to respond to climate change related transitions through formal planning. Community\u2019s infrastructure systems are highly vulnerable to climate change. This vulnerability is exacerbated by the state\u2019s mountainous, rural geography and small rural communities with limitations existing in transportation routes and communication systems.  Energy: The temperature rise in summer and the increased use of air conditioning will outweigh the reduction in energy demand for heating in the winter. Increased risk of major storm events in Vermont will threaten energy infrastructure. In June and July of 2013 alone, 70,000 separate energy outages occurred in Vermont. In Vermont, forecasts to 2030 anticipate peak energy load increasing 0.7% annually due to increased demand for air conditioning. Adaptation through the use of renewable, local energy sources will be critically important as extreme weather events  13 increase and threaten fossil fuel-based energy supplies. Energy efficiency and conservation are key components of Vermont\u2019s goal of obtaining 90% renewable energy sources by 2050. Energy policy attempts to leverage behavior change to accomplish energy efficiency goals.  Water resources: Warmer temperatures are leading to earlier thaw dates on Vermont\u2019s rivers, lakes and ponds and snowpack in the mountains. Average annual stream flows are shifting and, overall, are expected to continue increasing in coming decades. High flows are already occurring more frequently. Under assumptions of high green-house-gas emissions scenarios, up to an 80% increase in the probability of high stream flows is projected by end of the century. Climate models project more frequent high flow events (and flooding), particularly in the winter months as a greater fraction of winter precipitation will fall as rain or freezing rain rather than snow. While Vermont rivers have sustained higher levels of base flow over recent decades in summer months in contrast to other New England states, climate projections show increased potential for short-term dry spells. Too much and too little water pose threats to agriculture, forests, infrastructure, health, and homes.    Forests: Increased temperatures will lengthen growing seasons and increase suitable range for certain Vermont tree species like oak, hickory, and red maple, but decrease suitable range for cold-tolerant species like spruce and fir. Changes in precipitation cycles (wetter winters and extended dry spells in summers) will place more stress on important tree species such as sugar maple and red spruce, which have already experienced periods of decline in Vermont. Certain models project that by the end of the century, the northeast could be dominated by an oak-hickory forest, with spruce-fir forests being virtually non-existent and maple-beech-birch forests being driven north to Maine. Warmer temperatures will result in earlier bud burst and flowering periods for certain species, making them more susceptible to pests and pathogens. Warming temperatures may threaten plant and animal species in our forests by changing growing conditions that are unfavorable or that encourage invasive species. Forests currently offset almost all of Vermont\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions so their shifts or losses will feedback to climate change as well as having economic impacts on recreation and tourism, forestry, and maple industries. Agriculture: Increasingly variable levels of summer precipitation and/or extreme temperatures may heighten challenges in the agricultural sector. Warmer seasonal temperatures will result in later \u201cfirst-fall freeze\u201d and earlier \u201clast-spring freeze\u201d. This extended growing season can increase overall crop productivity and create new crop opportunities. The potential negative effects include increased stress from weed growth, disease outbreaks and pest infestations. Higher CO2 in the atmosphere promotes photosynthesis and can potentially fuel the growth of many Vermont plant varietals. For Vermont livestock operations, summer heat stress could lead to slight decreases in livestock productivity. More pronounced climate change impacts come from pasture productivity and other production inputs such as feed costs and energy costs. Variations in seasonal precipitation combined with the increased frequency of high-energy storms could lead to extreme year-to-year weather variations with implications on farm business viability.   14 Recreation and Tourism: In the short term, increasing precipitation will increase snowfall and preserve Vermont\u2019s winter recreation industry. In the long term, as snow cover recedes, there are opportunities for increasing summer tourism earnings that could compensate for winter losses as snowfall turns to rain later this century. Within 30-40 years, average winter temperatures are expected to increase to the point that most winter precipitation will fall as rain, which will result in shorter-lasting snowpack and snowfall, reducing the winter tourism and recreation seasons.  However, over the next 25 years, snowfall in mountainous areas may increase with increasing winter precipitation (a climate change \u201csweet spot\u201d), which would have a positive impact on winter-related recreation and tourism industries. The summer tourism and recreation seasons will lengthen, and increased temperatures combined with higher humidity further south are expected to drive more tourists to Vermont.  Increased temperatures will encourage expansion of pest species, reducing the quality of the recreation experience and requiring increased monitoring and treatment.  Fall recreational opportunities and tourism will lengthen with the warmer temperatures, creating expanded economic opportunities. Public Health: Climate change may intensify existing health threats, and new health threats will emerge. Potential public health threats include: heat-related illnesses, intensified air pollution, injury associated with flooding events, increase in freshwater-borne disease, and viral diseases carried by ticks and mosquitos. The elderly, children, the poor, and the sick may be more vulnerable to the range of climate change-related health impacts. Pollen counts are increasing with increased temperatures and precipitation, which will increase the burden of allergens and asthma. Location of residence including those in floodplains and narrow mountain valleys increase risk and vulnerability. Just as some choices can make us more vulnerable, other choices can make us more resilient. Maintaining a robust public health infrastructure will be critical to managing the potential health impacts of climate change. Transportation and Housing: Climate change and other human modifications of ecosystems and landscapes often increase vulnerability to damage from extreme events and reduce natural capacity to modulate the impacts of such events. Floodplain wetlands in Vermont absorb floodwaters and reduce the effects of high flows on river-margin lands. Maintaining intact floodplains will mitigate the chance of disastrous flooding in our communities. High energy storms can bring tornados or cause large windthrows that damage our transportation infrastructure.  Education: The use of education and outreach is needed to help Vermonters avoid negative and costly climate change impacts through changes in our behavior (e.g., energy usage, infrastructure investments, consumer behavior, etc.).  Over the past 15 years the Vermont State Government, and in particular the current Governor\u2019s Office, has taken a lead role in promoting education and outreach with respect to climate change.  Vermont\u2019s institutions of higher education are also very active in conducting research and disseminating knowledge to both the scientific community and the public at large.  The study of climate change is only partially, but increasingly,  15 incorporated into K-12 education.  Student knowledge of earth science lags behind that of biological and physical science. Combining climate change educational activities with appeals to Vermonters\u2019 values, changes in material incentives through policy reforms, and strengthened social norms could induce more pro-environmental behavior and improve economic outcomes in light of climate change. Cross-Cutting Themes  Turning Vulnerability to Resiliency: Taking action through Adaptation and Mitigation This report defines resiliency as the capability of social and or natural systems to respond to and recover from climate change events (Box 3). Adaptation is the process of adjustments that social ecological systems make in response to changing situations to reduce vulnerability from climate change impacts. Meanwhile, mitigation refers to a proactive process that moderates climate change disruption through reducing our overall contribution to emissions. These terms and their definitions appear in every chapter. The key messages in all chapters are chiefly summarizations of the vulnerability of a given sector, agriculture for instance, to projected climate impacts. Adaptation is often assessed and summarized as well. For example, in the case of the agriculture sector, there are serious vulnerabilities regarding changing growing seasons, but altering specific farm practices or timing of certain operations are adaptation strategies to address this vulnerability. These actions contribute to the resiliency of a farm. Adaptation presents new opportunities by taking advantage of specific changes in climate, such as growing new crop varieties due to a longer growing season. Mitigation and adaptation are linked, in that effective mitigation reduces the need for adaptation. Vermont has embraced \u201cresilience\u201d as a way to incorporate adaptation and mitigation in policy, lifestyles, and more. This is an empowering stance on climate change and is an essential part of a comprehensive response strategy.   Box 3. Action in Vermont Adaptation: In Vermont, adaptation activities include town-level planning for flood resilience. Mitigation: Investments in the state\u2019s renewable energy portfolio mitigate our emissions that contribute to the acceleration of climate change impacts. Resilience: Examples of resilience include designing new bridges to allow for meandering of rivers, such that during flood stage the rivers can jump their bank without damage to transportation infrastructure.   Weather and Climate Extremes \u201cExtremes\u201d refers to weather and climate events like hot spells, heavy rains, periods of drought and flooding, and severe storms (Box 4). Impacts expected to have the greatest consequences will be characterized by changes in the frequency, intensity, timing, duration, and spatial extent of extremes particularly arriving as unprecedented events. Most of the scientific literature on extremes uses definitions that fall roughly into two categories (IPCC 2012): those related to the probability of occurrence of a certain type of event, and those related to exceeding a particular threshold.   16  Box 4. Classifying an Extreme  Extremes might be determined by the number, percentage, or fraction of days in a month, season, or year with maximum (or minimum) temperature above the 90th, 95th, or 99th percentile compared to a reference time period, such as the last four decades. Alternatively, how often a threshold temperature, for example 32\u00b0F or 90\u00b0F, is exceeded during a given decade. Extremes are also measured based on the average frequency of a given event that exceeds a specific magnitude. Extremes is a broad term and refers to a variety of events that vary in timescale.  Future Steps  As climate change and its impacts are becoming more prevalent, Vermonters face choices. As a result of past emissions of heat-trapping gases, additional climate change with its related impacts is now unavoidable. This is due to the long-lived nature of many of these gases, the amount of heat absorbed and retained by the oceans, and other responses within the climate system. However, beyond the next few decades, the amount of climate change will still largely be determined by choices society makes about emissions. While Vermont does not have a remotely significant effect on global greenhouse emissions, it is in a position to demonstrate the effectiveness of various systemic changes in reducing overall greenhouse gas emissions. Vermont\u2019s progressive climate policies, particularly regarding energy and transportation, are largely discussed in the climate policy chapter, the energy chapter, and the brief transportation chapter. Both top-down policies and bottom-up management and decision making will ensure our communities thrive as our climate changes. A system that is truly resilient to climate change will be one that embraces and adopts both mitigation and adaptation strategies\u2014this is the future of Vermont. References Christensen, J. H., K.

Vermont\u2019s Changing Climate This chapter summarizes how climate is changing in Vermont, why it is changing and what is projected for the future. While the focus is on changes in Vermont, there is a need to a broader geographical context to understand climate change. This is the first attempt to provide a state-wide assessment of climate change for Vermont \u2014and the first statewide assessment completed in the United States. The key messages are presented below with supporting evidence. The discussion of each key message includes a summary of recent trends and outlook for the future.  1. 2. Background and Global Context: Global climate is changing now, driven by human activities and amplified by water cycle processes, and this change is apparent across a wide range of observations. Global climate is projected to change over the next century, although the exact magnitude of climate change will depend primarily on the amount of global greenhouse gas emissions and the response of the climate to these emissions. Climate is defined as the average weather for a place. Changes in weather over time make for changes in climate (Figure 1.1). A large component of global climate change is caused by the Greenhouse Effect, which is a term that describes the increase of heat-trapping gases that lead to increased temperatures. Human activities have led to an increase in the amount of heat-trapping gases, aerosols (small particles) and water vapor in the atmosphere.  Figure 1.1 Ten indicators of a Warming World (Arndt et al. 2010). These indicators show that Earth\u2019s climate is warming. White arrows indicate increases trends and black arrows indicate decreasing trends. All the indicators expected to increase (decrease) in a warming world are increasing (decreasing).  Figure 1.2. Temperatures changes over the past 20 years (1991-2011) compared to the 1901-1960 average. Bar plots show average temperature changes by decade for 1901-2011 relative to the 1901-1960 average by region (Melillo et al. 2014).   19 Since 1750, the overall effect of human activities on climate has been a warming influence that greatly exceeds known changes in natural processes like solar changes or volcanic eruptions. Global measurements indicate that the earth\u2019s surface has been warmed by 0.55\u00b0 C since the 1970s, with some areas warming more rapidly than others. Likewise, precipitation is changing in amount, intensity, frequency and type of precipitation. Some regions of the world have recorded significantly increased precipitation, including eastern parts of North and South America, northern Europe, and northern and central Asia. Other regions have experienced drying, including the Sahel, southern Africa, the Mediterranean and southern Asia. Globally, the intensity of rainfall events is increasing due to increased water vapor in the atmosphere that evaporates from the oceans as they warm. The polar regions are losing ice rapidly due to warming. Between 1993-2003 it is estimated that melting glaciers, ice caps and ice sheets contributed to sea level rise by 1.2 mm year-1. Another cause of sea level rise is the thermal expansion of seawater as it warms.  Just as climate varies by region, the impacts of global climate change will vary on local scales due to the uneven distribution of solar heating, individual responses of the atmosphere, oceans and land surface, interactions between these and the physical characteristics of the regions. Within the U.S., every region has experienced warming. The period 2001-2011 was warmer than any previous decade on record (Figure 1.2).   The National Climate Assessment released new climate scenarios in Figure 1.4. Changes in precipitation over the USA since the 1900s. The colors on the map show annual total precipitation changes (percent) for 1991-2011 compared to the 1901-1960 average, and show wetter conditions in most areas (Melillo et al. 2014) \u2022 (Figure source:  Figure 1.3. Future temperatures for 2071-2099 based on four scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions. RCP 2.6 assumes rapid reductions in emissions (70% cuts from current levels by 2050) and smaller warming. The RCP 8.5 scenario assumes continued increases in emissions and therefore in warming. RCP 4.5 and 6.0 are intermediate scenarios (Melillo et al. 2014).   20 its 2014 publication. All simulated temperature increases show the northeastern U.S. warming by 5\u00b0-10\u00b0 F by the end of the 21st C.  Precipitation is shifting around the world. Most regions of the U.S. show increasing trends in precipitation (Figure 1.4). Increased temperatures increase the evaporation of water. Water vapor in the atmosphere traps heats and further contributes to warming. It also creates more humidity, clouds and rainfall in already wet regions. In the future, computer models estimate that wetter regions will get wetter and drier regions will get drier (Figure 1.5).   Increases in precipitation typically come as heavier storm events. One measure of a heavy-precipitation event is a 2-day precipitation total that is exceeded on average only once in a five-year period, also known as the once-in-five-year event. The occurrence of these extreme precipitation events has become much more common (Figure 1.6; (Melillo et al. 2014). Additionally, the number of high-energy storms, such as category 4 and 5 hurricanes have increased roughly 80% over the last Century (Melillo et al. 2014).  2. Vermont\u2019s rising temperatures Vermont average temperatures have increased 2.7\u00b0 F since 1941. Since 1960, average temperature has increased 1.6\u00b0 F, and since 1990, average temperatures increased 0.9\u00b0 F. The last decade was the warmest on Figure 1.5. Projected percent change in seasonal precipitation for 2070-2099 (compared to the period 1901-1960) under an emissions scenario that assumes continued increases in emissions (A2). Teal indicates precipitation increases, and brown, decreases. Hatched areas indicate confidence that the projected changes are large and are consistently wetter or drier. White areas indicate confidence that the changes are small. (Melillo et al. 2014) Figure 1.6. Observed trends in heavy precipitation in the northeastern U.S. since 1900 (Melillo et al. 2014).   21 record, with average temperatures increasing by 0.4\u00b0 F. 1 Across Vermont, temperatures are warming, with increases occurring twice as fast in winter than in summer. Summer temperatures have increased by 0.4\u00b0 F per decade over the last 100 years. Winter temperatures are increasing faster, at the rate of 0.9\u00b0 F per decade with increasing variability, but a strong overall trend. In lowland regions, represented by 8 of the 12 Vermont climate sites, annual average temperatures have increased by 0.4\u00b0 F per decade since 1960 (Figure 1.7). In the mountainous regions, represented by 4 of the 12 Vermont climate sites, annual average temperatures have increased by 0.8\u00b0F per decade since 1960 (Figure 1.8) (NWS 2014).  Average temperatures have been rising more rapidly in recent years. Averaging over lowland regions, annual average temperature increased by 1.5\u00b0 F (0.8\u00b0 C) degrees between 1990 and 2012, with an average increase of 0.7\u00b0 F (0.4\u00b0 C) degrees per decade. For highland regions between 1990 and 2012, annual average temperature increased 1.8\u00b0 F (1\u00b0 C), or 0.8\u00b0 F (0.45\u00b0 C)                                                           1 All climate data for Vermont were analyzed for this report and were provided curtsey of NOAA/National Weather Service and the Burlington regional office.

In the last decade alone (2000-2010), average temperatures in lowland areas increased 3\u00b0 F (1.6\u00b0 C); in highland regions, temperatures increased 2.5\u00b0 F (1.4\u00b0 C). Changes in annual average temperature have been affected by increasing winter average temperatures in recent years.  3. Winter severity Winter severity in Vermont has and will continue to decrease as overnight low temperatures steadily climb. As a result of warmer winters, rivers and lakes in Vermont have been frozen by 7 less days per decade. Spring has started 2-3 days earlier per decade, such that the growing season has increased by 3.7 days per decade. Vermont has already transitioned from hardiness zone 3-5 to 4 and 5 only, as a result of warmer winter minimum temperatures.  The winter severity in Vermont is decreasing even faster than warming is occurring. Local and regional temperatures are strongly regulated by snowfall. The winter warming trend is partially explained by lower snow cover that allows the land to absorb solar radiation and warm. A snow-covered surface reflects sunlight, helping maintain cooler temperatures. Evaporation from unfrozen snow-free land increases atmospheric water vapor, a strong greenhouse gas which traps heat and further warms the surface \u2013 a second positive feedback. A study in Saskatchewan demonstrated that the first snowfall causes temperatures to decrease by 18\u00b0 F (10\u00b0 C), with the reverse pattern happening with snowmelt (Betts et al. 2014).   One measure of winter severity is the number of \u201cfreeze\u201d days (Figure 1.9, top). Freeze days occur when the minimum recorded temperature is at or below 28\u00b0 F (-2.2\u00b0 C). In Vermont, we see a 20% decrease Figure 1.10. Changes in the date of the first and last freeze since 1960. Figure 1.9. Change in the length of the growing season (bottom) and number of days below 28\u00b0 F (freeze days) recorded at the Burlington Airport.   23 in the number of freeze days since the 1940s. During the 1940s-1960s, Vermont averaged 131 days below freezing each year. In the last decade, Vermont has averaged just 120 days below freezing each year.  Like the number of freeze days, the dates of first and last freeze are also changing (Figure 1.10). The date of the first freeze has been moving later in the fall by 2.8 days per decade since the 1960s. The date of the last freeze has progressed from mid- to late-May to as early as late-May, at a rate of 2.6 days earlier per decade.  The decreasing winter severity means a lengthening of the growing season (Figure 1.9, bottom). The length of the growing season is defined as the number of days that are not freeze days. The growing season has steadily lengthened over the period of record from an average of 160 days in the 1940s to 176 days in the last decade (Figure 1.9, bottom). On average, growing season length has increased by 0.66 days per year since 1941. Since 1960, growing season has lengthened at a rate of 0.24 days per year.  Throughout Vermont, average winter temperatures have warmed 0.1\u00b0 F (0.05\u00b0 C) per year since 1940. For lowland areas only, winter average temperatures have increased 0.3\u00b0 F (0.17\u00b0 C) per decade since 1960; in mountainous regions, winter temperatures have increased by 0.2\u00b0 F (0.1\u00b0 C) per decade since 1960. Winter average nighttime minimum temperatures have increased from -20\u00b0 F (-28.9\u00b0 C) in 1940 to -12\u00b0 F (-24.4\u00b0 C) in recent years, a change of 1\u00b0 F (-17.2\u00b0 C) per decade. Warmer nighttime temperatures decrease snow cover, leading to warmer ground and air temperatures.  Farmers and gardeners measure winter severity in terms of plant hardiness zones as determined by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). These zones serve as a guide to which plants will thrive in their region. The zones are defined by the average annual winter minimum temperatures in bands of 10\u00b0 F (-5.6\u00b0 C). With lengthening growing seasons and warmer nighttime temperatures, Vermont is experiencing a change in its hardiness zones. In 1990, regions in Vermont were in the USDA\u2019s Hardiness Zone classes 3, 4, and 5. In the last decade, the zones have changed to predominantly classes 4 and 5 (Figure 1.11). This change in plant suitability may allow new, economically-important crops to be grown in Vermont. However, it may have negative impacts on native species adapted to this region. (See Chapter 6: Forests for more information on climate impacts on native forests.)  Figure 1.11. Change in USDA Hardiness Zones for the Northeast from 1990 to 2006.   24 4. Frozen water bodies One effect of rising temperatures is that Vermont\u2019s lakes are frozen 7 fewer days per decade. Because the natural climate of Vermont varies across the state, the impacts of human-induced climate change will not be smooth across the state or over time.  Ponds and lakes in Vermont will be frozen for shorter periods of time as winter temperatures warm. There is evidence that the warming trends discussed above have already decreased the length of the ice-covered season for many of Vermont\u2019s most famous water bodies (Figure 1.12). On average, Vermont\u2019s lakes are frozen for 7 fewer days per decade. This trend will likely continue into the future. Earlier trends in \u201cice out\u201d correlate to temperature observations of warmer springs and shorter winter seasons. The record of ice cover on Lake Champlain indicates less frozen periods over time, but the record should be eyed with some scrutiny (Figure 1.13). The methods, purpose and quality of observations for ice in Lake Champlain have varied greatly over time. In the 1880s, the \u201cclosing\u201d of the ice on Lake Champlain was pertinent to commercial shipping that was more prevalent at that time than it is today. If Burlington Harbor were \u201cclosed\u201d due to ice, the record may show the Lake was closed with no indication of the true extent of ice. Did this mean the whole lake was iced over? We may never know for sure. During the 19th C, records were sporadic. Circa 1910, The U.S. Weather Bureau Climatological Record Book for Burlington, VT reports the annual closing data for Lake Champlain from 1816-1871, with some citations from the Burlington Free Press. From 1872-1886, closings of the Harbor were recorded by Charles Allen dockside. From 1886-1906, records were kept by NWS cooperative weather observer Mr. W.B. Gates from the same dockside location.  From 1906 onward, records have been kept by the U.S. Weather Bureau or National Weather Service, although the methods for determining the closing of Lake Champlain continued to vary throughout the 20th C. From the 1940s-1970s and perhaps 1980s, Figure 1.13. Timing of freeze-up on Lake Champlain shown by measurement type. From 1816-1940, freeze was defined as ice cover on Burlington Harbor. From 1940-mid 1980s, freeze up was noted as the time when the ferry stopped running due to ice. Since 2008, freeze-up has been measured by complete ice coverage on the lake, as measured by high-resolution satellite imagery (NWS 2014).   25 many of the \u201cclosed\u201d observations came from pilots flying over the lake and reporting they saw it iced over. From the 1980s-mid 2000s, the definition of \u201cclosed\u201d was used only when the Ferry had to stop running due to ice\u2014representing a much larger extent of ice cover than the 1800s definition. Since 2008, the National Weather Service has been using high-resolution satellite imagery to determine the date of complete ice coverage on the lake. When the Lake does close with ice, it is now happening later in the winter. Given the amount of potential error due to different types of measurements, this is difficult to assess. Examining just the aerial and satellite observations (1940-present) shows an average delay in freeze-up of 0.4 days per decade, although this estimate has a high degree of error due to high-frequency noise inherent to the data set (RMSE 9.7). Box 1.1. Joe\u2019s Pond Ice-Out Contest The Joe's Pond Ice-Out Contest benefits the Joe\u2019s Pond Association Annual Fireworks fund and pays out roughly $5,000 to each year\u2019s winner. Evolving from a topic of conversations around town, \"When do you think the ice is going out?,\" friendly wagers were made until 1987 when the president of the Association turned the game into an official contest. The challenge came in determining a fair way to judge the exact date and time of ice-out, which occurred a little differently each year. Since 1988, a simple, low-tech control system has been in use. An electric clock was placed on H. Fitts\u2019 deck with a tether to a cinder block wired to a wooden pallet placed 100 feet from the shore on top of the ice. When the block sinks, the clock is disconnected and records the \u201cofficial\u201d ice-out time. The winner is the contestant closest to the date and time of official ice-out. The contest has grown from a recorded 1,500 tickets in 1990 to over 12,000 in the last few years. In 2013, a few changes came to Joe\u2019s Pond Ice-out Contest. The pallet and flag were moved to a new location and the old electric alarm clock was replaced with a weather-proof clock. Both the clock and pallet can now be monitored by webcam on the Joe\u2019s Pond Association Ice-Out website (The Joe's Pond Association 2014).   Figure 1.12. A popular Vermont tradition is guessing the date of ice melt at Joe\u2019s Pond in West Danville. Since its inception in 1988, the date of ice-out has come 7 days earlier. The day of Ice Out is significantly correlated to winter temperatures. During warmer winters, Ice Out happens earlier. Data provided by Joe\u2019s Pond Associate and the National Weather Service for St. Johnsbury, VT as West Danville does not have a complete record (NWS 2014, The Joe's Pond Association 2014).  26 5. Increasing precipitation Vermont\u2019s annual precipitation is increasing by 1.0\u201d per decade since 1941. Some parts of the state have experienced even greater increases, particularly mountainous regions. More winter and spring precipitation is projected for Vermont over this century, initially increasing snowfall but, as temperatures rise, later increasing winter rainfall. Weather stations across Vermont show increasing precipitation, averaging an increase of 1.0\u201d per decade since 1941 (Figure 1.14). Averaging over lowland areas in Vermont, annual precipitation has increased by 0.9\u201d per decade since 1960. Annual precipitation in mountainous regions has increased 2.3\u201d per decade since 1960. The amount of rain events with high intensity rainfall is increasing dramatically (Figure 15). From 1960-1980, Vermont averaged 4 days with precipitation greater than 1\u201d. For the last two decades, these intense precipitation events occur on average 7 days a year, with many observations over 10 days per year.   Snowfall increases so far have been more extreme in the mountainous areas than in the valleys due to cooler temperatures at elevation. For example, Burlington snowfall has increased 10% since 1954 while Mt. Mansfield snowfall has increased 22% (Figure 1.16). We expect annual snowfall to increase over the next 20-25 years and then decrease as temperatures warm to cause more rain than snow (Christensen et al. 2013, NWS 2014). Snowfall is showing increasing variability, with record snowfall and much lower than average snowfalls coming year to year. Figure 1.16 highlights the variability in snowfall that may come from year-to-year. On average for the last 30 years, Vermont has had a cumulative snow depth of 573 inches. In the last three years, we Figure 1.14. Change in annual precipitation from 1941-2013 (BTV station). Figure 1.15. Number of days per year with greater than 1\u201d of precipitation (BTV station). Figure 1.16. Snowfall in Burlington and Mt. Mansfield 1954-2013.  27 have seen a wide range of cumulative snow depths, from 80, 86 and 292 inches in 2011-2012, 2013-2014 and 2012-2013 to 1073 inches in 2010-2011 (Burlington Airport Station) (NWS 2014). Since 1960, low lying areas in Vermont have experienced a 1.1\u201d decrease per decade in cumulative snow depth; in mountainous regions over the same time period, snow depth has decreased by 0.7\u201d per decade. However, even average values across all climate sites have fluctuated widely since 1960, and this may not continue in the future.   6. Extreme Weather Events Certain types of extreme weather events have become more intense and frequent in Vermont, including floods, and high-energy storms. Anecdotally, the impacts of extreme weather events are having an increasing impact on Vermonters. As precipitation becomes more flashy, that is, occurring in larger bursts over shorter periods, flood risk increases. Flooding in 2011 was devastating in some localities as Tropical Storm Irene swept through the region and delivered large volumes of water in just a few days. Further analysis of the state\u2019s response to flood resiliency can be found in the chapters on community development, agriculture, and water resources.  In the winter of 2013-2014, the \u201cpolar vortex\u201d engulfed much of the U.S. east of the Rockies, bringing ice and snow to 49 of the 50 states. In this weather pattern, the jet stream moves far south of its normal range and gets \u201cstuck.\u201d This \u201cquasi-stationary blocking pattern\u201d allows storm after storm to hit a region for weeks at a time. In 2013-2014, Vermont experienced this phenomena and had a number of colder than average periods for longer than average. During a similar quasi-stationary blocking pattern in May 2013, Vermont experienced multiple days of record rainfall, often over 4\u201d per day. It is difficult, nay impossible currently, to predict how quasi-stationary blocking patterns will develop and affect Vermont\u2019s climate in the future. This is because these patterns are new, having seldom been observed in the historical climate record so computer models of weather and climate lack sufficient data to predict and project these systems into the future. It is believed that the quasi-stationary blocking patterns are a result of melting sea ice. The loss of ice and resultant heating of the Arctic Sea decreases the surface pressure gradient from the equator to the North Pole. Under normal conditions, this pressure gradient  28 guides the jet stream. Under a weakened gradient, the jet stream has the ability to move further south and end up in a short-term (1-3 weeks) blocking pattern. For more detail on this phenomenon, see recent articles by Francis 2013, Tang et al. 2013 and Francis and Vavrus 2012.  Globally, we expect climate change to increase the intensity of storms as heating of the atmosphere allows it to carry more water. Locally, we can use measured lightning strikes as a proxy for the energy carried in storms. Looking back to 1986, we see a generally increasing trend in lightning strikes (Figure 1.17).  7. Changes in Lake Champlain Changes in the water level and temperature in Lake Champlain show no evidence of significant changes due to climate. Lake Champlain\u2019s water level is sometimes reported to be increasing. This is an artifact due to the damming of Lake\u2019s outlet in the late 1960s, which caused water levels to rise (Figure 1.18). Adjusted for the height changes due to the dam, there is no significant change in Lake Champlain\u2019s water level despite increased precipitation to the region.    94959697981907191419211928193519421949195619631970197719841991199820052012Feet  MSLLake Champlain Lake Level Burlington VT1907-2013Avg LevelAvg Level AdjustedFigure 18.

Chittenden County, Vermont: Cloud to ground lightning strikes.  29 Another misconception is that water temperatures in Lake Champlain could rise due to warming atmospheric temperatures. In fact, water temperatures in the lake have been slowly dropping as the water volume in the lake has increased (Figure 1.19) (NWS 2014).   8. Summary Table Rating Quality of Information  Key Message 1 Global climate is changing now, driven by human activities and amplified by water cycle processes, and this change is apparent across a wide range of observations. Global climate is projected to change over the next century, although the exact magnitude of climate change will depend primarily on the amount of global greenhouse gas emissions and the response of the climate to these emissions. Description of evidence base Ninety-nine percent of scientists agree that climate change is happening now. This is documented globally (Christensen et al. 2013) and within the United States (Melillo et al. 2014).  New information and remaining uncertainties  The Vermont Climate Assessment provides local analysis of changing climate that provides more detail for the state than national and international reports.   Assessment of confidence based on evidence Given the evidence base and remaining uncertainties, confidence is very high that climate change is happening globally and in Vermont.  CONFIDENCE LEVEL  Very High  High Medium Low Strong evidence (established theory, multiple sources, consistent results, well  documented and accepted methods, etc.), high consensus  Moderate evidence (several sources, some consistency, methods vary and/or documentation limited, etc.), medium consensus  Suggestive evidence (a few sources, limited consistency, models incomplete, methods emerging, etc.), competing schools of thought  Inconclusive evidence (limited sources, extrapolations, inconsistent findings, poor documentation and/or methods not tested, etc.), disagreement or lack of opinions among experts Key Message 2 Vermont average temperatures have increased 2.7\u00b0 F since 1941. Since 1960, average temperature has increased 1.6\u00b0 F, and since 1990, average  30 temperatures increased 0.9\u00b0 F. The last decade was the warmest on record, with average temperatures increasing by 0.4\u00b0 F.  Description of evidence base Evidence for the long-term increase in temperature is based on analysis of daily average, maximum and minimum temperature observations from the U.S. Cooperative Observer Network and the National Weather service (NWS 2014). A temperature increase is projected to continue rising (Christensen et al. 2013, Melillo et al. 2014).   New information and remaining uncertainties  A potential uncertainty is the sensitivity of temperature trends to bias adjustments that account for historical changes in station location, temperature instrumentation, observing practice, and siting conditions. For quality purposes in this study, we focused on stations that had not moved over time or had instrumentation problems.   Assessment of confidence based on evidence Given the evidence base and remaining uncertainties, confidence is very high that temperatures in Vermont are increasing, with the greatest increases in winter temperatures.   CONFIDENCE LEVEL  Very High  High Medium Low Strong evidence (established theory, multiple sources, consistent results, well  documented and accepted methods, etc.), high consensus  Moderate evidence (several sources, some consistency, methods vary and/or documentation limited, etc.), medium consensus  Suggestive evidence (a few sources, limited consistency, models incomplete, methods emerging, etc.), competing schools of thought  Inconclusive evidence (limited sources, extrapolations, inconsistent findings, poor documentation and/or methods not tested, etc.), disagreement or lack of opinions among experts Key Message 3 Winter severity in Vermont has and will continue to decrease as overnight low temperatures steadily climb. Spring has started 2-3 days earlier per decade, and the growing season has increased by 3.7 days per decade. Vermont has already transitioned from hardiness zone 3-5 to 4 and 5, as a result of warmer winter minimum temperatures. Description of evidence base Evidence for the changes in seasonality are documented in weather measurements across Vermont back to at least the 1960s (NWS 2014) and is expected to continue to change (Christensen et al. 2013, Melillo et al. 2014).   New information More work should be done to understand how seasons will change across latitudes and elevations of Vermont.   31 and remaining uncertainties   Assessment of confidence based on evidence Given the evidence base and remaining uncertainties, confidence is very high that seasons in Vermont are changing.   CONFIDENCE LEVEL  Very High  High Medium Low Strong evidence (established theory, multiple sources, consistent results, well  documented and accepted methods, etc.), high consensus  Moderate evidence (several sources, some consistency, methods vary and/or documentation limited, etc.), medium consensus  Suggestive evidence (a few sources, limited consistency, models incomplete, methods emerging, etc.), competing schools of thought  Inconclusive evidence (limited sources, extrapolations, inconsistent findings, poor documentation and/or methods not tested, etc.), disagreement or lack of opinions among experts Key Message 4 One effect rising of temperatures is that Vermont\u2019s lakes are frozen 7 fewer days per decade. Because the natural climate of Vermont varies across the state, the impacts of human-induced climate change will not be smooth across the state or over time.  Description of evidence base Evidence for changes in the freezing period for lakes and rivers comes from observational (NWS 2014) and empirical data (The Joe's Pond Association 2014). Precipitation is expected to continue increasing, following more as rain than snow by 2050 (Melillo et al. 2014).   New information and remaining uncertainties  Using citizen observations, such as ice-out on Joe\u2019s Pond, is a new way to document local climate change. Collection of similar data sets from around the state would improve our understanding of Vermont\u2019s changing climate.  Assessment of confidence based on evidence Given the evidence base and remaining uncertainties, confidence is very high that water bodies are frozen for fewer days than in the past.   CONFIDENCE LEVEL  Very High High Medium Low  32  Strong evidence (established theory, multiple sources, consistent results, well  documented and accepted methods, etc.), high consensus  Moderate evidence (several sources, some consistency, methods vary and/or documentation limited, etc.), medium consensus  Suggestive evidence (a few sources, limited consistency, models incomplete, methods emerging, etc.), competing schools of thought  Inconclusive evidence (limited sources, extrapolations, inconsistent findings, poor documentation and/or methods not tested, etc.), disagreement or lack of opinions among experts Key Message 5 Vermont\u2019s annual precipitation is increasing by 1.0\u201d per decade since 1941. Some parts of the state have experienced even greater increases, particularly mountainous regions. More winter and spring precipitation is projected for Vermont over this century, initially increasing snowfall but, as temperatures rise, later increasing winter rainfall.  Description of evidence base Evidence for the long-term increase in precipitation is based on analysis of daily precipitation observations around Vermont (NWS 2014).  New information and remaining uncertainties  A potential uncertainty is the sensitivity of precipitation trends to bias adjustments that account for historical changes in station location, temperature instrumentation, observing practice, and siting conditions. For quality purposes in this study, we focused on stations that had not moved over time or had instrumentation problems.

Description of evidence base Evidence for the increase in high-energy storms has been directly observed with an increase in lightning strikes. Regional and national reports indicate an increase in high levels of precipitation in single rain events. These trends are expected to continue (Christensen et al. 2013, Melillo et al. 2014, NWS 2014).   New information and remaining uncertainties  Quasi-stationary blocking patterns are expected to bring longer duration rains and storms in addition to the other causes of increase extreme weather events. Because these patterns were seldom historically observed, NOAA/National Weather Service has little information to inform their models to project when these blocking patterns might occur.     Assessment of confidence based on evidence Given the evidence base and remaining uncertainties, confidence is very high that extreme weather events in Vermont are increasing.

Local, regional and state policies and initiatives are imperative to adapting to climate change and reducing the impacts already underway. \uf0b7 Current action at the state level centers around: 1) adaptation (e.g., infrastructure and land use planning), 2) mitigation (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions reduction programs) and 3) resilience through education and planning at the community and regional levels. Policy action is already well-underway, including the establishment of the Governor's Climate Cabinet in 2011; development of additional river corridor protection programs and authority in response to Tropical Storm (TS) Irene; and legislation to advance the state goals of a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2028 and 90% of energy from renewable sources by 2050. This is supported by a constituent base that values climate change action across the state. \uf0b7 Proposed policy and management alternatives are being analyzed by Vermont\u2019s nonprofit and higher education organizations with input from stakeholders. Current programs in Vermont are focused on building local-level capacity, working to understand the critical social networks for climate change education and adaptation, and planning for future sustainability.  \uf0b7 State policies are designed as collaborative efforts across various sectors involving a variety of perspectives through levels of government and volunteer networks. Such collective action is necessary to effectively address the threats of climate change to our social, economic and environmental well-being in Vermont.   DEFINITIONS Resiliency: is the capability of social and or natural systems to respond to and recover from climate change events. Adaptation: is the process of adjustments that social ecological systems make in response to changing situations to reduce vulnerability from climate change impacts.  Mitigation: is a proactive process that moderates climate change disruption through reducing our overall contribution to emissions.  36 The ability to build resiliency depends on successful adaptation and mitigation strategies being implemented across social and natural systems.  Climate change policy in the state of Vermont should aim to build resiliency through both adaptation and mitigation practices. 0. Introduction This chapter serves to provide a background on the development of Vermont Climate Change Policy and an overview of current programs in place.  It includes a brief but comprehensive overview of the programs and policies and how they were established.  Additionally, this introductory chapter outlines some of the opportunities and challenges that have arisen throughout the process and prompts future critical thinking for planning in the short and long-term with regards to projected climate change impacts to the State of Vermont.  Major climate change threats are addressed through state policies regarding: air pollution, flooding, energy, natural disasters, and emergency response.  Current priorities include: 1) reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, 2) transitioning to more renewable energy sources, 3) undertaking state-level research on climate change, and 4) building statewide resilience to climate change.  This chapter breaks these priorities into two categories, those that are primarily focused on mitigation and those that are primarily focused on adaptation (note the definitions of mitigation and adaptation at the beginning of this chapter).  Policies aimed at adaptation have primarily focused on community flood resilience (response to TS Irene), but include other topics (economy, tourism, agriculture).  Mitigation programs have focused on greenhouse gas emission reduction and efficiency and renewable energy solutions that contribute to emission reductions. 1. Adaptation Policies and Programs  1.1 State Level Planning for Climate Change Research: 2005 \u2013 Governor\u2019s (Douglas) Commission on Climate Change2: The Commission on Climate Change was a two-year, multi-stakeholder effort.  It included six commission members; thirty-one plenary group members; four sector-based technical working groups.  In 2007 a major report was published as a comprehensive review of the state\u2019s emissions and potential reductions in four broad categories, 1.) Energy Supply and Demand, 2.) Transportation and Land Use, 3.) Agriculture, Forestry and Waste and 4.) Cross Cutting Issues (e.g. GHG emission inventory, Public Education and Outreach, Adaptation, State Operations Emissions).  The culminating result was a presentation of 38 policy recommendations and over 200 proposed actions to identify the efficiency measures generally most cost-effective with the highest potential for success in Vermont.  While the overarching goal is to reach attainment of all policy recommendations, the Commission acknowledges the need for further analysis of many of the options (ANR, 2007). In order to start this process the Commission identified six overarching recommendations for the Governor to prioritize:   1. Building on Vermont\u2019s Energy Efficiency Leadership and Renewable Energy Potential 2. Keeping Our Farms, Farms and Our Forests, Forests                                                             37 3. Reducing Emissions in a Renewed Transportation System Within and Between Vibrant Town Centers 4. Educating and engaging Vermonters about Climate Change 5. Leading by Example 6. The Vermont Climate Collaborative: A Signature Partnership of Vermont\u2019s Government, Academic, and Private Sectors  These six primary categories are driving strategies to respond to GHG emission reductions across sectors. Figure 2.1 shows the gross GHG emissions, historically and projected, broken out by sectors that correlate with the six priority areas. For a table list of the full 38 policy recommendations, please see page 9 of the Plenary Group Recommendations Appendices at ANR Climate Change team website. As part of the continued policy focus on responding to impacts from climate change and working to achieve the Climate Change Commission goals, a cross-agency cabinet was formed in the spring of 2011.  The Cabinet\u2019s work is guided by four priorities: (1) increasing the use of hybrid electric vehicles; (2) implementing the new energy plan; (3) reducing emissions from state buildings and operations; and (4) developing good metrics to track Vermont\u2019s progress. The Climate Change Cabinet brings together agency members and focuses on meeting the state\u2019s ambitious climate adaptation goals through the organization of five working groups. The working groups are assigned unique tasks to work on as they pertain to the policy recommendations from the climate change commission (Johnstone, et al., 2010). Climate Change Team Working Groups Electric Vehicles State Operations Data & Metrics Flood Resiliency Health The work of these groups is accomplished by members of the Climate Change Team which is staffed through the Climate Cabinet with representation from 8 State Agencies.  Each group has taken on the responsibility of working with different sets of priority recommendations from the Figure 2.1 Vermont GHG emissions by sector, 1990 \u2013 2030: assuming continued DSM  38 Commission on Climate Change.  For example, the state operations working group leads projects such as evaluating and implementing state fleet efficiencies, carpooling/ride share, teleworking, web conferencing and so on. The 2007 report from the Governor\u2019s Climate change Commission also recommended the state develop a comprehensive Climate Change Adaptation Plan (Tetra Tech and ANR, 2013). In result, there are a multitude of past and ongoing efforts focused on climate change at the state planning level.  Below is an outline of some of these programs and initiatives.  More information can be found on the state\u2019s websites as outlined in Table 2.1.  Vermont Climate Collaborative http://www.uvm.edu/~vtcc/ Established October 2008, retired May 2011.  Originally conceived by Governor Douglas / President Fogel as a research coordination body. Evolved into a stakeholder information exchange forum.  Vermont Climate Cabinet http://www.anr.state.vt.us/anr/climatechange/ClimateCabinet The Vermont Climate Cabinet was established in May 2011.  The cabinet includes members from the Agencies of Natural Resources (Chair), Agriculture Food and Markets, Commerce & Community Development, Economic Housing and Community Development, Administration, Building and General Services, Public Service Department, VTrans, and Department of Health.    Vermont Climate Change Team http://www.anr.state.vt.us/anr/climatechange In order to help achieve the goals set forth by the governor and the State of Vermont, the Agency of Natural Resources has convened a Climate Change team to focus on identifying climate-related threats and recommending solutions to mitigate impacts.  The team works to understand and implement adaptation strategies that will enable the state to be better posed to handle the impacts of climate change. 1.2 Agency of Natural Resources Vulnerability Assessment: Adaption Framework for Natural Resource Sectors This year-long process included two stakeholder engagement opportunities \u2013 vulnerability assessment and adaptation.  This project examined the effect of a changing Vermont climate on four important habitat/ecosystems: lakes and ponds; rivers and streams; upland forests; and wetlands.  The primary structure included a review of current climate forecasts, incidence of exposures to climate change and measurement of vulnerability as expressed by (Exposure x Sensitivity) \u2013 Adaptive Capacity.  The measurement assumes that climate change increases Table 2.1 State-level planning efforts related to climate change Table 2.2 Common climate change themes relevant to the four main habitats of Vermont  39 exposure to stress. Sensitivity is partially a function of other stressors (habitat loss, toxics). Adaptive capacity varies with species and the related stressors.  The results found certain common themes across habitat groups (Table 2.2).   Common Themes Potential Results Compositional changes associated with changing climatic conditions (long-term, localized effects could occur on shorter timescale) Loss of cold-adapted species; Increase in warm-adapted species Increase in physiological stress (immediate)   Particularly concerned about summer heat and/or water limitation; Note: Champlain Valley is naturally hotter and drier than other parts of VT. Increase in susceptibility to disease and pests (immediate) Increased risk of threat to health of habitat groups Increase in disturbance (i.e. from extreme storm events) (immediate) Facilitates the spread of invasive plants and species              2. Mitigating Policies and Programs 2.1 Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions:   In 2005, Vermont set a goal of reducing emissions 25% below 1990 levels by 2012. Figure 2.2 shows this goal was not met, even though there has been a decrease in Vermont\u2019s total emissions Figure 2.2 GHG Measured emissions compared to 2012 \u2013 2028 goals. Source: http://www.anr.state.vt.us/anr/climatechange/Vermont_Emissions.html  40 since 2004. The aggressive goals set forth by the Governor\u2019s (Shumlin) Comprehensive Energy Plan, passed by legislature in 2012, requires continued active effort and as the plan calls out in its executive summary, \u201cwill not wait for slow policy development or be cured by small progress (PSD, 2011).\u201d The Vermont legislature established statewide GHG emission reduction goals (GHG Emissions Goals 10 VSA $578 (2005)) in 2005 based on the New England Governors and Eastern Canadian Premiers (NEG-ECP) Climate Change Action Plan, 2001, emissions \u201cLead by Example\u201d goals for state Governments. The baseline year used is 1990, and the baseline emissions that the reductions are calculated on is 8.11 MMTCO2e (this is the measurement unit that expresses million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent).  Vermont\u2019s goals describe a fairly aggressive reduction trajectory (Table 2.3).  Goal Target Date 25% reduction from 1990 levels (6.1 MMT CO2e). (Actual reduction from 1990 levels was not achieved by target date) 1/1/2012 50% reduction from 1990 levels (4.1 MMT CO2e) 1/1/2028 75% reduction from 1990 levels (2.0 MMT CO2e) if practicable using reasonable efforts, 1/1/2050 The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative helps to support Vermont\u2019s GHG reduction goals and helps to provide resources and funding for enhancement of energy efficiency programs across the state. 2.2 Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI):  The RGGI program established a regional partnership to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from electrical generation facilities across 10 states in the northeast from Maine to Maryland.  This initiative was the first market-based regulatory program created in the United States to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Originally proposed by NY Governor Pataki in 2003, the initiative was actually launched in 2009, and the 10 states involved have cooperatively achieved great successes.  The only state no longer involved in the initiative is New Jersey which withdrew in 2012.  Emission permit auctioning began in September 2008, and the first three-year compliance period began on January 1, 2009. Proceeds are used to promote energy conservation and renewable energy. Although, as of 2010, three states had used some of the money to balance the overall budget. The original number of GHG emission allowances allotted to Vermont and other states were so large that the program didn\u2019t result in a direct reduction of emissions. Rather the funds raised by the auctions were used to promote programs that are working to reduce emissions in Vermont (such as the Home Energy Challenge described below). Figure 2.2 outlines investments made by program type as of 2012 data.  Table 2.3 Vermont\u2019s greenhouse gas emission reduction goals  41 The program uses a cap-and-trade market-based approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  Essentially, each state is given a share of allowances, each allowance equal to 1 metric ton of CO2 emissions. The states then sell these emission allowances through an auction process. States can then invest the proceeds in energy efficiency projects, like the Home Energy Challenge, a program for increasing energy efficiency projects by homeowners.  Investments can also made in a multitude of renewable energy projects and other clean energy technologies.  In Vermont, RGGI funds are used to support the state\u2019s energy efficiency utility Efficiency Vermont. As an indicator of success, after three years of running, the cap of allowed emissions from regulated power plants was 165 million tons in 2013, but the actual emissions measured in 2012 only totaled 91 million tons.  Representative of the program\u2019s ambitious nature, a significant tightening in the cap was announced in 2013 for the second compliance period going through 2015 bringing the allowance of emissions down to 91 million tons (a 45% reduction) with a plan for a continued 2.5% annual decrease through 2020.  While these figures point to the success of the overall initiative, the decrease in emissions below the cap is likely due to the increased use of natural gas and other economic variables.  Nonetheless, there are various highlights to be mentioned pertaining to Vermont\u2019s success with the program.  Funding from RGGI has helped the Vermont Community Energy Mobilization Project, a volunteer-based program that works with private homeowners (Efficiency Vermont, 2013b).  This program has successfully installed home energy-saving measures estimated at 590,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity and 1,750 MMBTU of heating energy since 2010.  Additional funding from RGGI has also allowed for the Efficiency Vermont Home Energy Challenge to provide incentives up to $2,500 for home energy retrofit projects.  Total revenue to VT: $740,000 in 2012 to Vermont Energy Investment Corp through the Public Service Department (PSD). Participation in RGGI coupled with Efficiency Vermont\u2019s contributions to the regional grid, have also fund Vermont\u2019s thermal energy and process fuel efficiency programs that support the delivery of energy efficiency services to Vermont heating and process fuel consumers. The result includes cost-effective efficiency measures and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from those sectors (RGGI, 2012a).  Collectively, the RGGI programs contributing to heating and process fuel efficiency programs have served 2,400 households and 130 businesses. According to the American Council for an Figure 2.3 RGGI Investments by Program Type (RGGI.org)   42 Energy Efficient Economy, Vermont was the fifth in the nation in making energy efficient investments in 2012 (RGGI, 2012b). 2.3 Renewable Energy Solutions, VT Legislature Energy Acts:   The Vermont legislature has addressed the state\u2019s future energy use many times over the past 25 years, with a focus on energy efficiency and more recently renewable energy development. Energy costs and reliability have been important criteria in new legislation. Programs of particular interest include:  o Efficiency VT, developed in 2000 to promote education and technical assistance to Vermonters in order to reduce energy costs, bolster local economy and mitigate negative environmental impacts by increasing energy efficiency across homes and businesses around the state, initially with a focus on reducing electrical energy consumption o SPEED Program (Sustainably Priced Energy Enterprise Deployment) Enacted by the Vermont legislature in 2005 with a goal to increase the development of in-state renewable energy sources using renewable fuels.  The program set a goal to reach 20% of total statewide electric retail sales to be SPEED resources comprised of new renewable energy during the year starting on January 1, 2017.  One of the current criticisms with SPEED renewable projects is that they are allowed to sell their renewable energy credits into the regional market (since VT does not have a Renewable Portfolio Standard). Some consider this \u201cdouble counting\u201d of renewables, and believe that it doesn\u2019t result in any net increase in renewable generation in the region. Earlier this year, CT acted to make RECs purchased by regulated entities from VT renewable projects ineligible for credit toward their RPS. Upcoming issues pertaining to Vermont\u2019s renewable energy transition goals revolve around improving a plan to implement a renewable portfolio standard for electricity, completing a total energy study and enhancing thermal efficiency infrastructure. In 2008, the State set a goal to building thermal efficiency to improve substantially the energy fitness of at least 20 percent of the state\u2019s housing stock by 2017 (more than 60,000 housing units), and 25 percent of the state\u2019s housing stock by 2020 (approximately 80,000 housing units).  See Chapter 4: Energy for more information on energy and climate change in Vermont.  2.4 Comprehensive Energy Plan 2011: The Vermont Public Service Department (PSD) is required by Statute 30 VSA 202(b) dated 1981, to update state\u2019s Comprehensive Energy Plan (CEP) every 5 years. The last plan was completed in 1998. In 2011, Governor Shumlin reaffirmed this requirement and the PSD published a new Comprehensive Energy Plan in December 2011. In 2011, Governor Shumlin reaffirmed this requirement and the PSD-produced plan by the end-of-year deadline. The Statute requires that the plan\u2019s revision process include a statewide stakeholder process of public hearings. Vermont\u2019s 2011 CEP established the goal of 90 percent of the state\u2019s energy coming from renewable sources by the year 2050.  The PSD is now in the stakeholder engagement planning process as part of the Total Energy Study to meet this new goal for the next report due out in 2016.  After the release of the TES, there will be a second round of stakeholder meetings as part of the planning process for the CEP.  For more information and the full report please see the Public Service Department\u2019s website.  43 2.5 Total Energy Study - Public Service Department: The total energy study was commissioned as a requirement by legislature in the Energy Act of 2012.  The act reads reaffirms the 90% renewable goal by 2050 while meeting the following statutory goals:  Goal Target Date VT Statute 127.5 MW of new in-state renewable electric generation contracts provided through the Standard Offer program of SPEED 2022 (30 V.S.A. \u00a7 8005a(c)) 25% of all energy from in-state renewables 2025 (10 V.S.A. \u00a7 579(a)) 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions; 75% by 2050 2028 (10 V.S.A. \u00a7 578(a)) 75% renewables in electric sales 2032 (30 V.S.A. \u00a7 8005(d)(4)(A) The Public Service Department has initiated a process to develop information in support of the next CEP. During the summer of 2013 the PSD organized and facilitated stakeholder focus groups on ten energy topics (e.g. electrification, solid biomass, liquid biomass, other renewables, residential energy,  commercial building and industrial energy, transportation and land use, alternative fuel vehicles and infrastructure). The overarching goal of the focus groups was to gather information to provide to the state\u2019s contractor who is working to develop alternative technology and policy sets that can achieve the act\u2019s stated goals. Figure 2.4 illustrates the current mix of energy in Vermont, grouped by energy type and then summarized into three principal sectors, transportation, residential and commercial and industrial.  2.6 Energy Siting Commission 2012: The energy siting commission was created by the Governor\u2019s Executive Order October 2012, in response to concerns regarding process for issuance of a Certificate of Public Good for Renewable Energy projects (particularly utility-scale wind).  This commission was tasked with providing guidance and Figure 2.4 Vermont\u2019s 2011 Energy Breakout by Sector and Energy Type Table 2.4 Statutory goals for meeting greenhouse gas emission reduction goals in the Energy Act of 2012  44 recommendations on best practices for the siting approval of electric generation projects larger than the net metering threshold.  It also served to spur public participation and representation in the siting process (PSD, 2013a). The report, published in April of 2013, contains the following recommendations to be presented for consideration by legislature:  o Increased emphasis on planning at the state, regional and municipal levels, such that siting decisions will be consistent with RPC plans o Adopted a simplified tiered approach to siting  o Increased opportunities for public participation, and increased transparency, efficiency and predictability of the process o Updated environmental, health and other protection guidelines The recommendations have helped to provide a strong foundation for both identifying valid issues and for future planning to move towards increasing levels of renewable energy consumption for the state.  The key recommendations for siting present a plan that suggests the public service board interacts closely with regional plans for review and approval to be consistent with the state statutes.  Additionally, municipal plans would be considered and reviewed carefully to be integrated into the regional and state goals.  The end goal is that these recommendations will help to engage towns and regions more effectively in the state\u2019s energy planning and increase their roles in achieving Vermont\u2019s renewable energy goals. 2.7 Thermal Efficiency Task Force 2012 Final Report January 2013: Recommends public investment of $27M in 2014 to $40M in 2020 to meet statutory weatherization goals. The status of these decisions will very likely be discussed in the upcoming legislative session. It is unclear if PSD will put forward a proposal or if key legislators will lead the discussion. Either way, the hope is that these funds would leverage approximately twice as much private investment. The idea is that public money will encourage financial institutions to lend for the balances, since loan amounts (and presumably risk) will be reduced (PSD, 2013b). 2.8 Vermont-Quebec Electric Vehicle Charging Corridor:  The State of Vermont has invested in a 138-mile corridor of Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations.  This project was conceived during the 2012 NEG-ECP.  Developed by the Agency of Natural Resources and administered by the Agency of Commerce and Community Development, this initiative provides financial resources for electric vehicle charging stations in all of Vermont\u2019s designated downtowns.  Acknowledging that the transportation sector is one of the biggest contributors of greenhouse gas emissions the State recognizes this investment as a priority in responding to strategies for transition to lower environmental impacts from vehicles.  In part from support like this, the adoption of electric vehicles in Vermont has been following an upward trend, as of July 31st, 2012 nearly 300 electric vehicles were registered throughout 100 cities and towns in Vermont (EIC, 2012).  45 3. Building Statewide Resilience to Climate Change 3.1 Act 16 of 2013 \u2013 Municipal and Regional Flood Planning and Flood Resilience In July 2013, the legislature passed a new ruling to encourage flood resilient communities in Vermont.  The act requires: (A) New development in identified flood hazard, fluvial erosion, and river corridor protection areas should be avoided. If new development is to be built in such areas, it should not exacerbate flooding and fluvial erosion. (B) The protection and restoration of floodplains and upland forested areas that attenuate and moderate flooding and fluvial erosion should be encouraged. (C) Flood emergency preparedness and response planning should be encouraged. Municipalities must work to update their town plans to include the flood resilient element either as a part of their land use section or in an existing flood section of their hazard mitigation plan if they have an adopted plan in place.  The state is providing support through the Agency of Natural Resources and regional planning commissions around the state are also helping to guide towns in the process.  The act goes into effect July 1, 2014 and will hopefully be influential in shaping a new perspective of land use planning that better mitigates and plans for risk of flooding events across the state. To provide support, ANR works with municipalities and regional planning commissions directly and has also published a website to help guide planners through the necessary steps for updating a town or regional plan (ANR, 2013). 3.2 Resilient Vermont Project \u2013 Institute for Sustainable Communities The Institute for Sustainable Communities, a nonprofit organization located in Montpelier and focused on helping communities around the world address environmental, economic and social challenges, has been engaged in an 18 -month stakeholder engagement process to evaluate policies and programs for \u2018Preparing for Natural Disasters and the Effects of Climate Change in the Green Mountain State\u2019. The Resilient Vermont project, organized by ISC and supported by the High Meadows Fund, the Waterwheel Foundation, Jane\u2019s Trust, Lintilhac Foundation, and generous donors to ISC\u2019s Climate Fund, has partnered with the State of Vermont, the Vermont Natural Resources Council and the Vermont League of Cities and Towns to work towards making Vermont a model of community, economic and environmental resilience. The idea of this project is to provide decision makers and stakeholders from across state and local governments, businesses and non-profits with information on strategies to  Figure 2.6 Resilient Vermont wordcloud from Institute for Sustainable Communities  46 mitigate risks of climate change and future hazards to our environment and economy. The project has relied on and continues to engage citizens and communities concerned with the growing challenges of extreme weather events and the vulnerabilities we currently experience in the face of damaging natural disasters. Strategies and priorities for actions towards creating a more resilient landscape focus on strengthening Vermont\u2019s ability to adapt to changes and to reduce negative impacts on the environment, economy and communities.   The process has included a variety of stakeholder events through which ISC has collected information on work going on around the state relating to preparedness for changes in weather events, like Tropical Storm Irene of August 2011. The final output of the program is to provide information on specific vulnerabilities and direct attention through policy and program recommendations to priority areas for building resilience. The culminating report from the project includes recommendations that present solutions and strategies for building capacity of Vermont organizations and state agencies to engage in a long-term sustainable plan for a stronger more resilient Vermont. ISC has fervently worked to put together the most complete compilation of work going on around the state and glean from this body of knowledge both a current assessment of vulnerabilities facing Vermont by sector and an outline of opportunities for action moving forward (ISC, 2013).   3.3 Recommendation for Vermont Climate Action Plan A strong policy recommendation for Vermont could be a formalized Climate Action Plan. Vermont already has a multitude of programs, policies and projects completed or underway that would serve as the components of a climate action plan. Specifically, the policy recommendations from the Commission on Climate Change cover many topics and strategies that climate action plans hold in other locations across the country. Commonly seen through city planning processes, climate action plans lay out strategy and goals that combine work across sectors and across government levels for a stronger unified force in responding to climate change. Plans encourage broad participation for creation and demand continuous progress evaluation towards meeting goals. With examples of innovative strategies for responding to climate change, the climate action plans adopted in cities like Chicago, New York, Seattle and Portland could inspire Vermont to take the necessary steps to formalize many of the great efforts thus far. A Vermont climate action plan would assure continued action and support into the future for both near term and long term adaptation and mitigation strategies to become increasingly resilient to climate change impacts. Box 2.1 Portland, OR\u2014first local government in the U.S. to adopt a strategy to reduce carbon emissions In 2009, the City Council of Portland, OR passed, at the time, one of the most aggressive climate change policy programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The vote was passed unanimously, 4-0 and outlined a 40 year plan to reduce GHG emissions 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. The goals are outlined in a Climate Action Plan that incorporates the surrounding Multnomah County,  47 addresses energy use in buildings, transportation, urban planning and agriculture.  There is a strong focus regarding building a local green economy that aims to contribute to deepening the foundation for success in achieving the plan\u2019s goals.  The plan is comprised of 93 actions that are to be reviewed every three years to monitor progress.  Some specific targets include: Net zero GHG emissions in new homes and buildings; Energy use in current buildings reduced 25%; and Neighborhoods designed so 80% of county residents (90% of city residents) can walk or bicycle to meet daily needs. Miles driven per day reduced 30% per person. Solid waste reduced 25%. 90% of waste reused or recycled. Locally grown food increased significantly Urban forest expanded to cover a third of Portland (Daily Sustainable Business News, 2009).  The 2012 review reported a success story as carbon emissions landed on a downward trend.  Additionally, the report cited that emissions from home energy use had declined 7% from 1990 levels with over 1,000 homes going through weatherization process through Clean Energy Works Oregon, solar panel installations on over 1,400 homes and businesses and nearly 150,000 households compost food scraps at the convenience of curbside pickup by the city (BPS and OS, 2012). The two year progress report also shows that of all actions outlined in the 2009 Climate Action Plan, 58% are on track and 12% have been completed.  Of particular importance to achieving these actions has been the coordination across numerous bureaus and departments within two different agencies and the host of community partners dedicated to the success of the City Council\u2019s mission in reducing carbon emissions and mitigating the pace of climate change.  4.

The Governor\u2019s 2013 Energy Generation Siting Policy Commission.      49 Chapter 3: Community Development  Ann Hoogenboom1   1 SunCommon, formerly of the Gund Institute for Ecological Economics, University of Vermont  Key Messages \uf0b7 Rural and urban communities around Vermont are at risk of climate change impacts, from both steady changes over time in temperature and precipitation as well as single occurrence extreme weather events.  Impacts are forecasted to continually shape communities, as climate affects Vermont\u2019s primary economic sectors such as agriculture, recreation, tourism, and forest products.  Many communities have already been highly impacted and are engaged in processes to respond to climate change related transitions through formal planning. \uf0b7 Communities across the state are undergoing adaptation planning.  Climate change impacts will continue to require adaptation planning on local, regional and state levels.  Regional and watershed based planning perspectives will become more crucial as the State works to protect its important economies and communities. Land use planning must acknowledge climate change impacts via smart growth development strategies, improved stormwater management and flood resilient planning. \uf0b7 The infrastructure systems of Vermont\u2019s communities are highly vulnerable to climate change.  A mountainous, rural geography combined with small rural communities with limited transportation routes and communication systems elevate this vulnerability.  Antiquated water infrastructure and aging built-infrastructure pose additional challenges, particularly given limited economic resources available for adaptation. \uf0b7 Resilient communities will engage in hazard mitigation planning to respond to increased emergency response needs from vulnerable populations, rural communities and areas that have been exposed to extreme weather events, particularly flooding. The State will need to continue to lead in hazard mitigation planning and provision of guidance and support to local communities.  This chapter underscores the importance of understanding community dynamics particular to the State of Vermont in building strategies to respond to the risks of climate change.  Building resilience on a community level is typically connected to adapting land use practices and assessing infrastructure vulnerabilities to prioritize recommendations for adapting to weather related damages and mitigating future risks. The Vermont Climate Assessment Community  50 Development chapter aims to detail the current impacts of climate change on communities in Vermont and the current and potential strategies that can be applied in response.  1. Many communities have already been highly impacted by changes in weather and are engaged in processes to respond to climate change related transitions. 1.1 Land Use: Land use planning is a principal component of community planning for climate change.  Changes in climate are already forcing communities to reevaluate land uses due to implications of increased climate variability.  Development inherently threatens ecological resilience as fragmentation of large tracts of land break connective systems required for natural structural viability.  Between 1980 and 2005, approximately 23.8 million acres of the 26 million acre Northern New England Forest region changed ownership (Fidel, 2008). In Vermont, many towns were originally built along rivers during a time when hydropower was the main energy source.  Today, historic downtown villages are continually threatened by increases in flooding events.  Vermont\u2019s strong agricultural economy has also shaped its landscapes and land use configurations.  Over 20% of Vermont\u2019s landscape is classified for agricultural uses, where humans have large impacts, such as changed natural meanders of rivers. Figure 3.1 shows the increase in disaster declarations from 1962 \u2013 2011 with an upward trend showing significant increase in the last five years. The upward trend is Figure 3.2: Channelization of Mad River in Waitsfield, VT, showing change in river pathway in blue from 1973 \u2013 2004. Figure 3.1: FEMA major disaster declarations in Vermont in five year increments. Adapted from VTrans Climate Change Adaptation White Paper.  51 attributable to an increase in storm events and continuing development in vulnerable areas (Johnson, 2012). 1.2 River Channelization: Channelization of rivers in Vermont is one of many examples of how human systems have affected the natural stability of natural systems making them more vulnerable to climate change.  Channelization is the process of stopping a river\u2019s movement to protect private investments and public infrastructure (Kline and Cahoon, 2010). The negative impact of channelization is a process that increases river slope and velocity which subsequently allows for greater power to dislodge or move sediment and debris along the river bed, especially when flow is high.  The resulting effect is a river with much greater capacity to erode and transport hazardous levels of debris during flooding events.  Bank armoring is often part of the channelization process which involves excavation of sediment beds, adding to negative impacts.  Channelization typically depletes natural habitat, threatens water quality and inhibits the natural process of vital floodplain development (floodplains are necessary for water storage in times of increased water levels).  The VT Agency of Natural Resources, through the Department of Environmental Conservation\u2019s Rivers Program, has worked with various watershed groups and municipalities to complete over 145 assessments of flood vulnerability involving 170 communities across the state.  This work is promoting improved planning for land uses that foster flood resilient communities.  The continued understanding of river corridor planning will be an asset to communities as state policies increase focus on improving municipal planning to protect vulnerable infrastructure and natural habitats.  Figure 3.3: Towns with approved Municipal Plans Box 3.1 Media coverage on extreme storms The Rutland Department of Public Works Commissioner, Jeff Wennberg, said after a severe storm with golf ball size hail that caused flooding in Rutland on May 27, 2014 \u201cIn a six-year period we\u2019ve had six storms that were deemed 10-yr storms or worse, and Irene was a 500-year storm. Our storm water system just wasn\u2019t built for this level of intense storms.\u201d --Rutland Herald, May 28, 2014  52 Extreme weather events require strategic municipal, regional and state planning.  Fortunately, there has been an upward trend over the last decade in adoption practices of formal land use planning throughout the state but continued adaptation and expansion of these policies is required as Vermont faces new impacts from climate change.  Figure 3.3 shows the increase from 1991 - 2003 in municipalities that have adopted formal town plans, to date, only 9 of Vermont\u2019s 251 municipalities have not ever engaged in adopting a formal town plan.  As detailed in Chapter 1 on Climate Change Policy, Vermont is taking steps to implement progressive policies that will help to build more resilient communities in the face of climate change. Act 110, passed in February 2011, directed the Secretary of Agency of Natural Resources to establish a river corridor management program and shoreland management program. In 2012, the Legislature passed Act 138, complementing Act 110 in expanding the state\u2019s regulatory and technical assistance programs for river and floodplain management. The Rivers Program mentioned above, helps to integrate floodplain management as directed by FEMA\u2019s National Floodplain Insurance Program (NFIP) with three major planning elements: fluvial erosion hazard avoidance, river corridor and buffer protection and river science (FEMA NFIP 2014). 1.3 Flooding: Climate models show increased projections of flood events in many locations across the country due to increased precipitation falling in single or prolonged events.  Vermont has seen recent trends that support these projections.  There have been recorded increases in stream flow and projections for earlier thaw dates in the winter and more percentage of precipitation falling as rain rather than snow, all of which increase potential for spring flooding and heightened water table levels  Figure 3.4 shows the recurrence of flooding events throughout Vermont from the early 1970\u2019s through 2011. The map also illustrates how floods are impacting the whole state at one time or another. Highlighted red lines mark the severe recurring flooding over the last 5 years (Betts, 2011).     Figure 3.4: Recurring flooding events in Vermont from 1970 \u2013 2011. Red lines show significant flooding events over last 5 years.  53 1.4 Disaster Declarations:  Communities will become more dependent on emergency management systems as climate change perpetuates increased damaging storm events.  Between 2007 and 2011, FEMA made 11 disaster declarations in the State of Vermont, mostly due to intense precipitation (ISC, 2013). Every single county in the State of Vermont announced FEMA disaster declarations in response to flooding events in 2011. Communities will need to work to better understand the hazards they potentially face and how to respond appropriately in the short term and adapt efficiently in the long term.  Vermont\u2019s rural and fragmented communities pose additional challenges for implementation of effective emergency response systems.  Our ability to remain connected, technologically and responsively through emergency response will determine the success of enhanced resilience to a changing climate.  Local governments adopt Emergency Operations Plans (EOP) on a town-specific basis. Additionally, at the State level, the Vermont Department of Emergency Management and Homeland Security (DEMHS) has its own EOP. Many communities have an emergency management director, but this is typically a volunteer position.  This person will serve as the command and control officer in the event of an emergency.  There is also regional support through 10 local emergency planning committees located throughout Vermont that help to support emergency preparedness (ISC, 2013). The current system is set up such that in the event of an emergency, all efforts are coordinated through the State Emergency Operations Centers (SEOC) which are located in Waterbury, VT. There are potential vulnerabilities in a system that relies on individuals or on one specific location for response if disaster events cut communication from these key people and places. 1.5 Hazard Mitigation Planning:  Hazard mitigation planning takes place both at the municipal and state levels.  The State of Vermont has a Hazard Mitigation Plan (HMP) that incorporates statewide strategy for all types of natural hazards.  This plan was redrafted in May 2013 through the Department of Public Safety\u2019s Division of Emergency Management and Homeland Security (DEMHS).  The plan includes risk and vulnerability assessment of natural, atmospheric and technological hazards that pose potential threat to the citizens of Vermont.  It outlines a mitigation strategy and with goals and action items for continued resiliency to future threats.  The plan also communicates a coordination strategy for local mitigation planning and integration.  As is required by the Federal Emergency Management Association (FEMA), all Hazard Mitigation Plans must also detail a planning process Figure 3.5: VPR Mapping the Money Project illustrating state federal aid support received by town for damages incurred by Tropical Storm Irene, 2011.   54 and the steps for continued maintenance of the plan to monitor and evaluate its success and procedures (VEM, 2013). It is important for towns to officially adopt HMPs in order to be eligible for certain federal recovery support and grants for rebuilding or even pre-disaster planning projects.  With continued projections of extreme weather events, adaptation may require that we build upon and expand the current systems so that Vermont communities are more aptly prepared.  Strategies could include building up at the local level or expansion from the top down with state leadership.  Some Vermont agencies are engaged in plans to create a system that calls on qualified reservists in the event of an emergency.  The State is working to support Hazard Mitigation Planning through ACCD\u2019s Strong Communities program and ANR\u2019s Flood work (ACCD, 2013; ANR, 2013).  Towns across Vermont are working to create and adopt HMPs, particularly those that have experienced damages.  2. Communities across the state are undergoing adaptation planning.    Climate change impacts will continue to require adaptation planning on local, regional and state levels.  Regional and watershed based planning perspectives will become more crucial as the State works to protect its important economies and communities. Land use planning must acknowledge climate change impacts via smart growth development strategies, improved stormwater management and flood resilient planning.  2.1 Smart Growth Development:  The processes of development planning will continue to impact our ability to become more resilient to climate change. Smart growth development focuses largely on better development and use through updated planning related to water supplies, sewage treatment and transportation in town centers and villages to allow for more efficient use of land and energy. Efficient use implies improved adaptive capacity as well as mitigation of contributions to climate change. The Agency of Commerce and Community Development recently released a report with recommendations for smart growth development through an EPA-supported partnership for sustainable communities working with the Department of Transportation and Department of Housing and Urban Development.  The project selected one community in central Vermont to analyze and worked with the local Figure 3.6: Four recommendations for smart growth development to plan for resiliency to future flooding in Vermont. Credit: State of Vermont  55 planning district to put out the final strategies for preparing for future flooding that are now being communicated to other communities around the state.  The recommendations for adaptation focus on four primary areas and give suggestions for action: (1) In River Corridors: Conserve land and avoid development in particularly vulnerable areas such as floodplains and river corridors, (2) In Vulnerable Settlements: Where development already exists in vulnerable areas, protect people, buildings, and facilities to reduce future flooding risk, (3) Safer Areas: Plan for and encourage new development in areas that are less vulnerable to future flooding events and (4) Upland and Everywhere: Implement stormwater management techniques to slow, spread and sink floodwater. The Vermont Downtown Action Team is also working with ACCD to build plans to strengthen economic vitality of seven downtown villages that were impacted by heavy flooding as a result of 2011\u2019s Tropical Storm Irene (ACCD, 2012a). 2.2 Act 16 Flood Resilient Planning (ANR Strong Communities Program):  In July 2013, the Vermont Legislature passed Act 16, regarding municipal and regional planning and flood resilience.  The act addresses two components; that all municipal and regional plans will include a flood resilience element and that accessory dwelling units may be regulated in hazard areas.  The purpose and goals are as follows:  \u00a74302. PURPOSE; GOALS (14) To encourage flood resilient communities. (A) New development in identified flood hazard, fluvial erosion, and river corridor protection areas should be avoided. If new development is to be built in such areas, it should not exacerbate flooding and fluvial erosion. (B) The protection and restoration of floodplains and upland forested areas that attenuate and moderate flooding and fluvial erosion should be encouraged. (C) Flood emergency preparedness and response planning should be encouraged.  The legislation goes into effect July 1, 2014.  Towns that do not comply will not be eligible for certain funding and grant opportunities. Additionally, in order to qualify for the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), towns must comply with federal guidelines that this act acknowledges and seeks to build upon.  The plan explicitly details the requirement of state support for towns and regional planning commissions to fulfill these requirements.  Through the Resilient Communities program under the Agency of Natural Resources, the department is working to help provide technical assistance and outreach.  A website has been developed that provides information and communication tools for planners, and a more complex website through the Focus on Floods Initiative is planned to be released early next year (ANR, 2013).  The Agency is also assisting municipalities in their efforts to adopt flood resilience plans through supporting a river corridor mapping program through the Department of Environmental Conservation.  This program is working to produce maps that identify floodplains, river corridors, land adjacent to streams, wetlands, and important upland forest areas.  56 In Vermont, many damages occur outside of floodplains, nonetheless, the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) delineates boundaries based on floodplain maps and municipalities that seek financial support through the NFIP must follow these maps in their planning processes.  Currently, almost 90% of Vermont\u2019s 251 municipalities participate in the NFIP.  Additionally, around 17% have adopted regulations that protect river corridors or floodplains. Moving in the right direction, Vermont towns will need to continue to adopt these kinds of regulations to respond to future threat of projected reoccurring flooding events. 2.3 Stormwater Management Strategies:  Increases in precipitation will require improved statewide stormwater management systems.  Strategic stormwater management will improve our ability to respond to the threats of extreme weather events. Climate change forecasts of changes in precipitation make Vermont particularly vulnerable to flooding and issues related to water quality. This vulnerability is born from the state\u2019s geographical structure of mountainous valleys with many of the state\u2019s downtown villages and agricultural lands located in correlating floodplains.  Stormwater management has not historically been planned through strong regional collaboration which is crucial in order to build resilience through watersheds.   There are 18 different watersheds in Vermont.  Currently, the State has no comprehensive stormwater management system that aligns with watershed jurisdiction. Rather, the Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation Stormwater Program is directed through a permit structure for new development, redevelopment and expansion projects.  Permits are issued separately for runoff from impervious surfaces, construction sites and industrial sites.  The primary goal of the State Stormwater Permit Program is to regulate discharges (runoff) from impervious surfaces (ISC, 2013). While Act 16\u2019s new legislation does not explicitly detail adaptation planning or updated regulations around stormwater management, it does directly link the importance of protecting intact forested landscapes as providers of important flood regulating services. Protection of natural lands that attenuate flood waters during increased heavy precipitation events will be a crucial step for Vermont in building resilience to the impacts of changes in precipitation. With changes in climate, Vermont will need to implement strategies outside of regulation and inclusive of adaptation.  Stormwater planning will require both urban system adaptations and large green infrastructure planning through methods such as wetland conservation or protection of valuable upland forestlands.  Urban stormwater management includes smaller scale green infrastructure projects such as city rain gardens or underground rain catch systems.  The State Stormwater Program outlines Water Quality Practices that: \uf0b7 can capture and treat the full water quality volume (WQv),  \uf0b7 are capable of removing approximately 80% total suspended solids (TSS) and 40% total phosphorus (TP) removal, and \uf0b7 have acceptable performance and longevity in the field.   57  Table 3.1 Water Quality Practices (Vermont Stormwater management manual)  Water Quality Practice Description of practice Stormwater Ponds Practices that have a combination of permanent pool and extended detention capable of treating the WQv. Stormwater Wetlands Practices that include significant shallow marsh areas, and may also incorporate small permanent pools or extended detention storage to achieve the full WQv.  Infiltration Practices Practices that capture and temporarily store the WQv before allowing it to infiltrate into the soil. Filtering Practices Practices that capture and temporarily store the WQv and pass it through a filter bed of sand, organic matter, soil, or other media.  Open Channel Practices Practices explicitly designed to capture and treat the full WQv within dry or wet cells formed by check dams or other means.   3. The infrastructure systems of Vermont\u2019s communities are highly vulnerable to climate change.  A mountainous, rural geography combined with small rural communities with limited transportation routes and communication systems elevate this vulnerability.  Antiquated water infrastructure and aging built-infrastructure pose additional challenges, particularly given limited economic resources available for adaptation.  Climate change has had and will continue to have a significant impact on infrastructure systems in Vermont. With increasing stream flows, Vermont\u2019s roads, bridges, dams and water systems are all at increased risk.  Transportation infrastructure tends to mirror river corridors and many roads are in vulnerable valley regions where towns are often located.  Vermont\u2019s mountainous geography with deep river valleys perpetuates water runoff risks.   Climate models show a continuous increasing trend in precipitation levels in Vermont.   Figure 3.11, provided by the National Weather Service, shows historical data tracking precipitation levels from 1910 \u2013 2010 measured in the months of December and January.  The blue line shows this increasing trend through time.  With these projected increases in precipitation, both in the form of snow and rain, we also expect to see increases in extreme weather events that result in flooding events or inundation of land in floodplains. Water infrastructure needs to assure that we will be able to supply clean drinking water. Transportation infrastructure will need to be adapted to withstand stream erosions and flooding events. Built infrastructure will need to be reinforced, particularly in floodplains and fluvial erosion hazard areas.  Complicating this in  58 Vermont is that many infrastructure systems are aging and in serious need of repair regardless of climate change impacts.  3.1 Water infrastructure: Restoring clean water to the state will require an estimated investment of $156 million per year for ten years (Dolan, 2013). Water infrastructure throughout Vermont is antiquated and under- prepared for both isolated flooding and larger flood events both with regard to wastewater and drinking water management.  The Vermont Section of the American Society of Civil Engineers released a report card for Vermont\u2019s infrastructure in February 2012 that evaluated Vermont\u2019s roads, bridges, dams, municipal drinking water and municipal wastewater systems.  The grades ranged from C to D- in all five categories.  In order to sustain current functioning and be able to respond to potential damages from an increase in extreme weather events, Vermont needs to invest in upgrading and adapting these systems to be more resilient. A subsequent report was published for the Vermont General Assembly in Accordance with Act 138 passed in 2012.  The report, titled, Water Quality Remediation, Implementation and Funding Report was released in January 2013.  The report details costs and actions for priority improvements.  The summarized estimate of restoring clean water to the state is $156 million per year for ten years. Compounding the challenge of costs needed to update our water infrastructure is the issue of supply networks across rural communities and the location of many valley communities that are located in floodplains.  The state has a total of 1,367 public water systems and nearly 90 percent serve less than 500 people (ANR, 2011).  Many of the municipal systems are run by limited staff capacity and lack adequate inventory of system structure and condition.  While the State provides support through low- interest loans through its Drinking Water and Wastewater State Revolving Funds, and communities can use municipal bonds to fund projects, there is an overwhelming gap in the funding needed to become adequately prepared for events such as extreme flooding.  Some communities have been engaged in safeguarding water infrastructure to be more prepared for flooding including construction of backup well heads or placing bypass pipe systems above the 100 year floodplain elevation.  The town of Waterbury has received state assistance in developing an asset management plan to prioritize replacement of infrastructure that is most vulnerable to failure. Communities will need to continue to better Figure 3.11 Change in annual precipitation from 1941-2013 (BTV station). See Chapter 1.   59 understand the needs of protecting groundwater and safeguarding or repairing wastewater systems as weather events will continue to impact these systems.  3.2 Transportation Infrastructure Much like our water infrastructure, the State\u2019s transportation system will require substantial investments.  Figure 3.12 shows a report card evaluation completed in 2011 by the American Society of Civil Engineers Vermont Chapter.  The report card details that roads are in poor condition with a grade of a D+.  Flooding poses the greatest risk to transportation infrastructure, but more acute erosion, extreme heat events and winter storms will also create damages.  The damages from Figure 3.12 Report card for Vermont\u2019s infrastructure by American Society of Civil Engineers Vermont Chapter. Figure 3.13 Skagit River Basin climate-risk study results showing vulnerability levels to flood and sea level rise risks of climate change projections in Western Washington State. Credit: Washington Department of Transportation.  60 Tropical Storm Irene\u2019s flooding totaled over $200 million to Vermont\u2019s State Highway system affecting over 500 miles of roads and 200 bridges throughout the state. Again, Vermont\u2019s rural nature compounds the complexity of maintaining a strong transportation network.  Over 2,884 miles of class 1 & 2 roads and 8,531 miles of class 3 roads are under local jurisdiction, landing a high level of financial responsibility on already burdened town budgets (ISC, 2013). It will be important to identify high risk areas both based on current condition or roads, bridges, culverts and dams combined with level of threat of flooding or other weather events.  Washington State conducted a Risk Based Asset Management analysis that determined a statewide picture of the areas with greatest vulnerabilities producing a map that identifies prioritization areas for repairs or upgrades based on threats from sea level rise projections.  The Washington Department of Transportation was able to conduct this study through a matching grant program with the Federal Highway Administration. The Vermont Agency of Transportation (VTrans) has been engaged in work with the Agency of Natural Resources to build long-term resilience through \u201cFlood Resiliency Training Programs\u201d to educate stakeholders on best management practices.  Additionally, VTrans has been working to develop Transportation Resiliency Plans outlined on a watershed basis to identify high risk areas, similar to the work of a risk based asset management program like the example in Washington State (Johnson, 2012).  Strong support for these types of programs must continue as we work to adapt to a changing climate.  In 2008, VTrans published a Climate Change Action Plan, recognizing the need to leverage the transportation sector\u2019s capacity to effect change in levels of GHG emissions in Vermont with transportation accounting for 44 percent of Vermont\u2019s overall GHG emissions. The Climate Change Action Plan has three primary focus areas; (1) reducing GHG emissions from the transportation sector, (2) protecting Vermont\u2019s transportation infrastructure from the threats of climate change, and (3) reducing Vtrans\u2019 operational impacts on climate change. Focus in response to severe damages to infrastructure over the last couple of years as a result of both widespread and isolated flooding has shifted towards research to identify climate related thresholds to Vermont\u2019s transportation infrastructure, a process that aims to help guide decision making for investments and planning. The state and local towns are recognizing an increasing need to upsize infrastructure to accommodate geomorphic conditions and stream flows that are Figure 3.14. Increasing lightning strikes indicate increasing intensity of electrical storms (NWS 2014).    61 out of equilibrium. In the last ten years, ANR has worked with communities and assessed more than 8,000 of Vermont\u2019s 23,000 river and stream miles. This work reveals that over 75 percent of assessed river miles are out of equilibrium, rendering them as unstable (ANR, 2011). The instability of river corridors threaten the environmental health of ecosystems and greatly increase risk for impact from storm events to our transportation system (Kline and Cahoon, 2010). In combination with assessing rivers, attention is being directed at bolstering asset inventory data related to transportation and water infrastructure both at the municipal and state level. In the town of Sharon, the river corridor plan assessment completed in 2010 prepared under contract by the Two Rivers-Ottauquechee Regional Commission reports findings identifying over 30 percent of culverts in the White River Watershed as incompatible with existing geomorphic stability (Fitzgerald Environmental Associates, LLC, 2010). With climate projections for increased extreme storm events, these vulnerability and risk assessment inventories are a valuable asset and will collectively support building resilient systems in Vermont. 4. Resilient communities will engage in hazard mitigation planning to respond to increased emergency response needs from vulnerable populations, rural communities and areas that have been exposed to extreme weather events, particularly flooding. The State will need to continue to lead in hazard mitigation planning and provision of guidance and support to local communities.  4.1 Communications infrastructure: Telecom Increases in lightning storms and electrical charge of lightning threatens communications infrastructure.  Climate models show projections of increasing cloud to ground lightning strikes.  With the projected increase in heavy storms there is a potential increase in risk of destruction and damages to our telecom and communications infrastructure.  Figure 3.14 shows the increasing trend in lighting strikes since 1986 along the dotted line. Increasing trends in electrical storms will put our communication systems out of order during times we need them most to communicate emergency response. 4.2 Human Well-being, looking at elderly, impoverished, foreign/non-native populations The rural nature of Vermont poses increased threats from climate change.  Communications and transportation systems are vulnerable to severe weather events, which can cut off individual Figure 3.15: Mobile Home Parks within Flood Damage Regions  62 households or entire towns from support that they depend on. Due to the widespread distance between households, in the event of a disaster response protocol, communication of evacuation plans or information about aid locations are more challenging.  Many towns have volunteer fire departments or municipal positions and depend on informal emergency management communication plans.  Lower-income residents are at higher risk of impacts from flooding, particularly those residing in mobile homes (which represent almost 7% of all housing in Vermont).  Mobile homes represent vulnerabilities in that there is a high level of home ownership (87% of residents owning their mobile homes) and many mobile homes were built before 1970.  This means that losses from damage are more impactful for owners and the aging infrastructure is at higher risk for damage.  Furthermore, over 80% of these residents fall into HUD (Housing and Urban Development) low Area Median Income (AMI).  Perhaps the greatest vulnerability is that many of the state\u2019s mobile home parks are located in floodplains.  More than 20% of mobile home parks have at least one lot located in a flood hazard area and just under 32% of parks have a portion of property in the floodplain.  During Tropical Storm Irene\u2019s flooding of 2011, mobile homes sustained disproportionate damages.  While mobile homes account for 7% of the state\u2019s housing stock, 15% of damages to residences reported across the state were mobile homes (Baker, 2012).  Figure 3.15 depicts a map of the state of Vermont with locations of mobile home parks. Notably, most mobile home parks in Vermont are located in floodplains.  The red dots indicate the homes that were damaged by Tropical Storm Irene (Baker, 2012). Figure 3.16 Imbalanced damages to mobile homes, FIA Credibility-Weighted Building Depth-Damage Curves as of 12/31/1998.  63 Figure 3.16 shows six Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) credibility-weighted damage functions.  The six categories, in order of the key below, are one floor, no basement, two floors, no basement, two or more floors with basement, split level no basement, split level with basement and mobile home.  As is evident, mobile home damage is significantly higher than other categories.  These numbers are based on data from damage claims for the period of 1978-1998.  The loss figures include both structure and content losses through the National Flood Insurance Program recorded claims (HAZUS Manual). 5. Adaptation and Mitigation The current work to build resilience for vulnerable populations includes both a community development element as well as specific capacity building for improving structures via housing retrofits, energy efficiency updates, alternative designs and in some cases relocation.  The work associated with policies such as Act 16 will help to protect the floodplains that mobile home parks are often located near or in and efforts for improved river corridor management help to build resilience for these communities. The Vermont Planners Association is currently engaged in the promotion of Climate Resilience planning elements in town and regional plans. The association has membership of about 150 professional planners, landscape architects, engineers and planning consultants across the state. While this effort has not been taken up by the legislature yet, some communities are addressing climate resilience in their plan updates. In Vermont, towns are required to update plans every five years. Building resilience to climate change impacts will become more effective as broader acceptance of these standards are adopted by communities during planning updates. The Vermont Agency of Commerce and Community Development\u2019s (ACCD) Strong Communities program is working to provide technical assistance and education on how communities can work to become more resilient through a \u201cPlan Today for Tomorrow\u2019s Flood\u201d initiative. The ACCD webpage houses information on grant opportunities, state and federal funding support and a variety of public outreach resources. Focus is on disaster recovery and long term resiliency planning in order to be more prepared for future natural disaster events. Federal funding is available through the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) for purchasing properties located in flood prone hazard zones. Federal funding is offered to qualifying properties at 75% with local community match at 25%. Following the events of TS Irene, the State of Vermont has now Figure 3.17: Pending FEMA HMGP buyouts as of May 2012. Retrieved from CDBG Action Plan.  64 committed to support the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board in working with the HMGP funding to help communities finance the 25% cost through a Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery (CDGB-DR) Program. As of July, 2012, 92 residences located in floodplains had been approved by the State and submitted for FEMA review for buyouts. These are all cases of voluntary action by property owners. Figure 3.17 illustrates the location of the pending buyouts throughout the state. Continued funding and focus will need to support these efforts to promote greater resilience in communities throughout the state. As of 2012, the total estimated unmet housing need was about $19.5 million (ACCD, 2012b). Additional adaptation planning for building community resilience in Vermont has been through a Community Recovery Partnership launched by Governor Shumlin in response to damages from Irene. The partnerships have brought State agencies, local and regional officials, nonprofits, volunteers, local business owners, State floodplain managers and infrastructure experts together to plan for more long-term solutions for recovery efforts that lay groundwork for rebuilding stronger. The partnership process included convening of meetings in 45 towns across the State drawing over 500 participants. Many of the actions and continued planning happening at the town and regional planning levels were informed by these meetings and continue to build off of the principles set regarding planning, response and recovery in these initial gatherings. The State is now focused on long-term planning working across agencies to set policies that support continued achievements towards resilience to impacts from climate change through land use, regional planning, downtown redevelopments, housing, transportation, environment and economic development (ACCD, 2012c). Individual communities are now engaging in writing Long-Term Community Recovery Plans; Wilmington and Waterbury are two examples with completed plans. 5. 1 Case Study: Lessons from early adopters Resilient Communities Scorecard \u2013 Vermont Natural Resources Council (VNRC) In February 2013, the Vermont Natural Resources Council released a tool for towns to use in building more resilient communities; a scorecard where planners, community members, selectboards and conservation and planning commissions can ask questions about their town.  Using the guidance from VNRC\u2019s scorecard, users can ascertain a score that distinguishes a town\u2019s level of resilience into three categories: Figure 3.18: Resilient Communities Scorecard (VNRC)  65 Smart Growth, In Transition, Needs Your Attention. The scorecard document is framed by 12 checklists that cover topics ranging from energy conservation to land use planning for flood zoning to effective, smart business development.  Each section starts with a help box that outlines tips to help assure accurate scoring.  These boxes give specific information on how to consider the questions being asked in that particular section.  After reading the list of questions and selecting the response that best fits the town\u2019s current state, the user can add up their points to receive a certain score of resilience.  The success of this tool is in large part attributed to the clear and direct action steps it provides for communities to take in response to their scores based off of their unique needs or characteristics.  The box to the right gives the example action steps suggested to promote vibrant communities by directing business and housing development toward compact, mixed-use town centers, at a scale of growth that fits the community and the region.     Throughout the report there are additional text boxes that provide definitions of resilience \u2018buzz\u2019 words such as \u2018open space\u2019: a term used to describe land that is not occupied by structures, buildings, roads, rights-of way, and parking lots, and which has been designated, either through an easement or permit restriction, to remain undeveloped.  You might also find the difference defined between inundation hazards and erosion hazards.  Furthermore, inspiring photos and quotes from influential planners and leaders of sectors pertaining to the various scorecard sections fill the margins, such as:   \u201cAt its most basic level resilience is about building relationships, getting people talking, connecting and creating something bigger than an individual might be able to do on his or her own. A resilient community is an empowered and collaborative network of people that organically adapts to the needs of its parts through the strength of the whole.\u201d - Joshua Schwartz, Mad River Planning District Director The scorecard shows tremendous potential in its ability to help Vermont\u2019s local decision makers address the emerging challenges of incremental and scattered development, rising energy costs, and climate change.  By evaluating strengths and weaknesses VNRC hopes to help communities promote vitality of downtowns and villages, address rising energy costs, build community resilience, reduce transportation costs, improve public health and adapt to climate change. More information on VNRC\u2019s Resilient Communities Scorecard and the full document can be found at: http://vnrc.org/resources/community-planning-toolbox/tools/vermont-smart-growth-score-card/ Box 3.2 Mad River Valley \u2013 Long-term Resilience Planning in Action  The Mad River Valley of Vermont (MRV), a community of four towns within the Mad River watershed, has experienced devastating flooding events over the last fifteen years resulting  66 in detrimental damages to farm and forestland, local businesses and residents, and wildlife habitats. The most recent flooding event in the Mad River Valley was in August 2011 from Tropical Storm Irene.  According to the Mad River Valley Planning District, damage to roads and bridges alone in Vermont exceeded $175 million.  Locally in the MRV, 1300 acres of crops were destroyed and 191 properties were damaged, in response FEMA paid out more than $36 million in aid to local residents (Noel et al., 2012). While the agricultural and recreational economies are crucial to the area, the associated land development to support these industries has led to increased sediment loading, bank erosion, river incision and deforestation/forest fragmentation.  The Mad River Valley Planning District (MRVPD) was created in 1985 as a planning body focused on identifying the agricultural, scenic, natural and recreational assets of the Valley (MRVPD, 2013).  As pressure increased to leverage conservation as a tool to protect the area\u2019s valuable watershed, the MRVPD, the Vermont Land Trust and The Friends of the Mad River (FOMR) created the Mad River Conservation Partnership.  Along with the completion of a multitude of conservation projects, this partnership has focused on protecting undeveloped tracts of forestland.  In total, 47,143 acres and counting have been conserved in the Mad River Watershed throughout the towns of Fayston, Waitsfield, Warren, Moretown and Duxbury.  In response to Tropical Storm Irene, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Sustainable Communities and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) partnered to provide technical assistance to the Mad River Valley through the EPA\u2019s Smart Growth Implementation Assistance (SGIA) project.  The SGIA project resulted in a report entitled Disaster Recovery and Long-Term Resilience Planning in Vermont, an analysis of how the MRV can reduce its vulnerability to future flooding events. The project identifies erosion hazard areas as crucial in mitigating erosion risk that leads to increased frequency and severity of flooding (FOMR, 2013). The report advises that Hazard Mitigation Plans (HMPs) should explicitly discuss land use tools that can be used to guide future development away from known flood hazard areas.  It also discusses adding regulatory audits in town plans inclusive of stream and wetland buffer requirements (EPA, 2013). In the Mad River Valley, 15% of the floodplain is currently conserved land, or 345 acres (VLT, 2013).   Through these strong community partnerships, collaborative governance networks and a deep appreciation for the social, environmental and economic landscape meaningful action is taking place in the MRV. Two of the district\u2019s towns, Waitsfield and Warren, have officially adopted Figure 3. 19. Sediment deposits from flooding.

Understanding mechanisms that can increase energy efficiency and conservation behaviors are central to this challenge. Policy decisions that leverage an understanding of behavior change could profoundly support this mitigation effort. \uf0b7 Adaptation through the use of renewable, local energy sources will be increasingly important as extreme weather events increase and threaten fossil fuel energy supplies. In addition, reducing reliance on international energy supplies increases Vermont\u2019s energy security. Current policies in Vermont create opportunities for local, renewable energy development.  \uf0b7 Increased risk of major storm events in Vermont will threaten energy infrastructure. These threats are primarily flooding and storm weather systems, including hurricanes. In June and July of 2013 alone, 70,000 separate energy outages occurred in Vermont.   \uf0b7 Energy demand will rise as temperatures in both summer and winter increase. The temperature rise in summer and the increased use of air conditioning will likely outweigh the reduction in energy demand for heating in the winter. In Vermont, forecasts to 2030 anticipate peak energy load increasing .7% annually due to an increased demand for air conditioning.   1. Overview of VT Comprehensive Energy Plan In 2011, Governor Shumlin requested an updated version of a 1998 Comprehensive Energy Plan for the State of Vermont. This extensive document assesses past trends and projections for energy use in the state. Most importantly, it documents a plan for attaining the goal of 90% renewable energy use in Vermont by the year 2050. During the planning process, the Department of Public Service collected over 9,000 separate comments from citizens in Vermont related to the business sector, communities, town energy plans and policy recommendations.   74 The Comprehensive Energy Plan articulates the strategy for major reductions in Vermont\u2019s use of fossil fuels (Figure 4.1). The state hopes to essentially eliminate the use of oil by midcentury. Efforts to achieve this goal will focus in several areas. Increased energy efficiency is critical, along with the development and use of renewable sources of electricity, heating and transportation. Electric vehicle adoption will address energy for transportation, and natural gas and biofuels will remain a practical necessity as Vermont transitions away from oil. Four areas will provide focus towards pursuing 90% renewable energy by 2050: a) Outreach and Education, b) Finance and Funding, c) Innovation and Expertise and d) Regulatory Policy and Structures. The Vermont Climate Assessment will contribute most directly to the area of Regulatory Policy and Structures with an overview of research related to energy efficiency behaviors that could inform effective policy. 2. Energy Policy in VT  Vermont has been very active in the development of energy policy promoting energy efficiency and renewable energy development. Areas of focus are overviewed below. For a more comprehensive discussion of public policy in Vermont, see Chapter 2. 2.1 Efficiency Vermont is a national leader in policy creation designed to increase energy efficiency in residential and commercial settings. It was the first state to create a statewide \u201cenergy efficiency utility\u201d in 1999 after the Vermont Legislature passed a law enabling the creation of Efficiency Vermont. \u201cEfficiency Vermont provides technical assistance, rebates, and other financial incentives to help Vermont households and businesses reduce their energy costs with energy-efficient equipment, lighting, and approaches to construction and major renovation\u201d (Efficiency Vermont website 2013).  Figure 4.1 Total energy use in Vermont, divided by fuel type. Source: Vermont Comprehensive Energy Plan, 2011.   75 In addition, Efficiency Vermont partners with other organizations around the state to provide options for increased efficiency and discounted services to customers related to thermal and electric efficiency. Efficiency Vermont is operated by the Vermont Energy Investment Corporation, under appointment by the Vermont Public Service Department. 2.2 Thermal  In 2012, the Vermont Public Service Department convened a Task Force, as recommended in the 2011 Comprehensive Energy Plan, to develop a detailed plan for a statewide whole-building approach to thermal efficiency. 2.3 Electric In 2000, Vermont enacted Energy Efficiency Resource Standards, a policy approach affecting all sales of electricity in the state. Enacting this policy is expected to generate a savings of ~6.6% from 2012 to 2014. (http://aceee.org/files/pdf/policy-brief/eers-07-2013.pdf)  3. Impacts of Climate Change on Energy Supply and Production Little doubt exists regarding whether or not the energy sector will be affected by climate change. The specifics and the time frame are unclear - but, energy supply and distribution in the United States will be affected by changes in storm frequency and intensity, temperatures, coastal flooding, in-land flooding and drought.  Three major climate trends are identified in a recent report developed by the U.S. Department of Energy (U.S. Department of Energy, 2013): 1. Increasing air and water temperatures 2. Decreasing water availability in some regions and seasons 3. Increasing intensity and frequency of storm events, flooding, and sea level rise  Of these three major trends, implications for New England and specifically Vermont include: \uf0b7 Transmission affected by increased temperatures, which have the potential to decrease the efficiency of distribution when ambient temperatures are high  \uf0b7 Renewable energy production affected by changing precipitation patterns, particularly hydropower production and solar energy \u2013 wind generation might also be affected by changing wind patterns \uf0b7 Threats to energy supplies and infrastructure from storms and flooding related to the refining and production of petroleum for heating and transportation and natural gas for electricity  76 \uf0b7 Transmission of electricity affected by direct damage from increasing severity and frequency of storms, and flooding  3.1 Energy Transmission  Increases in air temperature are projected to have an impact on the efficiency of energy transmission, particularly related to thermoelectric power plants. In Vermont this includes nuclear power plants, natural gas and biomass. A key process in energy generation involves a Figure 4.2 Vulnerabilities to climate change by energy sector. This information was collected by the U.S. Department of Energy in \u201cU.S. Energy Sector Vulnerabilities to Climate Change and Extreme Weather\u201d, June 2013.  77 phase change of steam to a liquid after steam is heated, to drive a turbine to create electricity. Significant changes in air temperature will change the differential between the temperature of steam and the surrounding air, affecting the efficiency of energy generation. The expected changes in efficiency of these systems is small. However, over the long term and considered across the New England region, where Vermont shares power generation, significant impacts are possible. (U.S. Dept. of Energy, 2013). During TS Irene 50,000 residents lost power \u2013 some for an extended period. Sustained winds of 50 mph impacted transmission lines, along with severe flooding that put many lines under water. Roads and bridges were decimated, making recovery efforts and energy systems repairs nearly impossible. Increasing severity of lightning storms could directly impact transmissions lines and transformers and outages caused by wind damage could also increase. Storm impacts are covered further in Section 4. 3.2 Impacts on Renewable Energy   Projections for wind power include changes in wind speed and wind patterns. However, these projections are inconsistent and vary according to the emissions scenario and climate model. Ultimately, there is no consensus in determining how wind power will be affected by changes in climate. Recent studies show that changes over the near term will not greatly exceed average historical variations (Pryor and Barthelmie 2011). However, it is possible that wind speeds could decrease in the Northeast, affecting wind power production. One study found that average annual wind speeds could decrease by 3-14% by mid-century (Sailor et al. 2008).  Solar energy production in Vermont could also be affected by increases in air temperature and increases in cloud cover. However, like wind energy production, this is an area for further study. Increasing temperatures do seem to affect photovoltaic output by decreasing efficiency, but the details of the change in power output depend on the materials used in the manufacturing of the panel. Further, though cloud cover and increased dust and haze could change the amount of solar radiation reaching the earth, the types of clouds (e.g. thin, cirrus Figure 4.3 Weather-related power disruptions across the United States are increasing. This graph depicts outages connected to weather events, from 2000 \u2013 2012. Source: U.S. DOE \u201cEnergy Sector Vulnerabilities Report\u201d  78 clouds versus cumulous clouds) will determine the amount of blocked radiation. (Omubo-Pepple et al. 2009).  Hydropower plants, which comprise close to 50% of Vermont\u2019s electricity supply, could be affected by increasing temperatures. Increasing temperatures will likely increase evaporative water losses and impact watersheds, reducing available water and decreasing the amount of water available for hydropower. This could reduce peak generation capacity of hydropower stations over the long term (U.S. Dept. of Energy, 2013). Water quality could also be affected by changes in dissolved oxygen, influenced by increasing air and water temperatures, which could lead to eventual changes in biodiversity and ecological communities within watersheds.   A longer growing season in Vermont could be beneficial for biofuels production. The details of effects on plant growth will vary by region, soil type and growing conditions. It\u2019s possible that warmer temperatures could also increase evapotranspiration and demand for water. However increasing atmospheric CO2 may increase water use efficiency in some species. Grower\u2019s responses to climatic changes will be key in managing climatic changes connected to biofuels. 3.3 Inland and Coastal Flooding It\u2019s likely that flooding is the most direct threat to Vermont\u2019s energy supply and distribution systems. Rainstorms are projected to become more intense, increasing the amount of precipitation falling during a single event (NOAA 2013).  The figure below shows increases in precipitation by region from 1958 \u2013 2007. The Northeast has experienced the greatest regional increases of any place in the United States. This trend is likely to continue (Betts, 2013). 4. Potential Effects of Major Storm Events on Energy Infrastructure and Supply  The potential for major disruptions from extreme weather events is an area of vulnerability for the energy supply in the Northeast, highlighted in several recent studies including two separate reports from the U.S. Department of Energy in 2013. The effect of climate change on hurricane strength and frequency is not fully understood by the scientific Figure 4.4 Increases in heavy precipitation from 1958 \u2013 2007. The Northeast will likely continue to see increases in heavy precipitation events. Source: U.S. DOE \u201cEnergy Sector Vulnerabilities Report\u201d  79 community. However, most models predict increased power in Atlantic hurricanes by the end of the 21st century, by 2-11% (NOAA, 2013).  A new phenomenon recently observed by meteorologists and climatologists is the development and impacts of \u201cquasi-stationary\u201d weather systems. As moisture increases in the atmosphere, the Jet Stream seems to be slowing down. This causes \u201cblocking\u201d of major weather systems, limiting movement (Francis and Vavrus, 2012). Some scientists speculate that this phenomenon contributed to the effects of Hurricane Sandy and more recently, the 1,000-year flooding event in Colorado in September (Betts, 2011). This phenomenon undoubtedly needs more study. In addition, increases in lightning strikes during storms have been observed in Vermont. These weather affects, influenced by a changing climate, create serious challenges for energy supply and transmission. 4.1 Atlantic Hurricanes Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, occurring in the Gulf of Mexico and far from New England, both affected natural gas, oil and electricity markets in Vermont. Though Hurricane Sandy made landfall in New Jersey, its affects were experienced across the Northeast. Hurricane Irene caused power outages for 6.69 million people and affected petroleum processing capacity of up to 238,000 barrels a day. Hurricane Sandy had an even greater effect on power distribution across New England, though not in Vermont. Hurricanes Sandy and Irene are among the costliest and deadliest storms in U.S. history, according to the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA, 2013). There is reason to believe that hurricanes of this magnitude will impact the Northeast and Vermont in the future.  4.2 Increased Lightning Strikes With an expected increase in frequency and intensity of major storm events, increased lighting activity is also highly probable. A subtle upward trend of lightning strikes has been observed in Vermont since 1986 (Chapter 1, Figure 4.6). Lightning is a well-known cause of power outages, Figure 4.5 compares the effects of Hurricane Irene and Hurricane Sandy on energy supply and transmission. From the report, \u201cComparing the Impacts of Northeast Hurricanes on Energy Infrastructure.\u201d  80 both due to direct strikes and indirect effects, often occurring when a tree limb falls on a power line.  The potential for disruption to the current energy supply associated with weather events is recognized in the Comprehensive Energy Plan and a major report entitled, \u201cEnergy Assurance Plan\u201d was completed in August 2013 by the Vermont Department of Public Service. This report covers the details of a state-level response to a major disruption in energy. This includes preparedness drills and a clear set of directives in the case of major events. The report also acknowledges the vulnerability of the state\u2019s systems. For instance, natural gas heats approximately 15% of Vermont\u2019s homes. None of this supply comes from within the state. The delivery of natural gas \u201cdepends on the [vulnerabilities of the] state transportation system, primarily flooding and wash-outs and snow and ice\u201d (Energy Assurance Plan, 2013). The same vulnerabilities exist for oil supplies, which heat 50% of homes in Vermont. In the report, Tropical Storm Irene is acknowledged as a difficult and valuable learning experience that exposed weakness in energy preparedness. The Energy Assurance Plan attempts to address those weaknesses and create systems that are well structured and resilient to major disruption.  5. Increased Energy Use due to Warming Temperatures  As winter temperatures increase, Vermont will use less fuel for heating and compared to other regions in the country and will see the second largest decrease in natural gas use for thermal energy production. However, summer temperatures will also increase and consumers will use more electricity for air conditioning. Thus, the net energy change in Vermont will increase over the coming decades. VELCO, the state\u2019s energy transmission company, projects an increase in electric energy use of .4% annually to 2030. A peak load increase in the summer, due to air conditioning is expected to be .7% annually to 2030 (Comprehensive Energy Plan, 2011). The image below displays an estimate of changes in \u201ccooling degree days\u201d and \u201cheating degree days\u201d. A cooling degree day is a day with an average temperature over 65 degrees, theoretically requiring air conditioning in buildings. A heating degree day is a day of temperatures under 65 degrees, when a heating system might be turned on in a building. Vermont will see an increase by 10, in cooling degree days from 2041-2070, explained in the chart below. Compared to Figure 4.5. Chittenden County, Vermont: Cloud to ground lightning strikes (Chapter 1, this report).  81 national averages, Vermont will not see the extreme temperature swings that will likely occur in other areas of the nation.   6. Mitigation \u2013 Energy Efficiency and Conservation 6.1 Electric The CEP clearly outlines the importance of increased efficiency and conservation efforts in meeting state energy use reduction goals. The creation of Efficiency Vermont in 2009, along with other efficiency programs, has contributed significantly to increased energy efficiency and since 2004, the state has reduced electric demand by an average of 2% annually. Overall energy demand increases have been near 0% for the past ten years. Vermont currently leads the nation in electric efficiency investments and calculations show that a year of investments in efficiency currently yields $5 to the state for every $1 spent. Nonetheless, efforts to improve insulation in homes, landed Vermont far behind the state\u2019s goal of insulating 8,200 home per year by 2020. Though 6,700 homes have been insulated since 2008, the pace must increase to meet the challenge of insulating the state\u2019s goal of a total of 80,000 homes by 2020 (Comprehensive Energy Plan, 2011).  6.2 Transportation Transportation is another area for increased energy conservation and efficiency. Due to the rural nature of the state, Vermonters drive most places and combustion of fossil fuels for transportation accounts for almost half of the state\u2019s overall energy use. Increasing the purchase and use of electric vehicles has been identified as a key strategy in reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with transportation. Along these lines, opportunities for strategic land use planning and personal decisions about where to buy a home could have an impact on driving Figure 4.6. Cooling degree days and heating degree days estimated for the Northeast are compared here to other regions of the country. According to this comparison, Vermont\u2019s overall energy use will increase but not dramatically, compared to other places. This is good news for Vermonters. (Melillo et al. 2014).  82 behavior. Overall, if Vermont is to meet the goals of 90% renewable energy by 2050, conservation and efficiency efforts must increase.   7. Behavior Change and Energy Use The field of Behavioral Science has increasingly attracted interest from energy and policy experts. Insights from behavioral studies offer tools to understand and incentivize behaviors related to energy efficiency and use. Critically, these insights can be applied in the area of policy and highlight leverage points for policy makers. Areas of research related to behavior change originate in the fields of marketing and consumer research, but more recently have been applied in the areas of health, education and energy. Britain\u2019s \u201cNudge Unit\u201d applies research from behavioral economics to address a plethora of policy challenges and is rapidly becoming a model for other policy institutions, including the U.S. Government (Bennhold, 2013). Several main streams of research and the implications for policy are covered below.  7.1 Informational Feedback A substantive body of research exists from the last four decades on the effect of informational feedback on consumer behavior. A review of various programs implementing the use of direct information feedback consistently finds energy savings ranging up to 20% for consumers Figure 4.7. The graphic displays an outline of how policies might interface with behavioral change mechanisms. Certain mechanisms will be more difficult to adopt than others \u2013 but, it\u2019s possible that changes with the most cumulative impact are relatively easy to implement.  83 monitoring their energy use. For example, In-Home Displays (IHDs) show consumers\u2019 their real-time energy use and show an average reduction of energy use around 10% (Darby, 2006). These instruments have shown to be powerful tools for increasing consumers\u2019 awareness of actions that contribute to energy use and conservation behaviors. In some instances, monitoring home energy use also caused a \u201cspillover\u201d effect into other decisions \u2013 like how much to drive or fly (Hargreaves, 2010). When pay-as-you-go systems for electricity consumption were included as part of the program, consumers were able to reduce energy consumption by an average of 15-20% (Darby 2006). The research is clear that informational feedback for customers leads to behavior changes that can reduce energy consumption.   7.2 Policy Connections to Informational Feedback The arrival of the Smart grid in Vermont will undoubtedly lead to more information for energy customers. However, the research shows that real-time energy information is the key to behavior change that equals energy conservation. According to Green Mountain Power\u2019s website, smart meter information on energy usage will be easily available on an internet webpage. In addition, smartphone apps are under development. Though the information accessible on a webpage will vastly increase the amount of information available to consumers, In-Home Displays, showing real time data, have been tested and demonstrated to reduce energy consumption. Combining the information available from smart meter technology with In-Home Displays would undoubtedly show significant results in energy reduction. A pilot study conducted in Texas, with Center Point Energy utility found that 71% of participants using IHDs displaying smart meter information on their energy use, engaged in action to reduce their energy consumption (Center Point Energy, 2011). Vermont could introduce legislation offering rebates for the purchase of IHDs or pass similar policies ensuring that energy use information is available to consumers on a consistent basis, in a useable manner. Box 4.1 NUDGING ENERGY EFFICIENCY Three years ago, Britain\u2019s Prime Minister, David Cameron, picked up the book, Nudge. This small book inspired a revolution in how Britain is addressing complex public policy problems; from unemployment and smoking, to paying taxes and insulating attics.  Britain\u2019s Behavioral Insights Team develops ideas and strategies designed to \u201cnudge\u201d citizens\u2019 decisions in the direction of pro-social behavior. By developing ideas and then testing them, the team has uncovered effective mechanisms for changing behavior in Britain. A recent achievement is the success of a program designed to increase residential attic insulations. After including a \u201cloft clearing\u201d service with the insulation process, participation in the program rose dramatically. The Behavioral Insights Team identified the hidden deterrent to attic insulation \u2013 residents didn\u2019t want to clear their attics! This insight ultimately led to dramatic energy savings. There\u2019s something we can learn here from the Brits.  84 7.3 Energy Conservation as a Societal \u201cNorm\u201d The creation of \u201csocial norms\u201d associated with environmental conservation and specifically energy conservation, is another well-studied arena. There is good evidence that consumers are influenced by similar members in a group, often very strongly. Particularly when individuals have similar personal characteristics with another person, they are likely to be influenced by that person\u2019s behaviors. A study of guests in hotel rooms found that people were more likely to engage in an \u201cenvironmental\u201d behavior when they learned that the guest who stayed in their hotel room previously engaged in that behavior \u2013 in this case, choosing to reuse towels instead of having them washed (Goldstein, 2008). Similarly, an extensive study of the energy conservation program, OPOWER, finds that consumers are consistently influenced by peers\u2019 energy use. An average energy reduction of 2% was found by sending letters to consumers with information about their neighbors\u2019 energy use (Allcot, 2010). This energy reduction is roughly equal to a 5 \u2013 11% price increase.  7.4 Policy Connections to Energy Conservation as a Societal Norm Currently, neither Green Mountain Power (GMP) nor Burlington Electric use the OPOWER program and do not compare other customers\u2019 energy use on energy bills. A conversation with a representative from GMP confirmed that the utility is aware of the program and has discussed implementation (Dorothy Schure, personal communication, Nov. 4, 2013). However, at the time of this writing, GMP has prioritized the smooth transition of Central Vermont Public Service Corporation\u2019s software systems, following the merger of the two companies. Encouraging the use of this relatively simple and cost effective tool for energy consumers is low-hanging fruit for policy makers. Extensive research has been conducted on the efficacy of the OPOWER program and makes a strong case for non-price interventions that can affect consumer behavior. The use of social norms could also be extended to other areas of energy use.  Box 4.2 Driving Demand: A Case Study   85   A major report titled, \u201cDriving Demand for Home Energy Improvements\u201d published in 2010 and funded by the Department of Energy, investigates behavioral change related to energy use in fourteen different case studies of utilities across the country. The focus in the case studies was understanding consumer decisions to upgrade homes for increased energy efficiency. The focus on the consumer \u2013 not economics or technology \u2013 is new in understanding energy efficiency and energy use in general, and can be informative for other behaviors.  The various projects associated with the report applied theories of behavioral change to program design and implementation. For instance, in Hood River, Oregon, a highly successful project to increase home energy efficiency (85% implementation of energy upgrades), used social network theory to design a marketing plan that analyzed the social connections within the Hood River community.  In analyzing the program, the program leaders discovered that the contractors installing the updates became initial ambassadors and had significant influence on how consumers viewed the products. If a problem existed with the initial installation of an upgrade, a contractor\u2019s mistake could influence perception and acceptance of the entire program. Other insights were gained from a year-long process of studying local attitudes towards issues connected to energy. For instance, Hood River residents dislike orders from outsiders, are concerned about fairness and are suspicious of things that are free.   These insights helped program directors design and implement a plan that was responsive to customers\u2019 concerns and capitalized on the unique attributes of the Hood River Community. The entire project, comprising fourteen programs, found themes connected to the adoption of new behaviors that increased energy efficiency in homes. A few of these themes are listed below.  \uf0d8 Programs must sell something that people want \u2013 most people are not emotionally connected to the idea of reducing energy use; people feel more connected to ideas of health, security and safety. Reducing energy use or purchasing an electric car must be connected to values that resonate with customers. \uf0d8 Target the population and spend the necessary time and money to understand that population. Not all consumers are the same \u2013 understanding the values and characteristics of the target populations will greatly increase the likelihood of developing a campaign that resonates. \uf0d8 Framing is important. In these studies, words like \u201caudit\u201d and \u201cretrofit\u201d did little to help people understand the issues and framed things negatively. Words that tap into existing mental models are more useful. Framing in terms of community can help customers see the broader value of reducing energy use or supporting renewable energy. \uf0d8 Most consumers need to hear a message at least three times before adoption. An effective marketing campaign will include various methods for connecting to potential customers. Figure 4.8. The Hood River Conservation Project logo was influenced by the orchards in River, a point of regional pride  86 Although this study focuses on energy efficiency upgrades, many of the lessons learned can be extended to other energy issues like electric car campaigns and the adoption of renewable energy technology.

According to this theory, the way in which trends or innovations \u201ctake-off\u201d in a society (or don\u2019t) depends upon several key factors. Most important, is the ability of an innovation to \u201cbe reinvented\u201d through modifications by users. A key question is: How well does the innovation evolve to meet the needs of more people? Everett Rogers, the preeminent scholar in this field divides people into five categories that determine how quickly they pick up a new idea or technology and thus, whether or not it will survive. The five different segments of the population are; innovators \u2013 who pick up ideas quickly, early adopters \u2013 who are often financially secure and comfortable with risk, early and late majority \u2013 this represents most people in society and they are cost- sensitive and risk-averse, and laggards \u2013 they see high risk in adopting a new idea and are usually last on board, if at all. Understanding these five groups allows a marketer or firm to focus their efforts. This last point is critical. In moving the population towards increased energy efficiency and conservation, the efforts must be focused and strategic (Rogers, 1962). Depending upon the stage of \u201cdiffusion\u201d for a specific idea or technology, a marketer\u2019s approach will vary. For instance in the early stages of adoption, media and advertising play an important role, while in the later stages of an adoption, conversations with peers are very important.  In a study exploring consumer motivations for the purchase of hybrid vehicles, experimenters used \u2018diffusion of innovation\u2019 theory (along with several other behavioral theories) to understand why people buy hybrid vehicles and how to encourage this behavior. In general, the study showed that the adoption of \u201cgreen\u201d technologies is a social process (Ozaki et. al, 2009). This process can be described in five stages. Everett Rogers identifies these stages as: acquiring information about the technology through social networks, forming and attitude towards it; deciding to adopt the technology or not implementing it and confirming or maintaining the decision. The second stage, \u201cforming an attitude\u201d is of specific importance. This is when an innovation will either be embraced or discarded by consumers \u2013 and this all depends on how the innovation is viewed. In the case of hybrid vehicle purchase, consumers identified financial benefits and environmental benefits as central to their decision to buy a hybrid, and \u201cadopt\u201d the innovation. Upon investigation, the authors of the study found that the importance of financial benefits trumped environmental benefits (though environmental benefits were important and related to social norms and a desire to be perceived as environmental). The decision to purchase (or adopt) a new innovation like hybrid vehicles or electric cars is multi-faceted and complex. Understanding the social processes of adopting new energy efficiency and conservation technologies is critical to their ultimate success.   87 7.6 Policy Connections to Diffusion of Innovation In the study mentioned above, financial incentives were the most important factor in consumers\u2019 decisions to purchase hybrid vehicles in the United Kingdom. The financial benefits highlighted most by survey respondents related to lower gasoline costs, lower road taxes, accessibility to town centers and priority or free parking. This shows that policy makers have an important role to play in the adoption of new technologies. Hybrid vehicles were determined to be highly beneficial to consumers who purchased them, due in large part to financial benefits created by policy mechanisms. The study also shows that the perception of an innovation as \u201cenvironmental\u201d can have a large impact on its adoption, particularly when there\u2019s social pressure to make environmental decisions. Thus, it\u2019s important for industry and government to help to craft the discourse around the adoption of new, energy efficient technologies, like electric cars in Vermont.  7.7 Stages of Change Model, Theory of Reasoned Action and the Theory of Planned Behavior  Stages of Change behavioral theory refers to individual choices and factors that move a consumer to adopt a new behavior. This model has been applied most often to behavior changes related to health, like diet changes or the cessation of smoking. Scholars identify four main stages in a fundamental behavior change:   1. Pre-change behavior (like contemplation of a change) 2. Preparation 3. Action  4. Post-change stages (like maintenance or relapse) This relates closely to the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA), which states that the most important element of a major behavior change is the intention. The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), focuses on consumers\u2019 beliefs and attitudes towards certain behaviors and the eventual adoption of behaviors. TPB asserts that intentions do not always translate to behavior.  7.8 Policy Connections to Stages of Change Model, Theory of Reasoned Action and the Theory of Planned Behavior A recent study on the process of quitting smoking, might lend itself to understanding how major behaviors take shape and where policy might intervene in promoting energy efficiency and conservation (Deir et. al 2011). An examination of study participants in various stages of smoking addiction (smokers, trying to quit, never smokers), found that the most success from interventions was in educating and supporting the \u201cnever smokers\u201d. Individuals at various other  88 stages of change had higher relapse percentages than those already at the \u201cmaintenance\u201d stage of smoking. That is, the \u201cnever smokers\u201d had reached \u201csuccess\u201d defined by the maintenance stage. By educating this population, it is possible to influence their continued behaviors and may garner the most benefits to individual and societal health for the least amount of resources. Connections to energy policy emphasize again, the importance of targeting an audience with educational efforts and messaging. Stages of Change, the Theory of Planned Behaviors and Theory of Reasoned Action help to identify different stages towards adopting an action and offer insight into the complexity of behavior. These theories also emphasize the importance of education for young consumers who will grow to be influential decision makers and will also create social norms. Energy education in schools should be a part of public policy efforts.  8. Summary Table Rating Quality of Information  Key Message 1 Energy efficiency and conservation are key components of Vermont\u2019s goal of 90% renewable energy sources by 2050. Understanding mechanisms that can increase energy efficiency and conservation behaviors are central to this challenge. Policy decisions that leverage an understanding of behavior change could profoundly support this mitigation effort. Description of evidence base Goldstein, N., Cialdini, R., Griskevicius, V., (2008).

Underwood1 1 Civil and Environmental Engineering, College of Engineering and Mathematical Sciences, University of Vermont  Key Messages \uf0b7 As average annual rainfall has increased in recent decades, average annual flows in Vermont rivers have increased. Based on climate model projections for increased precipitation, average annual streamflows can be expected to continue increasing in coming decades.   \uf0b7 Warming temperatures are leading to earlier thaw dates on Vermont rivers, lakes and ponds as well as earlier thaw dates for snowpack in the mountains.  Earlier thaw dates and changing precipitation patterns have caused streamflows to shift seasonally.   Average monthly flows in January and March, as well as July, August, and October through December, have increased while average monthly flows in April and May have decreased.   \uf0b7 High flows are larger in magnitude and are occurring more frequently, often in the winter months associated with earlier thaw dates for snowpack.  In the coming decades, climate models project that a greater fraction of winter precipitation will fall as rain or freezing rain rather than snow, leading to rain-on-snow events and rain on frozen ground, with associated flooding.  Up to an 80% increase in the probability of high flows is projected under assumptions of high green-house-gas emissions by the end of the century. \uf0b7 Warming temperatures and an expected increase in seasonal variability of rainfall and runoff may increase the potential for summer dry spells by century\u2019s end.  Evidence suggests that Vermont rivers have sustained higher base flows during summer months over recent decades, in contrast to other parts of New England (coastal Maine) and the US. However, climate projections indicate an increased potential for dry spells in summer months by the end of the century, which could lead to extended periods of very low stream and lake levels and reduced recharge to groundwater.   \uf0b7 Changing rainfall, runoff and temperature patterns will affect availability and reliability of water resources to a variety of Vermont sectors (e.g., agriculture, communities, tourism, energy) in complex ways.  95 1. Water Resources of Vermont Water resources of Vermont comprise both surface water and groundwater.   Vermont surface waters include approximately 24,500 miles of rivers and streams3; 824 lakes, reservoirs and ponds; and more than 290,000 acres of wetlands4.   Surface waters of the state drain to one of four major basins: Lake Champlain to the north and west, Lake Memphremagog to the northeast, the Hudson River to the southwest and the Connecticut River to the east and southeast.  Surface waters are managed for multiple uses including:  support to aquatic organisms and wildlife, drinking water, swimming, boating, fishing, snow-making, agriculture (irrigation and livestock), flood control, and industrial processes including cooling a nuclear power plant. Groundwater is stored below the ground surface in soils, in spaces between sand and gravel particles, and in fractures or other partings of the bedrock.  Nearly 70% percent of Vermont\u2019s population5 depends on groundwater for their drinking water supply. Groundwater is also used for agriculture (livestock), commercial developments, mining, and manufacturing.  Groundwater returns flow to lakes, ponds, and wetlands, and thereby sustains our multi-varied uses of surface water and supports aquatic habitats. This Water Chapter of the Vermont Climate Assessment addresses how climate change will affect our water resources.  Key messages are provided below, along with supporting evidence for observed historic trends and projected future trends.  This chapter discusses likely or potential impacts to our natural and built systems as a result of water-related climate-change impacts.  Also presented are opportunities to build greater resilience in the face of climate change.  2. Greater Runoff and Annual Streamflows As average annual rainfall has increased in recent decades (see Chapter 1), average annual flows in Vermont rivers have increased.  Based on climate model projections for increased precipitation, average annual streamflows can be expected to continue increasing in coming decades. In any given rain event, the fraction of rain and snow-melt that runs off the land surface to rivers, streams, lakes and wetlands - versus that fraction that soaks into the soil and is available for use by vegetation and recharge to underlying stores of groundwater - is a complex function of topography, geology, land cover/use and pre-existing soil moisture conditions.  Mountainous regions of Vermont receive greater amounts of rain and snow than the lowlands.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from a low of 32 inches per year in the Champlain Valley, to 36 inches per year in the Connecticut River valley, to over 50 inches per year along the north-south trending spine of the Green Mountains (Randall, 1996).  High relief in the mountains, as well as the predominance of low-permeability glacial till and shallow bedrock leads to more rapid runoff from rain and snowmelt.  Headwater channels are steep and often confined closely by valley walls, and flows can be flashy in nature.  In contrast, the lowlands are generally lower in gradient                                                           3 National Hydrography Dataset, 1:5000 scale 4 VT  2012 Water Quality Integrated Assessment Report, http://www.vtwaterquality.org/mapp/docs/305b/mp_305b-2012.pdf 5 Vermont population: 625,741 (2010 census)  96 and characterized by thicker deposits of sediments overlying bedrock.  Floodplains are typically wider and there are more wetlands, lakes and ponds to provide for storage and attenuation of storm flows.   Mean annual runoff ranges from more than 35 inches per year along the spine of the Green Mountains to less than 12 inches per year in the Champlain Valley (Randall, 1996).  On a regional and local basis, land cover will influence the magnitude and intensity of runoff.  For example, developed lands are typically characterized by pavement, roads, roof tops and other impervious surfaces that tend to block infiltration of rainwater and snowmelt, leading to more runoff.  In contrast, naturally forested lands tend to be characterized by tree canopies, understory vegetation and well-developed soils that promote interception and re-evaporation by canopies, and greater infiltration of rainfall and snowmelt.  Runoff from forested lands is generally much lower in volume and intensity than runoff from developed lands. 1.1 Historic trends A network of river gages has been established across the nation by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to continuously measure streamflow in select rivers.  A subset of USGS streamflow gages has been selected to track impacts of climate change on river flows (Slack and Landwehr, 1992).   Rivers in this Hydro-Climatic Data Network (HCDN) network were selected because they have available a relatively long streamflow gaging record, and because they drain watersheds that have been minimally impacted by impoundments, channel diversion or other changes in land use that might significantly influence streamflow over the period of record.  Several of these rivers are located in New England, and have been evaluated for trends attributed to effects of climate change.  Average annual flows in these New England rivers have increased over the past half century (Hodgkins & Dudley, 2005; Huntington et al., 2009).   Similar increasing trends in average yearly flows are apparent for eleven Vermont rivers (Figure 5.1).  While not all of these rivers are officially a part of the USGS Hydro-Climatic Data Network, they have been reviewed and determined to be minimally influenced by flow regulations (dams, diversions) or land use changes (Guilbert & Underwood, 2013; Hodgkins et al., 2010).   According to USGS State Water-Data Reports, there have been times, either historically or at present, when eight of the eleven gages have exhibited an infrequent or occasional diurnal (daily) signal during low-flow conditions as a result of a distant upstream mill dam(s) or power dam(s).  However, these conditions do not constitute a significant flow regulation in the upstream watershed capable of affecting the use of these gages to evaluate long-term trends in streamflow (Hodgkins et al., 2010; Hodgkins & Dudley, 2011). 1.2 Projected Trends Under high-emission modeling scenarios, surface runoff is projected to increase by 3.6 inches per year by mid-century and by 6.5 in./yr. by end-of-century (Huntington et al., 2007).  With these expected increases in surface runoff, climate models project continued increases in average annual streamflow by the end of the 21st century.    97   Figure 5.1.  Historic trends in mean annual flows for select Vermont rivers. Positive trend (upward arrow) indicates increased discharge.  Trend is statistically significant (p<0.05; Mann-Kendall) for all eleven rivers.(Guilbert & Underwood, 2013, unpublished data; after Hodgkins et al., 2010)  98  1.3 Impacts Generally, greater amounts of rainfall will mean greater amounts of stormwater runoff to receiving channels.  In developed areas, rainfall and snowmelt will quickly run off impervious surfaces to the nearest swale or stream.  To the extent that stormwater runoff is not controlled or managed through treatments prescribed by state or local regulations, runoff diverted overland in this way will have higher velocities and therefore an increased capability to erode sediment and debris from the land surface.  Concentrated runoff will lead to increased gullying, and erosion of sediments from the land surface, roads, ditches and streambanks.  In addition to sediment, there will be an increased potential for delivery of nutrients, pathogens and toxins to Vermont rivers and lakes.  Collectively, these diffuse sources of pollution are termed nonpoint source pollution.  Based on more than twenty years of monitoring river contributions to Lake Champlain, nonpoint source pollutants increase substantially as streamflow volumes rise (LCBP, 2012; Stager & Thill, 2010; Medalie &  Sullivan et al., 2009; Smeltzer & Simoneau, 2008). Spring flooding during 2011 mobilized significant volumes of sediment and nutrients to Lake Champlain (LCBP, 2012).    In rivers, excess nutrients and sediments can lead to enhanced algae production and other changes in water quality (e.g., siltation) that reduce the channel\u2019s capacity to support macroinvertebrates, fish, freshwater mussels, and other aquatic organisms.  In receiving lakes, excess nutrients and warmer water temperatures can lead to more frequent blooms of blue-green algae which represent a potential threat to human and animal health (Figure 5.2).  These changes also have the potential to impact aesthetics and recreational uses of our waterways.   Figure 5.2.  Blue-green algae bloom on Lake Champlain looking south from Missisquoi Bay Bridge.  Photo credit:  Lake Champlain Basin Program.  99  Greater amounts of annual precipitation will likely lead to increases in average annual lake levels.  Stager & Thill (2010) note that \u201cif annual precipitation increases 4\u20136 inches by the end of this century as most models suggest under [a high-GHG-emission] scenario, and if the relationship between precipitation and surface levels still follows its current pattern, then Lake Champlain could stand as much as 1-2 feet higher, on average, by 2100\u201d.  The projected variability in precipitation (higher highs and lower lows) may lead to a \u201cwider range of lake level fluctuations over the course of the year\u201d (Stager & Thill, 2010).  Rising lake levels may increase or decrease the shallow lake-edge habitats, depending upon the local topography and the presence of infrastructure (e.g., roads that may constrain lake levels). On forest lands, accelerated runoff (increased flow peaks and magnitudes) as well as sediment loading can result if networks of logging access roads, skidder trails, and logging landings are poorly-managed where these features intersect with the stream network (Wemple et al., 1996). Where stormwater is not well managed on farms, increased runoff may result in increased mobilization of sediment, pathogens, and nutrients from concentrated feeding operations, barnyards, and manure or sileage storage areas.  Streambank erosion can be accelerated in locations where naturally-vegetated riparian buffers have been removed to facilitate cultivation, livestock pasturing, or development.    Substantial volumes of sediment (often nutrient-laden) erode from ditches and enter surface waters where road and driveway networks intersect the stream network.  These effects are particularly significant during intense rains or flood events (Figure 5.3).  Wastewater treatment facilities that are not completely disconnected from storm sewers may become overwhelmed by stormwater volumes, allowing for the possibility of increased contamination to receiving lakes or rivers (US EPA, 2008). 1.4 Opportunities to Build Resilience  Several mitigation and adaptation strategies are possible to address the likelihood for greater runoff and increased average annual streamflows in the coming century.  \uf0a7 Restore wetlands and protect river corridors to enhance the flow and sediment attenuation role of the riparian areas Figure 5.3.  Washout on North Road, Middletown Springs, VT during Tropical Storm Irene (28 August 2011).

Forest management practices that maximize infiltration of rainfall and runoff will reduce peak flows from the headwaters and minimize runoff of sediment and nutrients to rivers, lakes and wetlands.  \uf0a7 Improve compliance with Acceptable Agricultural Practices (AAPs)7 on agriculture lands.  Manage nutrient applications so that phosphorus and nitrogen are not applied at rates that exceed the agronomic needs of the soil (regular soil testing, nutrient management planning).  \uf0a7 Exclude livestock from rivers and streams and re-establish naturally-vegetated buffers.   Direct access to the stream by livestock can contribute to soil loss and enhanced mobilization of phosphorus, E.coli and other pathogens as river flows increase and inundation becomes more likely.    \uf0a7 Adhere to existing stormwater regulations.  Implement enhanced stormwater ordinances at the municipal level to provide more stringent controls on stormwater runoff for development projects that fall under the thresholds which trigger implementation of stormwater management practices (i.e., Act 250 review, Stormwater Management Rule).  \uf0a7 Separate stormwater and sewer treatment systems.    \uf0a7 Improve management of stormwater runoff and reduce erosion along road ditches and at culvert outlets.  Road maintenance practices to mitigate for stormwater and sediment runoff may include: stabilization of road surfaces (different gravel materials), improvement of roadside ditches (excavation, stone lining and/or seeding and mulching), alternative grading practices (turnouts, check-basins); re-orientation of culvert crossings; protection of culvert headers; and gully stabilization.                                                            6 VT Dept of Forests, Parks & Recreation (2009), http://www.vtfpr.org/watershed/documents/Amp2009pdf.pdf 7 VT Agency of Agriculture (2006),  http://www.vermontagriculture.com/ARMES/awq/AAPs.htm   101  2. Earlier Thaw Dates and Seasonal Shift in Streamflows Warming temperatures are leading to earlier thaw dates on Vermont rivers, lakes and ponds as well as earlier thaw dates for snowpack in the mountains.  Earlier thaw dates and changing precipitation patterns have caused streamflows to shift seasonally.   Average monthly flows in January and March, as well as July, August, and October through December, have increased while average monthly flows in April and May have decreased.   A majority of the total annual flow in Vermont rivers occurs from ice-out to late spring in a typical year (Shanley & Denner, 1999; Hodgkins & Dudley, 2011).  This phenomenon is due to the occurrence of spring rains falling on saturated or frozen ground (accelerating runoff), melting of the snow pack stored in higher elevations, and low evapotranspiration rates prior to leafing of deciduous vegetation in the cool spring temperatures.  Streamflows typically decline from May through September, as snowmelt ends, vegetation leafs out and evapotranspiration rates increase with heating through the summer months.  River levels reach their lowest level in August or September, except when influenced by rains from a summer thunder storm or tropical system.  River levels rebound somewhat in the fall with decreasing evapotranspiration rates as temperatures decline, leaves drop, and vegetation enters dormancy.  Fall rains are common and can saturate soils, leading to increased runoff and higher river levels. It is common for tropical storms or hurricanes to result in high peak flows during fall months. Winter flows are generally low, since precipitation falls as snow and accumulates on the land surface as a result of below-freezing temperatures.  Ice forms on lakes and ponds and over slower-moving water in rivers, until warming temperatures bring spring thaws and the cycle begins again.  Since climate changes will affect temperature and rainfall patterns as well as evaporation cycles in complex ways, flows in Vermont rivers are expected to shift seasonally.  In winter months, a greater proportion of precipitation is expected to fall as rain or freezing rain rather than snow, since winter temperatures are rising (0.9\u00b0F per decade) twice as fast as summer temperatures (0.4\u00b0F per decade) based on records from 1960 through 2010 (Betts, 2011b).  Warmer winters will lead to reduced accumulation of snow during some years.  Less snowpack may mean less runoff during the late winter/early spring thaw. This effect may be offset by increased rains falling on frozen ground, leading to greater runoff. However, if winter temperatures rise to levels that decrease the duration of frost conditions by late in the century, runoff may be moderated by increases in soil infiltration \u2013 as long as soils do not become saturated by a rain event.  2.1 Historic Trends Length of the frozen condition on Vermont lakes is decreasing by seven days per decade, as freeze-up has occurred four days later per decade and ice-out has occurred three days earlier per decade based on records from 1970 through 2010 (Figure 5.4) (Betts, 2011b).   102   The effects of earlier snowmelt on streamflow have been demonstrated by Hodgkins et al. (2003) for several New England rivers in the HCDN.  To evaluate for a potential shift in the distribution of flows through the seasons, they calculated the center-of-volume (COV) date for the winter/spring season (January 1 to May 31) in each year. A COV date represents the day on which one half of a river\u2019s total flow volume for a given time period of analysis passes by the gaging station. Hodgkins et al. (2003) found that the winter/spring COV of streamflow has shifted to earlier dates over the last three-quarters of the 20th century.  From 1971 through 2000, the winter/spring COV date has come earlier by 1 to 2 weeks in those watersheds particularly influenced by melting snowpack. These shifting winter/spring COV dates were correlated to rising March and April air temperatures and increasing January precipitation. In a related study, Hodgkins and Dudley (2006) found  significant increases in monthly average streamflow for New England rivers in the months of January, February and March over a period of record from 1953 to 2002, whereas May average runoff decreased at a number of stations over the same time period.   Figure 5.5 depicts COV trends recently calculated for eleven Vermont rivers, each of which are at sufficient elevation and latitude as to be particularly affected by snowmelt. Four of the eleven gaging stations demonstrated statistically significant decreasing trends in the winter/spring COV date. If trends in these four gages are examined more closely over equal lengths of record from 1959 through 2012, they indicate that the winter/spring COV date has come earlier by approximately 10 days (Figure 5.6). The other HCDN and non-HCDN gages also exhibited a decreasing trend in winter/spring COV, though not statistically significant.  Figure 5.4.  Historic ice-out and freeze-up trends on select Vermont ponds, 1970 to 2010.   Excerpted with permission, from Betts, 2011b.  103   Figure 5.5. Historic trends in winter/ spring Center of Volume dates for select Vermont rivers.  A negative trend (down arrow) indicates the COV date is moving earlier in the year. Trend is statistically significant (p<0.05; Mann-Kendall) for four of the eleven rivers.   (Guilbert & Underwood, 2013, unpublished data; after Hodgkins et al., 2010).  104   While flows in the latter half of the year represent a relatively small percentage of the total annual flow, seasonal shifts in precipitation are expected to result in increased streamflows in late summer and fall months.  Based on recorded streamflows from eleven Vermont rivers (with record lengths ranging from 54 to 96 years through water year 2012), average flows in the late summer, fall, and winter months have increased.   At least 9 out of 11 gages showed statistically significant (p<0.05, Mann-Kendall in all but one case that was p<0.10) increases in mean monthly discharge for the months of July, August, October, November, December, January and March (Guilbert & Underwood, 2013; unpublished data)  Similar results were suggested by an analysis of flows at six gaging stations in the Winooski River basin.  Hackett (2009) found that monthly average discharge increased in August, October, November and December for the period from 1937 through 2005.  These streamflow trends were correlated with increasing precipitation trends recorded for the same period.   2.2 Projected Trends Figure 5.6.  Winter/Spring Center of Volume (Jan 1 through May 31) dates for years 1959 through 2012 for four Vermont HCDN gages for which a decreasing trend was statistically significant (p<0.05, Mann-Kendall).  Remaining seven of eleven gages selected for analysis had similar decreasing trends that were not statistically significant.  105  Climate projections for the Lake Champlain Basin indicate that the number of freezing days per year will decrease \u201cfrom an average of 116.5 days during the base period [1970-1999] to 85.2 days by midcentury [2040-2069] and 71.7 days by late century [2070-2099].\u201d (Guilbert et al., 2013).  On average, the number of days in winter (December, January, and February) with snow coverage is projected to decrease by 5 days by 2100 in the Northeast (Hayhoe, et al 2007).   Based on climate models (and assuming high emission scenarios), Hayhoe et al. (2007) project a \u201ctendency toward more streamflow in winter and spring, and less in summer and fall\u201d for rivers of the Northeast, particular in northern latitudes where snowmelt has a strong influence on river levels in winter and spring months.  Peak spring streamflows are projected to occur 5 to 8 days earlier by the middle of the century and 10 to 15 days earlier by century\u2019s end (Hayhoe et al., 2007).  This phenomenon is related to earlier thaw dates driven by warming winter temperatures.  Variability in streamflow throughout the year will also increase; there will be higher, high flows and lower, low flows in the mix.  A 40 to 70% increase in the probability of high flows is projected under assumptions of high GHG emissions (Hayhoe, et al., 2007) (Emissions scenarios are addressed in Chapter 1).   2.3 Impacts Impacts of earlier winter thaw dates on the hydrologic cycle are difficult to predict and will be highly variable.  In a typical year, the melting of snowpack in the Vermont mountains is a gradual process, and meltwaters are available to recharge groundwater, wetlands, lakes and reservoirs.  Groundwater is then available to sustain base flows in our rivers during the later summer months.  If climate change brings a thinner snowpack and reduced duration of snow cover in the winter months, it is possible that frost will penetrate deeper and persist for longer average durations with the absence of the insulating effect of snow cover.  Presence of frost limits infiltration and, along with more rapid melting of the snowpack driven by warmer temperatures and increased frequency of rain-on-snow events, can be expected to increase volumes of runoff (Shanley & Chalmers, 1999).  With this accelerated runoff to streams, it is possible that recharge to groundwater will be reduced.  If less groundwater is available to sustain baseflow conditions in Vermont rivers, these conditions may contribute to a longer duration of summer dry periods.   On the other hand, eventual warmer winter temperatures by century\u2019s end and reduced duration of frost may encourage infiltration of rain and snowmelt where presence of frost deep in the soil would ordinarily have limited infiltration. As streamflows are projected to increase and shift seasonally, we may see changes in the distribution, composition, and suitability of instream habitats that affect the health and survival of fish and other aquatic organisms.  Changing flow patterns may be especially impactful to species whose life cycles are dependent on the timing of spring flows, such as spring-spawning fish (Rustad et al., 2012). On Vermont rivers, the earlier timing of ice-out, combined with an expected shift to earlier and high-magnitude winter flows, may result in earlier timing of ice-jams (Figure 5.7) and associated  106  flooding (Prowse & Beltaos, 2002).  The location and magnitude of ice jam floods is difficult to predict.  Flooding effects are localized and lead to sudden erosion and inundation in \u201cbreak-out\u201d events.   Ice jam flooding can scour the channel margins impacting riparian vegetation and habitats, as well as affecting the dynamics of nutrient and organic matter cycles.  On the other hand, localized outburst flood events caused by ice jams may introduce sediment, nutrients and organic matter into disconnected floodplain environments, thereby benefitting some riparian species (Huntington et al., 2009). Earlier thaw dates on lakes and ponds could influence the timing of seasonal turnover and duration of intervening thermal stratification in deeper water bodies such as Lake Champlain.  Turnover is a process of lake mixing that is driven by seasonal (fall and spring) temperature changes.  Between mixing events, deeper lakes become thermally stratified with the cooler, denser water sinking to the bottom and warmer, less dense water at the surface.   If spring mixing occurs earlier in the year, as a result of earlier ice-out, and there is a prolonged period of summer stratification, there could be a potential for enhanced oxygen depletion by late summer in the deepest parts of the lake.  These hypoxic conditions could reduce phytoplankton abundance and impact other organisms that depend on phytoplankton as a food source (Stager & Thill, 2010). Earlier thaw dates and seasonal shifts in streamflow may also impact the built environment.  Given a legacy of development in narrow river valleys, Vermont communities will be susceptible to ice-jam flooding which can scour streambanks and damage adjacent roads, bridges, culverts and other structures in the floodplain.  Freeze/thaw variability will increase damage to roads and other building materials.  Community and domestic water supplies may be increasingly at risk near the end of the century, where replenishment of groundwater and reservoirs/ lakes is reduced as a result of reduced snowpack (and drier summer conditions).   There may be an increased likelihood of groundwater well interference in more densely populated areas.    2.4 Opportunities to Build Resilience  \uf0b7 Avoid placing new infrastructure in high-risk ice-jam flood areas. Figure 5.7.  Ice jam on the Lewis Creek in Charlotte floods the Lewis Creek Road and Spear Street Extension and adjacent residence during a January 2010 thaw.  Photo credit: Kristen Underwood  107  \uf0b7 Consider relocating infrastructure out of the floodplain. \uf0b7 Where roads and infrastructure cannot reasonably be relocated outside of high-hazard areas, seek opportunities to restore flood plains upstream of developed areas, to shed ice and attenuate flood peaks.   \uf0b7 Design roads to be periodically overtopped by ice and flood waters, with appropriate emergency management plans in place to control traffic and ensure public safety during these flood events.  3.  Flooding Projected to Intensify  High flows are larger in magnitude and are occurring more frequently, often in the winter months associated with earlier thaw dates for snowpack.  In the coming decades, climate models project that a greater fraction of winter precipitation will fall as rain or freezing rain rather than snow, leading to rain-on-snow events and rain on frozen ground, with associated flooding.  Up to an 80% increase in the probability of high flows is projected under assumptions of high green-house-gas emissions by the end of the century. While up to one half of the total annual flow for Vermont rivers typically occurs between ice out and mid-May (Shanley & Denner, 1999), individual storm events can account for between 5 and 15 % of the total annual flow.  Often the peak storm in a given water year is coincident with snowmelt in the late winter or early spring, but (more rarely) the peak annual event can also occur during a summer thunderstorm, or a late fall hurricane, for example.     3.1 Historic Trends Records for rivers in New England, including Vermont rivers in particular, indicate a rise in the magnitude of the annual peak discharge over the last several decades (Hodgkins & Dudley, 2005; Collins, 2009; Huntington et al., 2009).  This finding is consistent with an observed increase in high-intensity and high-magnitude precipitation events in New England for a similar time frame (Karl & Knight, 1998; Groisman, et al., 2001).   Average annual precipitation in the Northeastern United States has increased approximately 3.3 inches over the 100-year period from 1900 to 2000 (UNH Climate Change Research Center, 2005).  The frequency and number of intense precipitation events (defined as more than two inches of rain in a 48-hour period) has also increased, particularly in the last quarter of the 19th century (UNH Climate Change Research Center, 2005).  This finding is notable, considering that forest cover has been regenerating across much of the New England region over this time period (Foster et al., 1998; Thompson & Sorenson, 2002) \u2013 a change that would be expected to moderate flood peaks through effects of increased interception, infiltration and evapotranspiration.     108  This increasing trend in peak streamflows becomes more pronounced after 1970 (Collins, 2009; McCabe & Wolock, 2002).  The number of days per year with sustained high flows also appears to be increasing in some Vermont rivers (Figure 5.8). 3.2 Projected Trends Climate projections suggest that, in winter months, a greater proportion of  precipitation is expected to fall as rain or freezing rain rather than snow, leading to rain-on-snow events and rain on frozen ground (Frumhoff  et al., 2007).  The date of peak spring flow is projected to move earlier in the year as temperatures rise, advancing by more than 10 days by the end of the century (Frumhoff  et al., 2007). A 40 to 80% increase in the probability of high flows is projected under assumptions of high GHG emissions (Hayhoe et al., 2007; Frumhoff et al., 2007).   Figure 5.8.  Historic trend in frequency of occurrence of high-flow events at the  USGS gage on the Mad River in Moretown, VT.  (p<0.05; Mann-Kendall) Figure 5.9.  Impacts of flooding on Lake Champlain, Spring 2011. (A) Lake Champlain exceeded the historic flood stage of record from April through June of 2011 as a result of heavy spring rains which fell on record snow packs.  Historically, water levels in Lake Champlain have ranged from a low of 92.6 to 101.9 feet (USGS, 2009).  A new record flood stage of 103.2 ft was established on May 6, 2011. (B) Flooding impacted shoreline properties around the lake resulting in Federal disaster declarations for Vermont (and New York) counties.  109  3.3 Impacts Expected increases in the intensity and amount of precipitation (Frumhoff et al., 2007), paired with warmer temperatures, will mean that flooding will intensify along Vermont\u2019s river valleys and shorelines.   The flood events of the last 20 years including spring flooding of 2011 and the catastrophic Tropical Storm Irene in August of 2011 are harbingers of things to come (Figures 5.9 and 5.10).  Historically, agricultural and developed land uses have modified the Vermont landscape in ways that reduce flood resiliency.  Pavement, rooftops and other impervious surfaces, speed runoff to receiving waters.  Vegetation has been removed that might otherwise offer an attenuation of floodwaters.  Wetlands have been converted to ditched, cultivated fields (with an associated loss of microtopography).  Road and driveway networks and associated ditches intersect the stream network in multiple locations, delivering stormwater, sediment and debris.   Communities have been established along river banks and shore lines.  Floodplains functions have been constrained by the construction of buildings, roads and other infrastructure.  Streams and rivers have been ditched, channelized, straightened, bermed and armored and in many locations are now disconnected from their floodplains (Kline & Cahoon, 2010).    3.3.1 Water Quality On the one hand, greater water volumes may offer greater assimilative capacity for some point sources of pollutants, such as wastewater treatment effluent, a failing septic system or illicit discharge.  By and large, however, more frequent and intense floods will generate more nonpoint sources of pollutants, including sediment, pathogens, toxins and nutrients (Figure 5.11).   Higher lake levels induced by flooding will lead to greater shoreline erosion from wave action.  Aging or non-maintained septic systems in close proximity to lake edges can be a source of nutrient loading and pathogens. Figure 5.10. During Tropical Storm Irene (August 28-29, 2011) more than 500 miles of state roads and 200 bridges were damaged.  Town transportation infrastructure was also heavily damaged, including more than 2800 road segments, 280 bridges, and 960 culverts (Pealer, 2012).  Map used with permission, G. Springston, Norwich University.   110  Excess sediment production can result from channel reaches that are undergoing active adjustment in response to a history of manipulation, sediment and/or flow alterations \u2013 this condition will be exacerbated by flooding events.  Eroding streambanks have also been identified as a contributing nonpoint source of phosphorus in rivers and streams of Vermont where there is a legacy of phosphorus in floodplain soils (Langendoen et al., 2012; DeWolfe et al., 2004).  Increased turbidity from streambank erosion and overland delivery of sediments during flooding will also impact aesthetics and recreational uses of our lakes, ponds and reservoirs (Figure 5.12).   Figure 5.12 .  Lake Rescue, Ludlow, VT; view to south; September 2011. Following Tropical Storm Irene (August 2011), turbidity persisted for several months in Lake Rescue and other instream lakes along the upper Black River in Windsor County.

Figure 5.13. Route 4 washout along Mendon Brook, Mendon, Vermont.

A river in dynamic equilibrium, connected to its floodplain, with a naturally-vegetated corridor can provide many important ecosystem services for our natural and built communities, namely: o Attenuation of flows to reduce the peak and intensity of downstream floods; o Sediment storage, in river meanders, the floodplain, and in riparian wetlands and flood chutes; o Attenuation, transformation, and uptake of nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrates in riparian wetlands and the floodplain; o Improved diversity of channel bedforms and riparian landforms (pools, riffles, eddies, connected wetlands) which help to regulate water temperatures and provide habitat and refuge areas for riparian and aquatic species;  o Improved filtering and treatment of particulates and contaminants contained in storm flows; and  o Increased recharge to groundwater (which in turn increases base flows of the river during drought conditions).    \uf0a7 Restore naturally vegetated buffers along rivers, lakes and wetlands. \uf0a7 Restore channel-contiguous wetlands for their flood/sediment/nutrient attenuation functions (Callout box: Otter Creek)  3.4.2 Agriculture  \uf0a7 Implement changes in cropping practices to reduce concentrated runoff (and fine sediment and nutrient loading) to drainage ditches, road ditches, surface swales, inundation areas, wetlands lake edges and river channels.  Possible measures include cover cropping, crop rotation, filter strips, grass buffers, interseeding, and no-till options in the fall of the year.  \uf0a7 Exclude livestock from stream channels.  Fencing livestock out of the river reduces channel trampling (and nutrient / E.coli  inputs) and allows trees and other native species to re-vegetate the channel margins.    113   \uf0a7 Identify more stringent nutrient management practices in saturated runoff-contributing areas (RCAs).   Where these RCAs overlap with land uses that involve fertilizers or manure, manage nutrient applications to prevent mobilization of nutrients and sediments during snowmelt and precipitation events.  In many locations, RCAs extend to distances from the channel banks that exceed default buffer widths specified in regulations (e.g., AAPs) or existing management agreements (e.g., nutrient management plans).     \uf0a7 Modify AAPs to address the expected increase in runoff and inundation and erosion flooding over coming decades.  \uf0a7 Consider taking vulnerable (frequently-flooded), and marginally-suitable lands (with uncertain yields) out of agricultural production \u2013 with the support of various state-and federally-funded cost-share programs.  3.4.3 Built Environment  \uf0a7 Refrain from future developments and infrastructure in the river corridor to minimize future fluvial erosion losses.  This can be accomplished through conservation strategies or local planning and zoning strategies. \uf0a7 Update and improve the delineation of risks from erosion hazards and inundation flooding along Vermont\u2019s rivers \u2013 to incorporate channel and floodplain changes that have occurred during flooding of the last few decades and to address future climate-driven risks of flooding. \uf0a7 Where practical, and where risks to human safety are minimal, remove berms or other constraints along river channels and floodplains to create opportunities for sediment and flow attenuation \u2013 particularly upstream of developed areas. \uf0a7 Remove low-functioning or abandoned dams \uf0a7 Where practical, move infrastructure (e.g., roads, buildings, wastewater treatment plants) outside of floodprone areas.  \uf0a7 Flood-proof public buildings when relocation is not technically or economically feasible. \uf0a7 Where necessary, and as regulated through the permit process, limited sediment dredging from lakes may be required to maintain navigation channels or recreational areas. \uf0a7 Employ low-impact development strategies that minimize stormwater runoff and increase infiltration of rainwater and snowmelt.  o Establish or Increase Minimum Lot Sizes o Establish or Reduce Maximum Lot Coverages / Minimize Percent Impervious o Minimize land disturbance / compaction during construction  114  o Prevent stormwater outfalls from crossing vegetated buffers and entering rivers and streams without treatment or energy dissipation. o Specify maximum road and driveway widths.  \uf0a7 Design new bridge/culvert crossings with wider openings to pass flows, sediment, and woody debris without constriction.  1. Box 5.1 Otter Creek:  Importance of conserving wetlands for flood attenuation  Figure excerpted with permission from the Otter Creek Basin Plan, VTANR, 2012 (flow in the Otter Creek is from south to north \u2013 upward on the page) The role of riparian wetlands for flood attenuation was highlighted in the Otter Creek basin during Tropical Storm Irene in August of 2011.  Streamflow on the Otter Creek at the Rutland gage (307 square mile drainage area) peaked at 15,700 cubic feet per second at 3 AM on August 29.  Meanwhile further downstream in the watershed at the Middlebury gage (628 sq mi), flows were slow to rise and peaked well after the storm during the afternoon of September 2nd.  The Otter Creek channel between the Rutland and Middlebury gages is surrounded by 8,700 acres of riverside wetlands and floodplain forests known as the Otter Creek Swamps \u2013 the largest forested swamp complex in New England.  The Otter Creek spilled over its banks into the adjacent swamplands, which retained the floodwaters and slowly released them back to the river over several days following the storm.  This attenuation of floodwaters spared the downtown communities of Middlebury and Vergennes from significant damages in Irene.

Potential for Summer Dry Spells by Century\u2019s End  Warming temperatures and an expected increase in seasonal variability of rainfall and runoff may increase the potential for summer dry spells by century\u2019s end.  Evidence suggests that Vermont rivers have sustained higher base flows during summer months over recent decades, in contrast to other parts of New England (coastal Maine) and the US. However, climate projections indicate an increased potential for dry spells in summer months by the end of the century, which could lead to extended periods of very low stream and lake levels and reduced recharge to groundwater.   Over a typical year, river flows reach minimum levels in July through mid-September.  Precipitation rates are generally low, with the exception of an occasional convective or tropical storm.  Evapotranspiration rates are high due to maximum vegetative productivity and higher summer temperatures.  Soil moisture levels are low and groundwater reserves are near annual lows, resulting in minimal return flows to the river.  When a summer thunderstorm or even a tropical storm passes through, rains are quickly absorbed by the soils or taken up by vegetation and less is available for runoff to rivers, lakes and ponds.   As precipitation patterns continue to shift and temperatures warm with changing climate, we can expect changes in the water balance.  Higher-elevation (Green Mountains) and higher-latitude areas of Vermont (Northeast Kingdom) may be less impacted by warming temperatures.  While the Champlain Valley may be particularly vulnerable (TetraTech, 2013) as it is generally warmer and drier than other regions of Vermont. 4.1 Historic trends Historic data for Vermont (and New Hampshire) rivers indicate a rise in summer base flows from 1950 to 2006 that can be explained in part by increases in summer precipitation recorded in these regions (Hodgkins & Dudley, 2011).   Similar results were suggested by an analysis of flows at six gaging stations in the Winooski River basin for a study period from 1937 through 2003 (Hackett, 2009).  Despite conversion of cleared lands to forested lands in the latter half of the 20th century (open fields decreasing from 23% to 9%, forest cover increasing from 72% to 82%), and the associated rise in evapotranspiration rates, base-flows in the basin showed an increasing trend.  The increase in streamflows was strongly correlated to a 14% increase in precipitation over the period of record.     Ten out of eleven Vermont rivers evaluated indicate a similar positive trend (Figure 5.14) that is statistically significant (p<0.05; Mann-Kendall).  One river (Lamoille) exhibits a negative trend that is not statistically significant.  This Lamoille River gage may be influenced by operations at an upstream dam.  August median flows for five Vermont HCDN gages are examined in more detail in Figure 5.15.  The US Fish & Wildlife value of 0.5 cfs per square mile of watershed (Lang, 1999) has been adopted by the State of Vermont in its streamflow policy as an indicator of critical  116  habitat for native fish.  Trend lines in Figure 5.15 indicate that average low flows have been increasing in recent decades and are now above the 0.5 cfs per square mile threshold (though August median flow in any given year can still be well below this threshold). Figure 5.14.  Historic trends in 7-day low flows for select Vermont rivers. Positive trend (upward arrow) indicates increasing discharge value.  Negative trend (downward arrow) indicates decreasing discharge value.  Positive trend is statistically significant (p<0.05; Mann-Kendall) for 10 out of 11 rivers.  One river exhibits a negative trend that is not statistically significant.    117   Figure 5.15.  August median flows normalized to drainage area for five HCDN streamflow gages in Vermont.  Trend lines indicate that average low flows have been increasing over the decades and are now above the 0.5 cfs per square mile threshold commonly adopted as an indicator of critical habitat for native fish.   4.2 Projected trends Over the longer term, however, changing precipitation and runoff patterns are projected to result in lower summer baseflows, an extended low-flow period, and more frequent summer dry periods here in the Northeast (Frumhoff et al., 2007; NEICA, 2006; Hayhoe et al., 2007).  Climate projections for the Northeast indicate, on average, that the summer low-flow period will arrive one week earlier in the summer and be sustained up to three additional weeks into the fall months (NEICA, 2006).  Climate projections for the Lake Champlain basin suggest that, by late in the present century, average evapotranspiration rates will exceed average precipitation rates in the month of July, which could contribute to short-term dry spells (Guilbert et al., 2013).    Increasing summer temperatures would be expected to increase evapotranspiration from vegetated land surfaces.  If the amount of water lost to evaporation exceeds the amount of water gained through precipitation, this balance could reduce the amount of water that infiltrates to groundwater or runs off into rivers, lakes, and reservoirs.  Watersheds with a higher percentage of lakes, ponds, and wetlands may be more susceptible to the effects of increased temperature on evaporation rates, leading to lower base flows (Hodgkins & Dudley, 2011).  In general,  118  recharge to groundwater would be expected to decrease under scenarios of increased summer temperatures and increased evapotranspiration rates.  4.3 Impacts Low-flow periods in Vermont rivers are particularly critical for fish and other organisms that inhabit the river and streamside areas. Baseflows sustained by groundwater contributions are important for moderating water temperatures in the presence of elevated summer air temperatures and incoming solar radiation.  Locations of groundwater seeps in the channel represent cooler-water inputs that offer refuge from warmer summer temperatures for fish.  Baseflows are also critical for sustaining wetted channel margins to benefit aquatic insects, amphibians, reptiles, and other riparian organisms (Figure 16).      In the short term (early century), impacts to riparian and instream habitats may be moderated, given the observed increasing trend in baseflow (Figure 15).  If climate projections hold true for the late century, and low-flow periods become more frequent, these species will experience increased stress as a result of reduced availability of suitable habitat.  While it is relatively uncommon for Vermont stream reaches to dry up completely in the late summer months, such \u201closing reaches\u201d may become more common in the late century, and river sections with suitable habitats may become increasingly isolated.    Shallower waters are warmed more quickly.  Shallower pool depths and reduced contributions from cooler groundwater seeps will mean fewer refuge areas in the river network for cold-water species, including brook trout and freshwater mussels such as the eastern pearlshell.    As stream temperatures warm, the capacity to hold dissolved oxygen will be reduced.  Cool, well-oxygenated waters are critical for many aquatic organisms, such as brook trout.  If late-century increases in low-flow conditions are realized, cold-water species in particular will be impacted through reduced availability of cooler, oxygen-rich waters. Figure 5.16.  Wood turtles live and breed in riverside habitats and rely on Vermont streams for refuge and overwintering.  The Wood Turtle has been designated a Species of Greatest Conservation Need (high priority) in Vermont\u2019s Wildlife Action Plan, and is a species of special concern in Vermont.  119   In Vermonts deeper lakes, greater evaporation rates caused by increased summer air temperatures could result in lower than normal lake levels into early fall weeks.   \u201cRising surface water temperatures may increase the stability and duration of warm-season stratification \u2026, potentially making [them] more susceptible to nuisance phytoplankton blooms and low-oxygen (\u2018hypoxic\u2019) conditions\u201d  (Stager & Thill, 2010).  Warmer lake temperatures may lead to progressive loss of cooler, deep water zones with particular impacts to cold-water species including lake trout (Stager & Thill note that there is no clear record of this trend to date, although records are sparse).    In wetlands and vernal pools, water levels may decrease or dry up sooner due to increased evapotranspiration rates in summer months and the earlier timing of snowmelt.  These changes may adversely impact breeding cycles and survival of reptiles and amphibians such as the wood turtle or the spotted salamander.  \u201cAcidic bogs are expected to be particularly vulnerable because of their specialized habitat requirements (cold climate, short growing season, and slow rate of decay of organic matter)\u201d (TetraTech, 2013).  In general, productivity and abundance of aquatic organisms will be impacted by extended dry spells.  Generalist species, that are more adaptable to changing conditions will be favored, while organisms more sensitive to warm temperatures, soil moisture deficits, and decreased streamflows will be more impacted.  Particularly sensitive species will suffer physiological stress and possible mortality (Tetratech, 2013).  Adaptive invasive species \u2013 both aquatic and land-based - may become more prevalent as their productivity out-competes native species.  As a consequence, the species composition of aquatic and riparian habitats may change in ways that are not well understood.  The potential for increased dry spells and low-flow conditions will have water quality implications.  In lakes, oxygen-poor conditions driven by warming trends and extended thermal stratification may drive bio-geochemical cycles that encourage greater release of dissolved phosphorus from lake sediments (Tetra Tech, 2013).  Higher water temperatures can allow for greater incidence of mercury methylation. \u201cMethylmercury impairs organ and nerve functions in vertebrates, and through bioaccumulation it can compromise the health of predatory fish as well as the people and animals that eat them.\u201d (Stager and Thill, 2010).  During low-flow conditions projected for summer months, Vermont rivers will have a reduced assimilative capacity for receiving treated sewage or thermally-modified effluent.  Toxins and nutrients will be more concentrated.  Shallower water depths and higher temperatures in summer and early fall months may result in a greater likelihood of algae blooms in rivers and wetlands.  With increasing frequency of dry spells and drought near the end of the century, the quantity and quality of surface waters and groundwater may not be sufficient to meet human demand.  Availability and reliability of water resources will be affected in complex and unpredictable ways.   120  Increased competition for limited water resources will necessitate greater cooperation among a variety of users (see Section 5).    4.4 Opportunities to Build Resilience  Several strategies are available to address the potential for increasing summer dry spells or even long-term drought by end of century. \uf0b7 Conserve high-quality riparian habitats with intact forested buffers that offer habitat connectivity for aquatic and land-based organisms \u2013 with particular emphasis on higher-elevation, higher-latitude land areas. \uf0b7 Improve aquatic organism passage of culverts to open up more cold-water areas for refuge by temperature-sensitive species (see Box 5.2). \uf0b7 Remove unused or deteriorating dams, impoundments and diversion structures on Vermont rivers to increase habitat connectivity. \uf0b7 Fill buffer gaps along river reaches and lake edges by planting native shrub and tree species to offer waterside shading.  In addition to reduced water temperatures, tree buffers will provide organic matter and woody debris recruitment for aquatic and riparian habitats.  A more robust riverside community will be more resilient in the face of other climate-induced stressors. \uf0b7 Add large woody debris to restore pool/riffle habitat diversity (e.g., Battenkill River); \uf0b7 Improve capacity and treatment at waste-water treatment facilities to reduce the nutrient and toxin levels in effluent discharged to rivers and lakes. \uf0b7 Diversify farming practices toward crops and other endeavors that rely less on water and irrigation. \uf0b7 Take measures to conserve water use at home, schools, businesses and industry (for example, use water-saving flow valves; water lawns and gardens during dawn and dusk hours to minimize loss of water to evaporation when sun is highest in the sky; collect rain water from rooftops in barrels to reuse for watering gardens; install rain gardens to collect rainwater and runoff to recharge groundwater). \uf0a8 Employ low-impact development strategies that minimize stormwater runoff and increase infiltration of rainwater and snowmelt.  \uf0a8 Subject to state and local approvals, various sectors could consider diversion of surface waters to off-stream reservoirs during higher-flow times of the year so that water will be available during low-flow periods without direct impacts to river flows (e.g., Vermont ski areas have been following this approach for snow-making ponds) \uf0a8 Promote forest cover and minimize impervious surfaces in headwaters and known groundwater recharge areas.   121     \uf0b7 5. Uncertain Impacts to Water Resources Changing rainfall and runoff patterns will affect availability and reliability of water resources to a variety of Vermont sectors (e.g., agriculture, communities, tourism, energy) in complex ways.  Water is considered relatively abundant in the Northeast, and the quantity of water resources is generally not regarded as a limitation for use as much as potential quality issues.  At present, Vermonters meet their water needs from a combination of groundwater and surface water sources.  Figure 16 is excerpted from a recent USGS publication that summarized groundwater and surface water sources by category of use (Medalie & Horn, 2010).  If thermoelectric power sources are not considered (Entergy Nuclear - Vermont Yankee Power Station in Vernon, Vermont, scheduled to close in 2014), groundwater and surface water sources represent 51% Box 5.2 \u2013 Reducing channel constrictions through installation of open-arch road crossings. The US Forest Service recently installed an open-arch crossing for the Natural Turnpike road over the Sparks Brook, tributary to the Middle Branch of the Middlebury River, in the Green Mountain National Forest.  In 2010, a bottomless arch was constructed to replace a small-diameter culvert that was undersized with respect to the bankfull width of the Sparks Brook channel. The bottomless arch and channel vicinity were designed in accordance with Vermont Fish & Wildlife guidance for passage of aquatic organisms (Stream Simulation Design). The open (bottomless) design permits more naturalized flow of water, sediment and woody debris, and opens up more cold-water habitat for refuge from an expected warming climate.

Private and public community water system uses make up 63% of the total.     Figure 5.16. Groundwater and surface water withdrawals in Vermont by category of use. (Excerpted with permission from Medalie & Horn, 2010, USGS SIR 2010-5053). With expected late-century decreases in summertime baseflows, availability of groundwater and surface water may become more limited seasonally, as various sectors compete for their use.  There may be increased demand on surface water resources from the agricultural sector to irrigate during short-term dry spells or droughts.  Hydropower facilities may experience more frequent interruptions in service at times when river flows drop below minimum operating levels established in their federal and state permits (see Callout Box). Where permitted under state regulations, the ski industry may increase water withdrawals for snow-making to combat declines in thickness and duration of snowpack expected by late in the century.  We may see a shift toward more groundwater use in general, which in turn could reduce baseflows in Vermont rivers.  \u201c[Surface] water withdrawals or other stream flow alterations may become more common, and human uses may compete with aquatic management needs.\u201d (Pealer & Dunnington, 2012).  Vermont may be a receiving state for climate refugees as Northeast coastal populations are increasingly impacted by rising sea levels.  As Vermont communities grow in size, there will be  123  increasing demands on water supplies in support of various sectors, with possibility for inter-sector competition.     Box 5.3 \u2013 Potential climate change impacts to Vermont\u2019s hydroelectric industry  \u201cPresently Vermont has 84 operating hydroelectric plants.  They are distributed throughout the state, and are owned by public and private utilities, electric co-ops, companies and individuals. The plants have a total generating capacity of 190 megawatts (MW), and produce on average 12 percent of Vermont\u2019s KWH load\u201d. (Renewable Energy Vermont, www.revermont.org.) State and federal regulations require that minimum stream flows necessary for the protection of instream habitats are provided in the river reach associated with a hydropower facility.  The minimum required flow is unique to each facility and is based on the impacted length of the channel, as well as habitat and species present in the channel.  Most hydropower facilities operate as \u201crun-of-river\u201d facilities, such that flows into the hydroelectric project equal flows leaving the project.  There is typically a bypass segment of the river where flows are reduced since a portion of the flow is diverted through a penstock to turbines in the powerhouse.  Regulation of minimum flows includes the bypass segment.    With increasing potential for low flows by end of century, operations at these hydroelectric facilities may be curtailed for longer periods of time in order to meet minimum flow requirements.  With more frequent high-flow events there will be a higher risk for catastrophic damages at these facilities, and accelerated build up of sediments (and reduced reservoir capacity) behind associated impoundments.  124  6. Summary Table Rating Quality of Information  Key Message #1/5  As average annual rainfall has increased in recent decades, average annual flows in Vermont rivers have increased.  Based on climate model projections, average annual streamflows are expected to continue increasing in coming decades.  Evidence base:  Observed trends:  \uf0b7 New England / Northeast (Collins, Mathias J., 2009; Hodgkins and Dudley, 2005; Huntington et al, 2009; Lins & Slack, 2005) \uf0b7 Vermont (Hodgkins et al.; 2010; Hackett, 2009; Guilbert & Underwood, 2013) Forecasted trends:  \uf0b7 New England / Northeast (Huntington et al, 2007);  \uf0b7 Vermont ()  Uncertainties and data gaps:  Efforts to improve the information base should address the coordinated monitoring of sentinel streamflow gaging sites.  Monitoring is critical to tracking and quantifying impacts on climate change and the effectiveness of adaptation and mitigation strategies.  Monitoring of the streamflow gaging network coordinated by USGS should be expanded and funded as a national and regional priority.  While forecasted trends are more uncertain, they provide an important basis for adaptive management and resiliency planning.  Assessment of confidence based on evidence:  Very High   Key Message #2/5  Warming temperatures are leading to earlier thaw dates on Vermont rivers, lakes and ponds as well as earlier thaw dates for snowpack in the mountains.  Earlier thaw dates and changing precipitation patterns have caused streamflows to shift seasonally.   Average monthly flows in January and March,  125  as well as July, August, and October through December, have increased while average monthly flows in April and May have decreased.    Evidence base:  Observed trends:  \uf0b7 New England / Northeast (Hodgkins et al, 2003; Hodgkins and Dudley, 2006; Huntington et al, 2009; Lins & Slack, 2005) \uf0b7 Vermont (Betts, 2011b; Hacket, 2009; Guilbert & Underwood, 2013) Forecasted trends:  \uf0b7 New England / Northeast (Hayhoe, et al, 2007);  \uf0b7 Vermont (Guilbert et al., 2013)     Uncertainties and data gaps:   None identified at this time. Assessment of confidence based on evidence:  High   Key Message #3/5  High flows are larger in magnitude and are occurring more frequently, often in the winter months associated with earlier thaw dates for snowpack.  In the coming decades, climate models project that a greater fraction of winter precipitation will fall as rain or freezing rain rather than snow, leading to rain-on-snow events and rain on frozen ground, with associated flooding.  Up to an 80% increase in the probability of high flows is projected under assumptions of high green-house-gas emissions by the end of the century.  Evidence base:  Observed trends:  \uf0b7 New England / Northeast: (Hodgkins & Dudley, 2005; Collins, 2009; Huntington et al, 2009; McCabe & Wolock, 2002)  \uf0b7 Vermont: (Hodgkins & Dudley, 2005; Collins, 2009; Guilbert & Underwood, 2013) Forecasted trends:  \uf0b7 New England / Northeast: (Frumhoff et al, 2007; Hayhoe et al., 2007) \uf0b7 Vermont ( )   126  Uncertainties and data gaps:  Increased risk of floods is not easily quantified or communicated to the public.  There is a need for re-evaluation and framing of flood risk in order to more effectively inform community planning, infrastructure design and maintenance, as well as risk to public safety and health.  Assessment of confidence based on evidence:  High   Key Message #4/5  Warming temperatures and an expected increase in seasonal variability of rainfall and runoff may increase the potential for summer dry spells by century\u2019s end.  Evidence suggests that Vermont rivers have sustained higher base flows during summer months over recent decades, in contrast to other parts of New England (coastal Maine) and the US. However, climate projections indicate an increased potential for dry spells in summer months by the end of the century, which could lead to extended periods of very low stream and lake levels and reduced recharge to groundwater.  Evidence base:  Observed trends:  \uf0b7 New England / Northeast (Hodgkins & Dudley, 2011; ) \uf0b7 Vermont (Hodgkins & Dudley, 2011;  Hackett, 2009; Guilbert & Underwood, 2013 ) Forecasted trends:  \uf0b7 New England / Northeast (Frumhoff et al, 2007; NEICA, 2006; Hayhoe et al, 2007) \uf0b7 Vermont (Guilbert et al, 2013)   Uncertainties and data gaps:   Impacts on groundwater aquifers may be highly variable.  At present, groundwater in Vermont is not well characterized due to funding limitations.  There is a need for additional assessment, particularly in more densely populated areas where future demands on groundwater are expected to increase.  Assessment of confidence based on evidence:  Medium     127  Key Message #5/5 Changing rainfall, runoff and temperature patterns will affect availability and reliability of water resources to a variety of Vermont sectors (e.g., agriculture, communities, tourism, energy) in complex ways.

Models project that by the end of the century, an oak-hickory forest could dominate the Northeast with spruce-fir forests being virtually non-existent, and maple-beech-birch forests persisting only in Maine.  \uf0b7 Alterations in precipitation cycles (wetter winters and extended dry spells in late summer/fall) will place more stress on important tree species such as sugar maple and red spruce, which have already experienced periods of decline in Vermont. Warmer temperatures will result in earlier bud burst and flowering periods for certain species, making them more susceptible to pests and pathogens.  \uf0b7 Increases in frequency and severity in natural disturbances as a result of climate change will affect Vermont forest ecosystems and forest cover.  Vermont is the third most forested state of the lower 48, with over 4.6 million acres of forest.  \uf0b7 Climate change will cause alterations in forest-pest/pathogen dynamics, as warmer temperatures allow for invasive pests and pathogens to expand in numbers and distribution in Vermont\u2019s forests, and high carbon affects physiology of trees, herbivorous insects, and phytophagous pathogens. \uf0b7 The loss of cold-tolerant boreal forests in Vermont will result in declines in birds that depend on this habitat type including Bicknell\u2019s thrush (Catharus bicknelli), a globally rare species vulnerable to extinction. \uf0b7 Vermont\u2019s forests currently remove approximately 75,000 metric tons of carbon from the atmosphere per year, valued at 16 million dollars. The role of Vermont\u2019s forests in carbon uptake will continue to be of value and likely increase as pressure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions amplifies with climate change. \uf0b7 Several other human-driven factors impacting Vermont forests including parcelization and fragmentation will interact with the effects of climate change, requiring managers to adopt an adaptive management approach.  133  1. Introduction Climate change is having both gradual and long-term effects, direct and indirect on forests (Figure 1), including changes to biodiversity, productivity, forest structure, and ecosystem services (U.S. Geological Survey 2009, VT Department of Forest, Parks & Recreation 2010). Forests provide multiple valuable resources, including ecological diversity, ecosystem services, and ecosystem resilience, many of which are hard to quantify and therefore protect. Direct effects of climate change on forests include increased water use and evaporation as a result of warmer winters and longer growing seasons. Increased water use will decrease soil moisture, contributing to dry spells during summer, and decreased forest productivity. This will result in increased susceptibility of trees to disease, invasive species infestations, and threaten silvicultural resources (Rustad et al. 2012). Vermont forests in particular are vulnerable to increasing infestations by invasive species and damage from more severe and frequent forest disturbances as a result of climate change. Habitat ranges of certain Vermont tree species are at risk as temperatures increase with the potential to be pushed northward by the end of the century.   Forests also play an important role in reducing climate change through capturing and storing carbon and providing bioenergy resources. U.S. forests currently absorb approximately 13% of all carbon dioxide emitted through fossil fuel burning (EPA 2012) and forestland resources in the U.S. have the potential to produce bioenergy from over 600 million acres of timberland and forestland combined (DOE 2011). The combination of climate change induced threats to forest resources and the value of forests in reducing future climate change increase the need for sustainable future management of our forest ecosystems.  1.1 Forest Structure  Forest ecosystems protect water quality, cycle nutrients, capture air pollutants, provide habitat, and help maintain biodiversity. They provide resilience again natural disturbances, climate variability, and invasive species. We depend on healthy forests to moderate temperature and reduce valley flooding, for tourism and economic resources, and for food and medicine (Vermont Monitoring Cooperative 2009). Humans have already altered most of the world\u2019s forests though our land-Figure 6.1 Direct and indirect effects of climate change on forests. Adapted from Keeton et al. 2007  134  use history (Houghton 1994), only increasing the need to protect this invaluable resource as it continues to be altered by climate change.     1.2 Species Composition and Structure Vermont\u2019s forests have not always been hardwood dominated as they are today. When glaciers receded 11,000 years ago, the first forests of Vermont were dominated by black spruce and paper birch. As the climate warmed, spruce and fir remained in higher elevations while lower elevations were dominated by eastern white pine, maple, birch, hemlock, beech, oak, and hickory, what has created the mosaic of mixed northern hardwood forests covering Vermont\u2019s landscape today (Wharton et al. 2003), (see Figure 6.1). Widespread 19th-century clearing for agriculture shifted the majority of Vermont\u2019s forests from primary (never cleared) to secondary (regenerating) forests. Compared to primary forests, secondary forests are often less complex, younger in age, lack vertical and horizontal structure, and have fewer numbers of both live and dead trees (Keeton et al. 2007). This has direct effects on the ecological diversity of these ecosystems, especially their resilience to variability in climate and potential disturbances.  Approximately 78 percent, or 4.6 million acres, of Vermont is forested (Wharton et al. 2003), 86% of which is privately owned (Vermont Monitoring Cooperative 2009). Forest cover in Vermont plateaued and in 1997 began to decline slightly (Nowak et al. 2008). This trend may be attributable to forested land conversions and a combination of tree removals and tree mortality (VT Department of Forest, Parks & Recreation 2010). However, abandoned agricultural land, which is not accounted for in the forest inventory, but functions as wildlife corridors and riparian habitat, may offset this decline. 1.3 Projected changes to forest species habitat ranges, composition, and structure Northeastern forests have been experiencing transitions in climate and species composition for tens of thousands of years. Forests are slow to respond to such variations, however, and it is therefore difficult to accurately model future forest species distributions as a result of climate change as humans accelerate the rate at which climate transitions are occurring. Trees have long life spans, slow dispersal rates and  ability to adapt genetically to changing climate, adding to the complexity of modeling future suitable ranges based on such factors as increasing temperature Figure 6.2 Vermont Forest Cover Types. Map created by W. Seegers, UVM Spatial Analysis Lab, adapted from Vermont Forest Resources Plan (2010 (Vermont Department of Forests, Parks and Recreation 2010).   135  (Rustad et al. 2012). Human-accelerated climate change is making it even less clear how forests will respond to changes in suitable habitat. Increasing temperatures and changes in amounts of precipitation are already affecting Vermont forests. 1.4 Impacts to suitable habitat ranges Climate models project dramatic range shifts of dominant tree species in the northeastern U.S. over the next 100 years (Rustad et al. 2012). High elevation spruce-fir forests in southern Vermont are most vulnerable to rising temperatures associated with climate change (TetraTech 2013), and climate models project their suitable habitat range to be virtually nonexistent in the northeast within 100 years (Rustad et al. 2012). Oak-pine forests, which are more tolerant to warmer temperatures, are projected to expand northward in Vermont and throughout the northeast, replacing current dominant hardwood species like maple and birch (Rustad et al. 2012, Wilmot 2011). However, species respond both individually and as a community, making it difficult to truly predict exactly how species will respond to the effects of climate change over time. Temperatures have already seen a consistent warming trend in Vermont over the past 100 years. The average summer temperature has increased by 0.4 degrees Fahrenheit (0.22 degrees Celsius) per decade in Vermont, while winter temperatures have increased by 0.9 degrees Fahrenheit per decade over the past 100 years (0.5 degrees Celsius; National Weather Service 2013). Growing seasons have lengthened by an average of 3.7 days per decade, and are projected to increase (Betts 2011a, Betts 2011b, UCS 2006). These changes support model predictions toward a shift in growing zones north and downward in elevation, reducing suitable habitat for certain key Vermont species like red spruce and balsam fir, and allowing northern hardwood trees to survive at higher elevations. Spruce-fir forests are therefore most vulnerable to changes associated with climate change (Manomet 2009, Iverson et al. 2008, Woodall et al. 2009).  High elevation spruce-fir forests in Vermont are already experiencing changes in species distribution (Beckage et al. 2008). This study of forest composition on the western slopes of the Green Mountains indicates shifts in tree species range are already occurring. The boundary between the northern hardwood forest and boreal forest in this location has shifted upslope from 299 to 390 feet between 1964 and 2004 (Beckage et al. 2008). Although likely influenced by climate change, there are other compounding factors such as acid deposition and land use change that could also be affecting this forest range alteration.  According to multiple climate and vegetation models predicting habitat changes for common tree species across the Northeast, suitable habitat for 47 of 84 species is predicted to increase, decrease for 31 species, and remain unchanged for six species (Iverson et al. 2008). These models use data from the US Forest Service Forest Inventory Analysis models under low and high future emissions scenarios. Under both emissions scenarios, changes in suitable habitat are projected to significantly decrease for certain ecologically and economically important species such as sugar maple and balsam fir across the Northeast (Rustad et al. 2012). Some models project forests of the Northeast to shift from maple-birch forests to more southern adapted, oak-hickory forests, as shown by the map below (Figure 6.3).  136   1.5 Impacts to species composition and structure Climate change models project summer dry spells in Vermont to become more severe as temperatures increase. Warmer temperatures in the summer combined with less precipitation will increase stress on Vermont\u2019s forests. Sugar maple., a landmark Vermont species, has already experienced periods of significant decline during previous dry periods in Vermont and is especially at risk therefore to potentially amplified summer drought and heat stress (Vermont Monitoring Cooperative 2009). The Champlain Valley is warmer and drier than other parts of Vermont, making its ecosystems particularly vulnerable to heat stress and water limitations associated with climate change. It is likely that increased heat stress and water limitations will have an overall effect on forest health and productivity in Vermont (TetraTech 2013).  It is difficult to predict how forest structure will truly shift in response to climate change, as species are able to evolve and adapt over time both individualistically and communally in response to the effects of climate change. In Vermont, research has already shown changes in high-elevation species compositions over the past few decades. Vegetation surveys completed between 1964 and 2006 on Camel\u2019s Hump in Vermont have found evidence of species elevation distributions and composition shifts in response to an increase of 0.49 degrees F warming per decade (Pucko et al. 2011). Species responses to warming temperatures in this study were complex and individualistic at some elevations while at others species responded in communities. Overall, most species experienced a decline in population abundance over the survey period with the greatest amount of species compositional change experienced at the higher elevations. Samples were taken of the lower elevation, northern hardwood forests (maple, beech, birch) and high elevation spruce-fir forest. Although there were varying response levels to species shifts (both individual and group) in this study, it did prove that species are already responding to a minimal amount of climate change-induced warming temperatures in Vermont. The changes observed on Camel\u2019s Hump in overstory and understory vegetation were from less than two degrees of annual mean temperature increase (Pucko et al. 2011). Even with maximum emissions reductions, climate models predict a minimum temperature increase much more than we have already experienced by the end of the century. It is likely species shifts will remain constant or Figure 6.3 Projected suitable habitat for forest type/tree species in New England under low and high emissions scenarios (Rustad et al. 2012)   137  accelerate over the next century, and communities will become more divergent in their responses to the amplified effects of climate change (Pucko et al. 2011). This will make it more difficult to predict how species will respond in range and distribution, especially locally, to climate change.  The table below (Table 6.1) indicates tree species decline related to climate factors for key species across the Northeast. Species listed have been experiencing decline for multiple decades, likely augmented by climate change-induced factors. Other species of concern in Vermont in particular are sugar maple and eastern hemlock. Sugar maples are a landmark tree to Vermont\u2019s forest ecosystem both culturally and ecologically, and hemlock trees provide important habitat and biodiversity niches in our northern forest ecosystems. The boxes following Table 1 and later in this chapter provides more detail associated with threats these two species face from climate change related factors.

Many Vermonters worry about the maple industry in the face of climate change. Here are some of the facts on how climate change impacts our maple trees:  \uf0b7 Warmer temperatures combined with longer growing seasons results in earlier bud break, increasing the susceptibility of trees to pests and pathogens. \uf0b7 There are already documented correlations between sugar maple die back and periods of drought and forest tent caterpillar outbreaks. These have the potential to increase with the likelihood of increasing dry spells due to climate change.  \uf0b7 Sugar maple leaf out dates are becoming earlier each season with warming temperatures, as indicated by the below figure. Leaf out dates could continue to move forward as temperatures continue to rise with climate change. Earlier leaf out and flower development increases sugar maples\u2019 susceptibility to pest outbreaks. \uf0b7 Tree health, soil moisture, and temperature affect sap production \u2013 climate change threatens VT\u2019s maple sugar industry due to reduced sap flow days as a result of warmer temperatures and a decline in sugar maple health (Skinner et al. 2010).   (Data from Proctor Maple Research Center; Vermont Monitoring Cooperative 2009)  Figure 2 \u2013 Sugar maple leaf out dates at Proctor Research Center on Mount Mansfield Source: Vermont Monitoring Cooperative 2009   Figure 6.4 Changes in sugar maple leaf out dates from Procter Maple Research Center, Vermont (Vermont Cooperative Monitoring Program 2009)  139  2.  Forest Productivity Forest productivity is a measure of the net growth rate of a forest, or its net primary productivity (NPP). It is a combination of plant growth, reproductive success, biomass accumulation, phenology, and nutrient cycling. The amount of biomass (live and dead trees) added to a forest over time is a way to gauge its productivity, which is important because this affects the rate at which a forest produces timber and sequesters carbon (Rustad et al. 2012). Biomass accumulation increases when growth exceeds mortality in a forest.  A forest\u2019s soils are critical to forest health, providing nutrient cycling, physical support, habitat, and water quality protection. Soil texture, drainage, depth, and fertility are all important characteristics of forest health. Soils also play an important role in storing carbon through different levels of nutrient cycling (Vermont Monitoring Cooperative 2009).  2.1 Changes in forest productivity Climate change\u2019s effects on growing season length and tree regeneration will affect forest biomass accumulation. Above ground live tree biomass has been decreasing on the east slope and the summit of Mount Mansfield since 1997 due to such stress events as the ice storm of 1998 and drought in 1999 (Vermont Monitoring Cooperative 2009). Stress from extreme weather events and changes increased and decreased moisture levels will continue to affect biomass levels in Vermont forests.  Changes in forest productivity on the small and large scale are unclear. Longer growing seasons and higher levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide could increase productivity, yet stresses imposed by water limitations, temperature and disturbance changes could decrease productivity (Rustad et al. 2012). 2.2 Impacts to tree regeneration Tree regeneration in Vermont has the potential to be affected by changes in growing season due to climate change. Many tree species, like sugar maples and apple trees, depend on seasonal cold temperatures for regeneration. Earlier spring thaws and later frosts have already been damaging sugar maple buds and roots, affecting maple tree productivity, and also increasing apple tree susceptibility to certain pests (TetraTech 2013). (For more information on the effects of climate change on Vermont apple trees, refer to the Agriculture Chapter 7.)  Spring leaf-out is occurring earlier as a result of shorter winters. Research from northern hardwood forests at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire found significantly earlier spring leaf-out with an increase in green canopy of 10 days over a 47-year period (Richardson et al. 2006). Although extended growth periods should increase productivity, other stressors (water, heat, disease, pests, and acid deposition) often limit the extent to which forests are able to take advantage of longer growing seasons (Rustad et al. 2012).  Increased carbon dioxide levels (CO2 fertilization) and temperatures leading to longer growing seasons may increase tree growth rates initially which is often seen as a potential positive effect of climate change. However, despite CO2 fertilization, which improves water use efficiency, a longer growing season may result in increased rates of evapotranspiration, drying out soils  140  leading to dry spells or short-term droughts. This will ultimately negatively affect tree growth through limited water availability (Wilmot 2011 and Huntington et al. 2009). Additionally, other factors associated with climate change that are also increasing (disturbance, invasive species) will continue to confound on the long term negative effects on tree growth.  Table 6.2 below describes some of the confounding factors that will work against the more immediate, positive effect of increased growth rates from elevated CO2 and longer growing seasons projected for forest ecosystems in the Northeast.  Table 6.2 Confounding factors affecting forest productivity (Rustad et al. 2012). Confounding Factor Effect COMPETITION Competition between species will increase as suitable habitat shifts (south to north) and some forest types replace others (high elevation softwood forests are replaced by hardwood forests in Vermont, for example). NUISANCE SPECIES Increased infestations by invasive species, pests, and pathogens; Hemlock woolly adelgid, pine blister rust, and emerald ash borer are already having major effects on forest productivity in the U.S. and Canada and seriously threaten Vermont\u2019s forests. DROUGHT (DRY SPELLS) Increased evapotranspiration will decrease soil moisture augmenting summer dry periods and associated plant stresses. AIR POLLUTION Potential increased amounts of air pollutants due to climate change can alter forest productivity and influence how trees respond to climate change; these include ground-level ozone, acids, and nitrogen compounds. ACID DEPOSITION Acid deposition, already an issue across the Northeast, may increase with increasing cloud cover and precipitation; this will affect high elevation forests (boreal spruce-fir forests in Vermont), many of which are already suffering from impaired nutrient availability and leaf damage as a result of acid deposition.   2.4 Impacts to soils and nutrient cycling Increasing precipitation amounts in the winter could result in increased runoff from forest soils and also nutrient loss from within soils. The effects of changing temperature and precipitation amounts on other aspects of forest productivity such as nutrient cycles are still unknown (TetraTech 2013).   141   3. Forest Disturbances Ecological disturbance is an important factor in the diversity and complexity of forests globally. Forests are commonly impacted by biotic factors including pests and pathogens that attack trees and other plants, and abiotic factors such as severe weather-related events (flood, wind, freeze/thaw cycles, wildfire, etc.).   While Vermont forests will continue to be subject to disturbance, climate change is forecast to impact the long-term condition of Vermont forests by changing ecological disturbance frequencies and perhaps disturbance intensities.  Beyond changes to individual disturbance vectors, climate change may lead to ecological change in situations where trees are already stressed by factors including unsustainably high tree densities, and the presence of pests and pathogens (Winnett 1998).  The specific outcomes of interactions among biotic agents, abiotic interruptions and climate change are not clear (Anderson et al. 2004). However, abiotic factors such as temperature and moisture affect host susceptibility to pathogens and pathogen aggressiveness, changes in interactions between biotic diseases and abiotic stressors may represent the most substantial effect of climate change on plant diseases.  Although the impacts of individual disturbances such as forest pathogens\u2028on forest structure and function have been studied, there is little research on the interactions of climate and disturbance (Dale and others 2000). Thus, the extent to which climate change will affect the frequency, severity, or magnitude of disturbances is difficult to predict (Loehle and LeBlanc 1996). Research on impacts of climate change on plant pathogens has been limited, with most work concentrating on the effects of a single disturbance on the tree host, or the interaction of a single disturbance and climate. Disturbances may interact in a cumulative or cascading manner, with increases in Box 6.2 Structural Complexity Enhancement (SCE) Forest Management Disturbance-based forestry treatments that promote late-successional forest structure characteristics have beneficial effects on forest habitat, biomass retention, and structural diversity. An experimental silvicultural treatment in which structural complexity enhancement logging treatments were tested on Mount Mansfield and in Jericho through the Forest Ecosystem Management Demonstration Project (FEMDP) have proven to enhance forest structure when compared to conventional logging practices (Keeton 2006, Vermont Monitoring Cooperative 2009). These treatments provided merchantable timber while also retaining biomass, habitat, and carbon storage potentials.  Structure achieved through SCE silvicultural techniques (Keeton 2006):  \uf0b7 Vertical and horizontal heterogeneity \uf0b7 Variation in tree size class and age distribution \uf0b7 Increased levels of species diversity \uf0b7 Recruitment of coarse woody debris  \uf0b7 Canopy gap formation  Disturbance-based logging practices which add structure to forest ecosystems while also generating revenue for landowners provide many opportunities for Vermont landowners in particular to sustainably manage their forests in the face of climate change.         142  one type of disturbance increasing the potential for other types of disturbances. (Kliejunas et al. 2009). 3.1 Biotic factors Climate change will directly affect the extent and severity of forest disease- and pest- related tree mortality, depending on how the pathogen, the host, and the interaction between them change in response to novel climate patterns (Brasier 2005, Burdon et al. 2006).  There exists a real potential for host tree species to become more susceptible to a pest or pathogen, or for climate change to lead to environmental conditions to become more suitable for the pest or pathogen, resulting in increased incidence of attack or disease (Kliejunas et al. 2009).  Many pests and pathogens currently are limited by winter temperature, and seasonal increases in temperature are expected to be greatest during winter. Accordingly, both overwintering survival of pests and pathogens and disease severity are likely to increase. Disease results from the interaction among a susceptible host, a virulent pathogen, and environmental conditions that support the pathogen. Determinants of forest response to insects and pathogens include characteristics (e.g. host specificity, aggressiveness, mode of attack) of the pest or pathogen, and the capacity of a forest to resist or recover from attack (Ayres and Lombardero 2000, Harrington 2002, Logan et al.\u20282003, Lovett et al. 2006). Pests and pathogens, particularly species of fungi, may also be negatively impacted by climate change, as the host trees they depend on change in phenology, disease and pest resistance and range.  For example, increased carbon dioxide concentrations resulting from climate change will coincide with lowered nutrient concentrations, greater accumulation of carbohydrates in leaves, and more plant defenses including waxes, protective cells and fibers (Chakraborty and others 1998). Two important effects of elevated carbon dioxide on host-pathogen interactions will be a delay in initial establishment of a pathogen and increased fecundity of pathogens (Coakley and others 1999). An increase in carbon dioxide may increase tree canopy size and density, resulting in a higher microclimate relative humidity, and a subsequent increase in foliar and rust diseases (Manning and Tiedemann 1995).  143   3.2 Abiotic factors Historically, large-scale abiotic disturbance events have been rare in the Northern Forest.  However, when such disturbances do occur, windstorms including derechos, tornadoes, downbursts and icestorms are most frequently the cause.  Typically these events result in high Box 6.3 Hemlock woolly adelgid Increasing temperatures associated with climate change in Vermont will drive the abundance, timing of life cycles and physical characteristics of species, including forest pests and pathogens.  Hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA; Adelges tsugae), a scale-like insect introduced from Japan, has attacked and caused widespread mortality of eastern hemlock trees (Tsuga canadensis) in North America.  HWA siphons nutrients from live hemlock tree phloem, but also injects a toxic saliva that causes loss of foliage and decreased growth; attacked trees typically die six years after HWA infestation (McClure 1991).  Originally introduced to Virginia in the 1950s, HWA has spread south to Georgia, and north to southern Maine, New Hampshire and Bennington and Windham Counties in Vermont (Paradis et al. 2007).  The impacts of HWA infestation in New England are expected to be more severe than in the southern extent of the range, as hemlock is more abundant in the Northern Forest (Paradis et al. 2007).  However, the colder winter temperatures of New England result in higher HWA mortality, and so slower population growth, relative to HWA at the southern extent of its North American range (Shields and Cheah 2004).  As winter minimum temperatures increase with climate change, HWA populations will expand rapidly as this limitation abates.  Ultimately, the loss of hemlock trees to HWA attack will have cascading negative impacts on New England ecosystems, including the increase of stream temperatures due to the loss of shading perennial foliage, the decline of wildlife species dependent on hemlock (e.g. Blackburnian warbler, Setophaga fusca, Rustad et al. 2012) and perennial cold water streams (salamanders, aquatic invertebrates; Ellison et al. 2005), higher rates of soil respiration and decomposition, a lack of plant-performed water filtering, and shifts in hemlock-associated plant communities (Paradis et al. 2007).  Under the IPCC\u2019s most conservative climate change scenario maximum winter temperatures will reach 23 degrees Fahrenheit (-5 degrees Celsius); with this temperature change HWA will be established in the southern half of New England.  Under the IPCC\u2019s highest carbon emissions scenarios, all of New England will be subject to HWA infestation (Paradis et al. 2007).    Figure 6.5 Hemlock Woolly Adelgid (US Forest Service)   144  mortality of mature trees, canopy gaps, reductions in tree density and size structure, and changes in local habitat conditions at the stand level (Dale et al. 2001).  Research suggests that these severe weather-related disturbances may be increasing in frequency as a consequence of climate change (Schelhaas et al. 2003). Changes in climate including increased temperature, increased evapotranspiration, and extreme weather events may create unusually high levels of stress in forest stands (Columbia Mountains Institute of Applied Ecology 2005, Sturrock 2007). Forests already stressed by high tree density, pathogens, or atmospheric conditions may not survive the additional climatic stress (Winnett 1998).   The impact of these abiotic changes may be amplified as tree decline and mortality resulting from interactions between climate change and biotic factors weaken the resistance and resilience of forests.  For example, stands where a high proportion of trees killed by insect outbreak are typically more susceptible to wildfire, given higher dry fuel loads (Bergeron and Leduc 1998, Hepting and Jemison 1958).   4.  Projected impacts to wildlife As forest types in the Northeast shift in response to climate change, wildlife populations including mammals, birds, amphibians, and beneficial insects will be impacted at all scales from physiological function to geographic distribution; however, little research has documented or forecast changes in these groups resulting from climate change and habitat shifts (Rodenhouse et al. 2009).  Across groups, climate change is likely to most severely impact species that have narrow habitat requirements, rely on habitat consisting of small, isolated blocks, are highly specialized to depend on small variety of plants, or are already declining or threatened Box 6.4 December 2010 Windstorm A severe, prolonged windstorm blew into western and central Vermont on December 1, 2010, during a period of heavy precipitation totaling as much as 2.36 inches of rain between November 30 and December 2, 2010 (Nash, Meteorologist-in-Charge, NOAA/National Weather Service-Burlington, VT, pers. comm. 2013).  Sustained 20-35 mph winds from the southwest swelled in gusts over 50 mph in the Champlain Valley and hurricane force winds in excess of 73 mph raked across the Green Mountain ridge (Whittier 2010).  Addison, Bennington, Chittenden, Franklin, Grand Isle, Lamoille, and Rutland Counties collectively suffered $3.5 million in property damage; fortunately no storm-related deaths or injuries were reported (NOAA Storm Event Database).  In forests across Chittenden, Franklin and Lamoille counties patches of mature canopy as large as 20 hectares fell in the onslaught of wind.  Forest managers were immediately faced with decisions regarding post-storm management without the benefit of information regarding likely outcomes.  While stand-level disturbances (e.g. insect outbreak, wild fire) occur with some frequency and have been studied in the forests of western North America, such disturbances are relatively rare in the Northern Forest.  As a result, there are few examples of management strategies following large-scale disturbances.  Forest managers in Vermont elected to salvage harvest stands impacted by the 2010 windstorm to varying degrees.  Given the likelihood that such storms will occur increasingly frequently in the Northern Forest as a result of climate change, researchers are currently quantifying ecological and economic outcomes of these management actions with the goal of informing future post-windstorm management.    145  (Rodenhouse et al. 2009).  Further research aimed at quantifying climate change impacts to northeastern fauna should focus on physiological and behavioral adaptations, food web dynamics, and impacts of interactions among climate change and other human-induced disturbances (e.g. development, timber harvest, acid deposition) (Rodenhouse et al. 2009). In the Northeast, birds have received the most research attention aimed at quantifying consequences of climate change in fauna.  Research suggests that some forest bird populations will shift northward and expand outside of their current range; as a result Vermont is likely to lose these species.  Over the next 70 years, under the IPCC B2 scenario 15 bird species native to New Hampshire, New York, and Vermont will experience an average 91 percent decrease in suitable habitat in those states (Ralson and Kirchman 2013).  Habitat for four species - three-toed woodpecker (Picoides dorsalis), black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), gray jay (Perisoreus canadensis), and ruby-crowned kinglet (Regulus calendula) - will become regionally extirpated (Ralson and Kirchman 2013).  Bicknell\u2019s thrush (Catharus bicknelli), a rare migratory bird vulnerable to extinction (Lambert et al. 2008), is expected to decline by over 80 percent (Ralson and KIrchman 2013). In addition to the loss of bird habitat area, aspects of habitat quality including vegetation composition and structure, food availability, predator abundance, and local weather will be affected by climate change (Rodenhouse et al. 2008).  A study of black-throated blue warblers in New Hampshire suggests that climate change will reduce areas of high quality habitat at the bird\u2019s historic nesting altitude (1640-3000 feet above sea level) while extending poorer-quality habitat through higher elevations, resulting in a net lower average habitat quality across the bird\u2019s range (Sillett et al. 2000).  These changes are likely to occur rapidly and will result in smaller populations by decreasing fecundity (Sillett et al. 2000). 5.  Forest Resources and Management Opportunities Vermont\u2019s forests serve as an extremely valuable economic and ecologic resource and are important to our natural and cultural well-being. Our forest products industry is estimated to generate over 1 billion dollars annually (VT Department of Forest, Parks & Recreation 2010). The Vermont forested landscape removes more than 75,000 metric tons of carbon from the atmosphere in a year, valued at $16 million dollars, in addition to providing valuable energy and tourism resources for the state (Vermont Monitoring Cooperative 2009).  Vermont forest managers will increasingly need to adapt their goals and actions as climate change impacts forest conditions.  Managers may proactively reduce forest vulnerability by optimizing forest structure (densities of live and dead trees), changing the mosaic of management on a landscape scale, altering tree species composition, and limiting the potential for and impacts of severe disturbance by controlling invasive species and using controlled burns (Dale et al. 2001).  When disturbances occur, managers may act to facilitate rapid forest recovery (by enhancing structural diversity, planting desirable species and limiting other environmental stressors (Dale et al. 2001).  Finally, in order to develop realistic management goals and plans, forest managers will need to monitor conditions of forests both impacted and not impacted by disturbance, and to watch for interactions among disturbances (Dale et al. 2001).   146  Strategies for mitigating and adapting to climate change impacts in Vermont forests will need to consider the array of human-caused disturbances and the interactions among disturbances. One example is increased parcelization, the division of large tracts of land into smaller ones, is a precursor of fragmentation, the loss of ecological continuity across the landscape as a result of residential and urban development (Haines et al. 2011).   Fragmentation of Vermont\u2019s forests threatens biodiversity and may impact the economics of forest management (Haines et al. 2011).  In 2009 71 percent of Vermont\u2019s landscape was in parcels of 50 acres or larger; however, of those relatively large parcels only 24 percent were classified as forested without dwellings (Fidel et al. 2010).  The number of forest parcels has been increasing by approximately 1,000 parcels a year since 1983, with the greatest increase in the smaller parcel size (1-9 acres) (USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis, Northern Research Station 2008). 5.1 Carbon storage and sequestration Forests are extremely valuable in their ability to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and also store carbon in biomass, soil, and wood products. In 2005, Vermont\u2019s forests almost entirely offset the state\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions (Vermont Forest Resource Plan 2010). In 2011, Vermont\u2019s emission levels were at 8.11 metric tons, surpassing 1990 levels. Although Vermont\u2019s emissions have declined about 10% since 2004, to continue to make a difference in emissions reductions, contiguous forest cover is needed in combination with renewable energy sources. Knowledge of areas with greater amounts of carbon storage, as indicated by the map below (Map 3), will help with management decisions when trying to determine how to protect or restore certain areas and help Vermont work toward some of its future emissions reductions and renewable energy goals. For more information on Vermont\u2019s commitment to renewable energy usage and emissions reductions, refer to the Energy and Policy Chapters.  Threats to forest cover, changes in species composition, and increased pests and pathogens due to climate change will all affect Vermont\u2019s forests\u2019 role in carbon storage. Map 3 shows forested areas of Vermont with the highest amounts of carbon storage. Many of these areas contain species highly vulnerable to climate change (spruce, fir, maple), and are already mapped as potential climate refugia (Figure 6.6).   Figure 6.6 Vermont Aboveground Forest Carbon (W. Seegers, UVM Spatial Analaysis Lab, Vermont Forest Resources Plan 2010).  147  Although productivity of some species may initially increase with increased growing seasons, absorbing more carbon dioxide, multiple studies have shown that older, more stable forest ecosystems store maximum amounts of carbon (Nunery and Keeton 2010). When mortality and decomposition exceed net growth in a forest (when the forest is declining), forests release carbon dioxide. This is another potential issue imposed by climate change induced stresses \u2013 forests could turn into carbon sources instead of sinks. Some areas on Mount Mansfield may already be experiencing this as they suffer from mortality due to drought stress and decreasing biomass (Vermont Monitoring Cooperative 2009).  Vermont has declared that it will reduce its emissions to 50% of 1990 levels by 2028. To do this, the role of forests in carbon storage will need to be increased. It is therefore mandatory to protect forests with high carbon storage and to manage forests with low carbon for increased carbon sequestration and storage. The more we know about current carbon storage and release in Vermont forests, the better we are able to manage Vermont\u2019s carbon budget (Vermont Monitoring Cooperative 2009). The possibility of Vermont entering the carbon market is becoming more imminent as our need to find additional ways to offset and be accountable for greenhouse gas emissions. Domestic and international carbon markets are complex and difficult for a small state like Vermont with many private landowners to participate in, but this may change with time.  148    5.2 Bioenergy Forest management activities produce biomass fuel sources (slash, chip material) that can help to offset greenhouse gas emissions (Vermont Monitoring Cooperative 2009). Bioenergy resources will become more intrinsic to Vermont and the United States as a means to reduce climate change following renewable energy commitments. Currently, four percent of Vermont\u2019s energy usage is from biomass sources, and Vermont is already recognized as a leader in biomass production. Multiple locations around Vermont and at varying scales use biomass generators, ranging from the McNeil Woodchip Plant in Burlington to Middlebury College to home boiler systems and pellet stoves. It may be challenging to balance bioenergy needs with maintaining intact forests for carbon sequestration. Box 6.5 Forest management for maximum carbon storage Sustainable forest management practices are imperative for the future of our forests. Younger forests are sequestering or removing more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than older forests because they have more new growth, but older forests have more wood material to store carbon and act as carbon sinks. What is the optimum forest management practice for maximum carbon uptake? \uf0b7 Maintenance of structural complexity helps with resilience to climate change \u2013 this includes uneven-aged trees, canopy gaps, and trees of different sizes \uf0b7 Passive forest management has proven to achieve the highest amounts of carbon storage (Nunery and Keeton 2010) \uf0b7 Intensified regeneration cutting has proven to reduce net carbon storage (2010) \uf0b7 Disturbance-based forestry practices which promote late-successional forest structure have proven to maintain biomass and carbon storage in northeastern forests (Keeton 2006) \uf0b7 Younger, regenerating forests have the highest rates of atmospheric carbon uptake but forests at later stages in stand development have the highest amounts of overall carbon storage (Nunery and Keeton unpublished)   149  6.  Adaptation and Mitigation Maintaining contiguous forest cover and reducing the conversion of forested land cover is one of the most effective ways to mitigate climate change (Vermont Monitoring Cooperative 2009). Vermont has multiple programs supporting the protection of privately owned forestland, including the Forest Legacy Program (FLP) and the Current Use Program (Use Value Appraisal Program). The FLP is a partnership with the US Forest Service that protects privately owned forestlands from conversion to non-forest uses. The Current Use Program provides landowners with tax incentives to sustainably manage the forest on their property while also agreeing to not develop the land. This program has been Vermont\u2019s most successful forestry and conservation program, maintaining large amounts of forested lands across the state (VT Department of Forest, Parks & Recreation 2010). Maintaining a healthy and diverse forest is also one of the best ways to adapt to the effects of climate change and related disturbances. A variety of tree sizes, ages, and distributions will make a forest more resilient to disturbance and changes in temperature and moisture. As the suitable range of certain species is projected to change, scientists have started mapping locations that might serve as refugia to assist with management strategies. The spruce-fir forest ecosystem in Vermont is one that is currently being focused on, as its habitat is under the greatest threat from climate change, as discussed previously. Map 4 shows areas that offer potential refugia for Vermont\u2019s spruce-fir forests.  Long-term monitoring and research into sustainable forest management approaches are mandatory for forest productivity to adapt to the effects of climate change. Maintaining structural complexity in our forests will help them adapt to future changes brought about by climate change.    Figure 6.6 Vermont spruce-fir forest, potential climate refugia (W. Seegers, UVM Spatial Analysis Lab, VT Department of Forests, Parks & Recreation)   150  7. Summary Table Rating Quality of Information Key Message 1 Increased temperatures will lengthen growing seasons and increase suitable range for certain Vermont tree species like oak and white pine, but decrease suitable range for cold-tolerant species like red spruce and balsam fir. Models project that by the end of the century, an oak-hickory forest could dominate the Northeast with spruce-fir forests being virtually non-existent, and maple-beech-birch forests may persist only in Maine.  Evidence Base: Rustad et al. 2012; Beckage et al. 2013; Betts 2011; Pucko et al. 2011; Wilmot 2011  Assessment of Confidence Based on Evidence: Medium Key Message 2 Alterations in precipitation cycles (wetter winters and extended dry spells in late summer/fall) will place more stress on important tree species such as sugar maple and red spruce, which have already experienced periods of decline in Vermont. Warmer temperatures will result in earlier bud burst and flowering periods for certain species, making them more susceptible to pests and pathogens.   Evidence Base: Vermont Monitoring Cooperative 2009; TetraTech 2013; Rustad et al. 2012; Mohan 2009; Wilmot 2011  Assessment of Confidence Based on Evidence: High Key Message 3 Increases in frequency of natural disturbances as a result of climate change will affect Vermont forest ecosystems and forest cover. Vermont is the third most forested state of the lower 48, with over 4.6 million acres of forest.   Evidence Base: Dale et al. 2001, Schelhaas et al. 2003  Assessment of Confidence Based on Evidence: Medium Key Message 4 Climate change will cause alterations in forest-pest/pathogen dynamics, as warmer temperatures allow for invasive pests and pathogens to expand in numbers and distribution in Vermont\u2019s forests, and high carbon affects physiology of trees, herbivorous insects, and phytophagous pathogens.  Evidence Base:  Brasier 2005, Burdon et al. 2006, Kliejunas et al. 2009, Paradis et al. 2007  Assessment of Confidence Based on Evidence: High Key Message 5 The loss of cold-tolerant boreal forests in Vermont will result in declines in birds including Bicknell\u2019s thrush (Catharus bicknelli), birds that depend on this habitat type.   151  Evidence Base:  Lambert et al. 2008, Ralson and Kirchman 2013, Rodenhouse et al. 2008, Rodenhouse et al. 2009, Sillett et al. 2000  Assessment of Confidence Based on Evidence:  High Key Message 6 Vermont\u2019s forests currently remove approximately 75,000 metric tons of carbon from the atmosphere per year, valued at 16 million dollars. The role of Vermont\u2019s forests in carbon uptake will continue to be of value and potentially increase as pressure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions increases with climate change.

Climate change models project that Vermont\u2019s frost-free period will extend by as much as one month by the end of the century. This extended growing season can increase overall crop productivity and create new crop opportunities such as grapes and peaches. This warming could have a negative impact on agricultural shrubs and fruit trees, such as apple, that need a prolonged winter chilling period into order to initiate the flowering process in the spring. \uf0b7 Climate change models also project greater variations in seasonal temperature and precipitation. Spring time fluctuations could lead to reduced fruit size or frost damage. In addition, excessive soil moisture levels could result in delayed spring planting. During the summer, climate models project more short- and medium-term dry periods for the region. Increased summer dry spells will be occurring at a time when crop water requirements are also increasing due to warmer temperatures.  \uf0b7 Changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide and tropospheric ozone will also impact Vermont\u2019s agriculture. Enhanced atmospheric CO2 promotes photosynthesis, potentially fueling the growth of many Vermont plant varietals. On the other hand, tropospheric ozone is projected to adversely affect the productivity of agricultural crops in Vermont. \uf0b7 For Vermont livestock operations, summer heat stress could lead to decreases in livestock productivity, but most pronounced operational impacts arise from increased feed and energy costs. Climate change impacts on these indirect costs make the industry vulnerable. \uf0b7 The projected higher incidence of extreme weather events can create floods that degrade and inundate farms and livestock operations. If the flooding occurs during the growing season, crops can be lost due to diseases and soil compaction. In addition, extreme weather events can result in damage to planting beds, furrows, ditches, and other agriculture-related infrastructure. \uf0b7 Given the upcoming climate changes, it is essential that Vermont agriculture enterprises develop forward-looking adaptation plans. Farm production programs that address climate change include changing operational timing, investigating new crops and new varietals, increasing cover crop and minimal tillage practices, landscape level farm planning and increasing farm energy efficiency. Some Vermont agricultural endeavors will adapt to climate change more easily depending on farm production practices and location. The overall impact on Vermont livestock and crops will depend on the collective rate of adaptation.     157 \uf0b7 Many greenhouse gas emissions stem from agricultural management choices so agricultural producers can play an active role in greenhouse gas mitigation. Common mitigation areas include improving carbon sequestration in biomass and soils, decreasing fuel/ fertilizer inputs, and reducing methane emissions from livestock production.  \uf0b7 When developing agricultural adaptation and mitigations policies, it is essential to include small to medium sized agricultural enterprises in planning. Small agricultural businesses are particularly vulnerable to climate change due to the physical concentration of assets and limited overall financial resources.   1. Vermont State Agriculture Background Agriculture has always played an important economic and social role in Vermont. Often associated with cows and green rolling hills (Figure 7.1), Vermont has over two-thirds of its population living in areas designated as rural. The agricultural sector employs over 10,500 Vermonters (Dunnington, 2010) and, in 2012, produced close to $700 million in cash receipts (Table 7.1) (United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Economic Research Service, 2012). Vermont\u2019s major agricultural commodities include dairy products, beef, maple syrup, apples, and assorted vegetables. Vermont\u2019s agricultural sector plays an important role in providing  foods that are fresh, high-quality, and local (Wolfe et al., 2008).    2. Overview of Climate Change Elements Influencing Vermont State Agriculture Climate change is altering the Vermont agricultural landscape. Over the next century, climate change models project that Vermont will experience warmer temperatures, variations in seasonal precipitation, increased frequency of weather events, and elevated levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide and tropospheric ozone. Table 7.1: Vermont Agriculture Cash Receipts by Commodity (USDA, Economic Research Service 2012).  Figure 7.1 Holstein Heifer (Wikipedia Commons) Vermont Agriculture2012 Cash Receiptsin 000sDairy Products 500,584$     Cattle and calves 69,935         Maple products 26,625         Vegetables 13,480         Feed crops 13,340         Apples 8,824            All other 66,525         699,313$     From: USDA Vermont Annual Cash Receipts by Commodity    158  2.1 Warmer Temperatures Climate change has already increased the growing season by 3.7 days per decade. The growing season is classified as the length of time between the last spring hard freeze and the first autumn hard freeze (daily minimum temperature drops below 28F). The increase in Vermont\u2019s growing season is visible in Figure 7.2.  Future climate projections indicate a continuation of this trend, with warmer seasonal temperatures resulting in later first autumn frost date and earlier last-spring frost date. This frost-free period extends the growing season by as much as one month by the end of the century (Hayhoe et al., 2007).  2.2 Enhanced Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide  Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide have been steadily rising, from approximately 300 ppm (parts per million) in 1900 to the current atmospheric level of approximately 400 ppm. Research indicates that increasing carbon dioxide modifies the productivity and water fluxes of vegetation.  Crop productivity generally responds positively to increased atmospheric CO2 concentration, but the response depends on the species and local specific environmental conditions. Productivity of many plant varietals may be positively affected by the increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide. (McGrath & Lobell, 2013; Twine et al., 2013) Figure 7.2 Historical Vermont Growing Season at 11 Cooperative Stations in Vermont. The growing season is classified as the length of time between the last spring freeze and the first autumn hard freeze (daily minimum temperature drops below 28F). The graph shows the frost free day average across five decades. In cooperation with the Burlington National Weather Service office, stations were selected based on the length and quality of observation data, taking into account changes in instrumentation and relocation of observation stations.     159 2.3 Elevated Tropospheric Ozone Surface level (tropospheric) ozone is formed when volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide react with oxygen. These pollutants bake together when high temperature is combined with high solar radiation. Exposure to ozone causes visible and physiological damage to plants. Ozone\u2019s effect on vegetation has been examined in controlled greenhouses, open topped chambers, and field crops.  These studies have demonstrated that exposure to ozone reduces plant photosynthesis and growth (Felzer, Cronin, Reilly, Melillo, & Wang, 2007). The various research studies designed to evaluate elevated ozone suggests productivity declines in the range of 5% to 15% among sensitive plants (Booker et al., 2009). It must be noted though that there is considerable genetic variability in plant responses to ozone (Felzer et al., 2007). 2.4 Increased Frequency of Extreme Weather Events  Under all climate change scenarios, extreme precipitation events are expected to occur more frequently (Betts, 2011). These extreme precipitation events can negatively impact production levels by harming growing crops and degrading top soil through erosion. In addition, repeated flooding damages food transportation networks and food system infrastructure located in close proximity to rivers and lakeshores (Dunnington, 2010). 2.5 Variance in Patterns and Amounts of Seasonal Precipitation  Climate change models project overall wetter conditions in the Northeast with total precipitation projected to increase in the spring and winter (Betts, 2011). The rising temperature is expected to result in more frequent short-term water scarcity by the end of the century.  3. Vermont Agriculture Crop Impacts Impending climate changes have the potential to both positively and negatively affect the patterns and productivity of Vermont State crops.       160      3.1 Extended Growing Season and Potential for New Crops  Continuing recent trends (See Figure 7.2), even under low emission scenarios, climate change models predict that the growing season will be extended by one month by the end of the century (Hayhoe et al., 2007). Observations by Ray Allan of Allanholm Farm in South Hero, Vermont, so that apple trees are blooming a full week earlier, on average, than they were when he became Figure 7.3 Vermont State Agriculture- Crop Impact Summary.  The illustration shows projected climate changes positive and negative impacts on Vermont specific agriculture.

The plot highlights the trend of early blooms over the forty year time frame from 1971 to 2011. Data courtesy of Allenholm Farms and NOAA/NWS.     161 proprietor of the farm in 1971. Mr. Allan is also a cooperative observer for the National Weather Service. Warming temperatures can be viewed as an opportunity for crops that require a relatively long growing season such as watermelon, tomatoes, peppers, peaches, and European red wine grape varieties (Wolfe et al., 2008). To capitalize on these opportunities, organizations need to have enough capital to take risks on new crops and develop a market for the new crops (Wolfe et al., 2008). 3.2 Increased Plant Productivity from Enhanced Carbon Dioxide Higher CO2 in atmosphere promotes photosynthesis potentially leading to increased yields in plants (McGrath & Lobell, 2013). Many plants in the Northeast United States are considered part of the C3 photosynthetic pathway. These C3 varieties can demonstrate productivity increases of 20% to 30% when grown at twice current CO2 levels in optimal conditions. These optimal conditions require more fertilizer, ideal temperatures, unrestricted root growth, and control of weeds, insects, and disease (Wolfe et al., 2008). Pasture forage species may experience accelerated metabolism and advanced development with rising temperature, but soil conditions and water availability will constrain carbon dioxides production impacts (Izaurralde, Thomson, Fay, & Morgan, 2011).   3.3 Crop Damage from Seasonal Temperature Fluctuations Vermont climate projections indicate increased spring and fall temperature fluctuations. Warmer temperatures during the reproductive period could reduce fruit or grain size because the rapid rate of development and increased respiration rates (Hatfield et al., 2011). In addition, warm early spring temperatures can lead to early bud-burst or bloom of perennial plants resulting in frost damage with the return of cold winter temperatures (Wolfe et al., 2008)   Some crops in Vermont require exposure to a prolonged winter chilling period into order to initiate the flowering process in the spring. Agricultural shrubs, fruit trees, and winter grain cereals are some of these agricultural crops requiring this winter chilling period. This ensures that reproductive development occurs in the spring and summer rather than autumn. If these chilling requirements are not fulfilled, plant yields will be affected (Wolfe et al., 2008). Some perennial plants, such as apples and blueberries, require 1,000 hours below 45\u00b0F to produce profitable yields (Dunnington, 2010). Under some climate scenarios, southern Vermont winters may not meet these vernalization requirements.   3.4 Increased Moisture Stress and Dry Spells  Vermont horticultural crops (such as melons, sweet corn and tomatoes) are more sensitive than field crops to short-term environmental stresses that affect reproduction, water content, appearance, and flavor quality (Jackson et al., 2011). In addition, excessive soil moisture levels, specifically in the spring, can result in farmers delaying their spring planting. This can have a     162 significant economic consequence since farmers receive a premium for early spring production of horticultural crops such as melon sweet corn and tomatoes (Wolfe et al., 2008).  Although regional climate models indicate more overall precipitation, the rainfall will be concentrated into more extreme precipitation events and skewed towards the winter months. During the summer, climate models project more short- and medium-term dry periods for the region (Wolfe et al., 2008). Increased summer dry spells will be occurring at a time when crop water requirements are also increasing due to warmer temperatures. For some plants, even short dry periods during critical growth and reproduction stages can have profound effects on plant productivity and reproduction (Hayhoe et al., 2007). The relative impact of these dry spells depends on irrigation systems and competing water demands. Grain and silage crops may not bring sufficient profit to warrant investment in irrigation equipment and thus are particularly vulnerable to dry spells. High value horticultural crops may warrant irrigation equipment (McDonald & Girvetz, 2013; Wolfe et al., 2008). Irrigation is covered more fully in the adaptation section. 3.5 Increased Crop Loss from Pests, Weeds and Disease Outbreaks In the realm of weeds, diseases and pests, there will be emergent surprises resulting from departures from current ecological systems. Some Vermont agricultural crops will experience declines in crop production due to increased stress from weed growth, disease outbreaks, and pest infestations. In Vermont, the range of agricultural diseases may expand under changing climate by impacting the host, crop plant, and the pathogen. Host plants may become more susceptible to diseases when they are pushed to the limits of their temperature range and certain pathogens have increased growth rates at higher temperature. Under conditions of climate warming, temperate climate zones (those with cold seasons) are likely to experience longer periods of temperatures suitable for pathogen growth and reproduction. The increased frequency of extreme precipitation events could enhance crop disease risks that need moisture to proliferate, such as potato and tomato blights (caused by Phytophthora infestans) or apple scab which effects apple quality (Petzoldt & Seaman, 2006).  Although less is known regarding climate change and invasive weeds, the completed studies highlight concerns.  Research indicates that some fast growing weed species are especially adapted to utilizing extra carbon dioxide due to differences in the photosynthetic system (Ziska, 2007). Weed species have a greater genetic diversity than most crops. This improves their ability to adapt to upcoming climate variations (Wolfe et al., 2008). Additionally, the range of certain weed species is expanding with increasing temperatures, allowing them to further adapt to new habitat areas (Ziska, 2007). Warmer temperatures and variations in precipitation will increase pest populations with negative productivity implications. Increased temperatures can potentially increase insect population size, expand insect geographic ranges, and result in higher insect overwintering success. In Vermont,     163 pests such as the flea beetle could become more abundant if milder winters encourage their survival. Most research suggests that Vermont farmers will have more types and higher numbers of insects to manage (Petzoldt & Seaman, 2006).  3.6 Increased Soil Erosion and Crop Damage from Extreme Weather Extreme precipitation can create floods that can harm crops and degrade the top soil. Field flooding during the growing season has a multitude of negative consequences. If the flooding occurs during the growing season, crops can be lost due to anoxia or root diseases.  If heavy farm equipment is used on the fields during saturation, the soil is compacted (Wolfe et al., 2008.) Extreme weather events can result in damage to planting beds, furrows, ditches, and other agriculture-related infrastructure (Jackson et al., 2011).    3.7 Decreased Productivity Due to Elevated Ozone Elevated tropospheric ozone is projected to adversely affect the productivity of agricultural crops and tree biomass in Vermont. Studies focused on ozone have demonstrated reduced photosynthesis, growth, and other plant functions (Felzer et al., 2007).  The magnitude of ozone damage varies greatly with crop species and the research community agrees that more specific-varietal research is desirable.  Recent research shows that ozone sensitive plants include livestock forage (such as alfalfa and clover), fruit bushes, grapes, lettuce, potato, spinach, tomato, and watermelon. In addition to production reductions, studies suggest that elevated tropospheric ozone impacts product quality. Potato plants grown in elevated ozone had lower sugar concentration and higher ascorbic acid (Booker et al., 2009).  Although additional research is needed, elevated tropospheric ozone presents a risk to productivity of agricultural crops and tree biomass in Vermont. 4. Vermont Livestock Impacts Vermont\u2019s livestock industry is the backbone of state agriculture, contribute almost 85 percent of total Vermont\u2019s agricultural cash receipts (United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Economic Research Service, 2012). The projected variations in temperatures, seasonal precipitation, and weather events will impact the productivity of this sector. Figure 7.4 Flooded Corn Field, Plank Road in New Haven, Vermont October 2010     164      4.1 Pasture Productivity Many of the agricultural crop implications described earlier in this section directly affect cow and cattle operations through pasture productivity on home grown forage. The warmer temperatures (extended growing season) and enhanced atmospheric carbon dioxide are anticipated to increase field productivity (Hayhoe et al., 2007). Increased weed growth, pest infestations, and seasonal draughts are anticipated to decrease field productivity (Petzoldt & Seaman, 2006; Ziska, 2007). Regarding carbon dioxide effects, the pasture species response is consistent with the general responses of other vegetation including accelerated metabolism and advanced development. Similarly, soil resources and moisture availability will often constrain direct carbon dioxide effects (Izaurralde et al., 2011; Wheeler & Reynolds, 2013).   4.2 Livestock Productivity from Heat Stress Climate change induced warmer temperatures is projected to increase the number of extremely hot days in summer. These extremely hot days (maximum temperatures greater than 90\u00b0F) have an effect on dairy productivity and herd health. Cows are panting animals. So when cows are hot, they pant instead of eating which cuts their overall calorie intake.  This in turn reduces milk yields and slows weight gain in dairy cows. In addition, heat stress lowers the reproductive efficiency in the herd due to the reduction in cow conception.  Without a calf, the dairy cow will not produce milk. In addition to lower milk production, heat stress can increase herd vulnerability to disease.  Many livestock operating factors influence the severity of this heat stress including air velocity, radiation, animal density, and animal insulation (Berman, 2005; Chase, 2006).  Figure 7.5 Vermont State Agriculture- Livestock Impact Summary.  The illustration shows projected climate change positive and negative impacts on Vermont specific agriculture.     165  4.3 Livestock Operating Costs  Dairy and cattle operations profitability is related to their overall operating costs including feed costs and energy costs. Vermont feed costs are not isolated from the global feed and fodder supply chain.  Given global climate change dynamics, economic researchers anticipate substantial risks to the volume and quality of U.S. animal feed supply chains which could potentially drive up prices (Wheeler & Reynolds, 2013). In Vermont, the potential upside from increased growing season could be more than offset by the increased price of off farm livestock feed.  Climate change effects on overall energy prices are comprehensively covered in the Energy Section of this report. [See Chapter 4: Energy] These indirect costs of energy and feed make the Vermont dairy industry vulnerable to climate change. \uf0b7 Box 7.1 Climate Change, Extreme Weather, and Small Business Vulnerability  Small businesses are particularly vulnerable to climate change due to their physical concentration of assets and limited overall financial resources.   In contrast to the greater geographic diversification of larger companies, many small businesses have concentrated consumer markets and physical assets. A single extreme weather event in their location can cripple a small business. The Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety estimates that one in four businesses do not reopen following a major disaster.  (Reynolds, 2013)   In addition, many small enterprises face pressure on the management of their limited financial resources. Climate change increases the year to year variation in temperature and precipitation which can reduce the predictability of many agricultural based businesses.  With limited resource reserves, this yearly boom-and-bust cycling increases small business risk and overall vulnerability.  5. Agricultural Resilience As summarized in sections one through four, climate change will have significant impacts on Vermont agriculture. In light of these changes, this report focuses on both adaptation and mitigation elements under the umbrella of resiliency.   Some Vermont agricultural endeavors will adapt to climate change more easily than to others.  The rate of adaptation will depend on type of farm production and specific farm location. The overall impact on Vermont livestock and crops will depend on the collective rate of mitigation and adaptation. Many greenhouse gas emissions stem from agricultural management choices, so agricultural producers can play an active role in decreasing emissions. Some of the most common areas discussed include carbon sequestration in biomass and soils, decreasing fuel, fertilizers, and pesticides input and reducing methane emissions from livestock production (Grubinger, 2011).      166 6. Farm Production Practices Some farm production programs that address climate change are simply good management practices such as: efficient nitrogen fertilizer and manure use, farm energy efficiency, and cover cropping. Innovative farming practices, such as use of alternative fuels and on-farm energy generation, may address climate change and enhance profitability (Grubinger, 2011).  6.1 Farm Operation Timing.  A central component to successful agricultural adaptation in Vermont is evaluating farm operation timing. Operators must adapt their farm planting and harvesting cycles to address the changing duration of growing seasons.  6.2 Crop Varieties  Crop diversification represents an opportunity. Operators should investigate new crops that require a relatively long growing season such as watermelon, tomatoes, peppers, peaches, and European red wine grape varieties (Wolfe et al., 2008).   For agricultural operations with long winter chill requirements, operators should consider planting new tree cultivars with reduced chilling requirements and adopting new management practices for breaking dormancy in insufficient winter chill years. From a technical perspective, focus needs to be placed on developing new crop varieties, including hybrids, to increase the tolerance and suitability of plants changing climatic condition (Smit & Skinner, 2002).  6.3 Cover Crops, Tillage Management and Green Manure   One of the central components of conservation agriculture is minimizing soil disturbance by tillage or eliminating tillage once the soil is brought to good condition. These alternative tillage practices address moisture and nutrient deficiencies. In addition, maintaining year-round organic matter cover over the soil, including specially introduced cover crops and intercrops retains residues from the previous crop (Kassam, Friedrich, Shaxson, & Pretty, 2009). Cover crops grown primarily to add organic matter to agricultural production soils are called green manure. The legumes such as clover contain nitrogen fixing symbiotic bacteria that fix atmospheric nitrogen in a form that plants can use. These crops are incorporated into the soil while still green performing the vital functions of fertilization and carbon sequestation (Kassam et al., 2009). 6.4 Pest, Disease, Weed and Invasive Species Management With changing climate conditions, the need to monitor for pests, diseases and weed outbreaks is heightened.  \u201cThose farmers who make the best use of the basics of integrated pest management (IPM) such as field monitoring, pest forecasting, recordkeeping, and choosing economically and Figure 7.6 Wine varietals by photographer Gary Weber     167 environmentally sound control measures will be most likely to be successful in dealing with the effects of climate change\u201d (Petzoldt & Seaman, 2006). 6.5 Farm Design and Water Management Some farms may benefit from landscape level analysis to address the moisture deficiencies associated with climate change and reduce the risk of farmland degradation from inundation.  Farm redesign components may include increased setbacks from rivers or lakes in more vulnerable inundation settings or investment in irrigation and water storage.  Conservation buffer strips and riparian corridors help stabilize soils that might be eroded by flooding associated with climate change (Holt-Gim\u00e9nez, 2002; Kominami & Lovell, 2012).  6.6 Energy Efficiency and Farm Based Energy Generation  Given upcoming fossil fuels volatility (Energy Section 4), Crop producers should investigate opportunities to reduce fossil fuel use or increase on-farm energy generation (Wolfe et al., 2008). For marginal lands, farm operations could investigate investment in wind or solar operations in the expanding renewable energy market (Wolfe et al., 2008). 6.7 Hoop Houses and High Tunnels Given the predicted increased variability of spring and fall temperatures, high tunnels (Figure 7.6) and hoop houses are becoming an increasingly important production tool. A high tunnel or hoop house at its simplest form is a non-permanent structure made from greenhouse plastic and a wood or metal frame. These non-heated devices protect the plants\u2019 environment relative to the open field, allowing for earlier or later production of many crops. \u201cProducers, ranging from small-scale market gardens to larger scale farms, are using high tunnels of various forms to produce for early markets, schedule production through extended seasons, grow specialty crops that require some environmental modification, and capture premium prices \u201c (Carey et al., 2009).  7. Livestock Production Practices As described above, animal heat stress lowers overall livestock efficiency. To counter the effects of extreme heat, dairy farm operators can invest in heat management infrastructure. Indoor enhancements include adding sprinkler systems at the feed line, installing fans in interior spaces, and adapting barns to maximize air flow.  Pasture adaptations include adding shade or shelter belts to animal grazing areas (Chase, 2006). Figure 7.7 Image of High Tunnel from Wikimedia Commons     168 Given livestock\u2019s role in global greenhouse gas, reduction in emissions from diary and meat producing operations are a part of many climate mitigation plans. Dairy operations should investigate optimizing cow feed or capturing methane created in manure lagoons to reduce enteric methane (McMichael, Powles, Butler, & Uauy, 2007; Wightman, 2006). Below is information on an ongoing research project at the University of Vermont, Vermont Farm Resilience in a Changing Climate Initiative, which expands on the resiliency information presented above.  This initiative not only evaluates the best practice items outline above, but also provides in-depth evaluations of the climate change resiliency practices, assessing their impact on the economic health of farms, their environmental quality, and their preservation.  8. Summary Table Rating Quality of Information Key Message 1 Climate change is altering the Vermont growing season. Climate change models project that Vermont\u2019s frost-free period will extend by as much as one month by the end of the century. This extended growing season can increase overall crop productivity and create new crop opportunities such as grapes and peaches. This warming could have a negative impact on Box 7.2 Vermont Farm Resilience in a Changing Climate  University of Vermont Participatory-Action-Research collaboration to identify, evaluate and foster implementation on-farm climate change resilience practices. This long-term University of Vermont initiative is a partnership between Vermont farmers, University extensionists, climate and policy scientists, economists, and agroecologists. This group provides in-depth evaluations of climate change mitigation and adaptation practices and assesses their impact on the economic health of farms, their environmental quality, and their preservation. Their goal is to seek to limit the degree of risk that farmers face due to the changing climate. The three-phase project started in 2012 and intends to be a long-term initiative. The collaboration\u2019s research is in the second phase, comprised of on-farm research and focus groups. The on-farm component\u2019s aim is to determine the financial costs and benefits of specific best management practices, as well as measuring the climate change mitigation and/or adaptation potential of each practice. In addition, this second phase involves developing a computer model of land use change to address land use policy, planning and practices in relation to climate change and water quality The third research phase focuses on validating and disseminating results including on-farm workshops. The facilitation of farmer led, on-farm workshops demonstrates targeted and proven best management practices as part of on-farm climate change adaptation and mitigation. Landscape visualization is employed to help farmers and landowners picture how their fields, farms and the Vermont landscape would change under different management scenarios.

New information and remaining uncertainties  Empirical evidence from Vermont farmers (e.g., Allanholm Farm) also shows a change in seasons. More citizen science of this kind could improve our understanding of the impacts of climate change. Assessment of confidence based on evidence Given the evidence base and remaining uncertainties, confidence is very high that climate change is altering Vermont\u2019s growing season.  Key Message 2 Climate change models also project greater variations in seasonal temperature and precipitation. Spring time fluctuations could lead to reduced fruit size or frost damage. In addition, excessive soil moisture levels could result in delayed spring planting. During the summer, climate models project more short- and medium-term dry periods for the region. Increased summer dry spells will be occurring at a time when crop water requirements are also increasing due to warmer temperatures.  Description of evidence base Hayhoe, K., Wake, C.

There remains uncertainty as to when these changes will occur. For example, peaches can over winter in Vermont but do not survive a full decade. Time and more research will tell us when winter temperatures will be sufficiently warm for sustaining peach orchards in Vermont.      170 Assessment of confidence based on evidence Given the evidence base and remaining uncertainties, confidence is high that extremes in weather will continue to increase as climate changes in Vermont.  Key Message 3 Changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide and tropospheric ozone will also impact Vermont\u2019s agriculture. Enhanced atmospheric CO2 promotes photosynthesis, potentially fueling the growth of many Vermont plant varietals.

Policies to reduce ozone formation, such as electric cars and public transportation, could drastically reduce the ozone burden on crops.  Assessment of confidence based on evidence Given the evidence base and remaining uncertainties, confidence is very high that additional CO2 in the atmosphere will boost crop yields and high that surface level ozone will damage crops.   Key Message 4 For Vermont livestock operations, summer heat stress could lead to decreases in livestock productivity, but most pronounced operational impacts arise from increased feed and energy costs. Climate change impacts on these indirect costs make the industry vulnerable.     171 Description of evidence base Berman, A. (2005). Estimates of heat stress relief needs for Holstein dairy cows.

New information and remaining uncertainties  The cost of energy to livestock opperations depends on future energy sources and technology that conserve energy on farms. Analysis of future scenarios of indirect costs to farms would provide more information on vulnerabilities.  Assessment of confidence based on evidence Given the evidence base and remaining uncertainties, confidence is high that climate change will impact indirect costs to Vermont\u2019s livestock operations.    Key Message 5 The projected higher incidence of extreme weather events can create floods that degrade and inundate farms and livestock operations. If the flooding occurs during the growing season, crops can be lost due to diseases and soil compaction. In addition, extreme weather events can result in damage to planting beds, furrows, ditches, and other agriculture-related infrastructure.

New information and remaining uncertainties  Management and policies to project farmlands could mitigate the impacts of extreme events.  Assessment of confidence based on evidence Given the evidence base and remaining uncertainties, confidence is high that increased frequency of extreme weather events will have physical impacts of Vermont farms.   Key Message 6 Given the upcoming climate changes, it is essential that Vermont agriculture enterprises develop forward looking adaptation plans. Farm production programs that address climate change include changing operational timing, investigating new crops and new varietals, increasing cover crop and minimal tillage practices, landscape level farm and increasing farm energy efficiency. Some Vermont agricultural endeavors will adapt to climate change more easily depending on farm production     172 practices and location. The overall impact on Vermont livestock and crops will depend on the collective rate of adaptation. Description of evidence base Chapter 3, this Chapter. New information and remaining uncertainties  The overall impact on Vermont livestock and crops will depend on the collective rate of adaptation. Assessment of confidence based on evidence Given the evidence base and remaining uncertainties, confidence is very high that adaption to climate change will determine the impacts climate change has on Vermont\u2019s farms.   Key Message 7 Many greenhouse gas emissions stem from agricultural management choices so agricultural producers can play an active role in greenhouse gas mitigation. Common mitigation areas include improving carbon sequestration in biomass and soils, decreasing fuel/ fertilizers input, and reducing methane emissions from livestock production.  Description of evidence base Melillo, J. M., et al. (2014). Climate Change Impacts in the United States: The Third National Climate Assessment. Washington, DC, U.S. Global Change Research Program: 841. New information and remaining uncertainties  Innovations, such as biogas capture and use, may reduce emissions from agriculture in the future. Vermont is not a large greenhouse gas emitter and most emissions are from transportation and energy so reductions in agricultural emissions could have a small impact.  Assessment of confidence based on evidence Given the evidence base and remaining uncertainties, confidence is high agricultural producers can help reduce Vermont\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions  Key Message 8 When developing agricultural adaptation and mitigations policies, it is essential to include small to medium sized agricultural enterprises in planning. Small agricultural businesses are particularly vulnerable to climate change due to the physical concentration of assets and limited overall financial resources.    Description of evidence base This Chapter.  New information This risk could be minimized by public and private support, such as grants and loans, extension consultation and such.     173 and remaining uncertainties   Assessment of confidence based on evidence Given the evidence base and remaining uncertainties, confidence is very high that small agricultural businesses are vulnerable to climate change.

However, variability of snowfall from year to year may also increase. \uf0b7 Within 30-40 years, average winter temperatures will have increased to the point that most winter precipitation falls as rain, which will result in shorter lasting snowpack and snowfall, reducing the winter tourism and recreation seasons. This will negatively impact winter-based industries such as skiing, snowmobiling and ice fishing.  Later snowfalls and ice-ups are likely to particularly affect the Christmas/New Year\u2019s holiday tourism season.  \uf0b7 The Vermont alpine ski industry has moved quickly to mitigate and adapt to climate change.  Adaptation activities have focused on expanded artificial snowmaking capabilities and increased year-round recreational opportunities.  In addition, it competes as \u201cgreen\u201d and \u201csustainable\u201d in the regional market.  \uf0b7 Climate change could actually help the Vermont alpine ski industry as more southerly and lower elevation ski areas in other states become unviable. Some projections suggest all 18 remaining ski areas in Vermont will be economically viable through 2075, even under high greenhouse gas emissions scenarios.   Summer: \uf0b7 The summer tourism and recreation season will lengthen, and increased temperatures, combined with high humidity, are expected to drive more tourists to Vermont, presenting an opportunity for summer tourist destinations to expand their activities and businesses.   \uf0b7 Hotter weather with more severe rain events may dampen recreation and tourism activities slightly, but Vermont\u2019s State Parks expect more visitors as a result of climate change, not less. \uf0b7 Water-based recreation (boating, fishing, swimming) may suffer from higher water temperatures, which can increase algal blooms in lakes and reduce populations of cold-water fish (e.g. trout).  On the other hand, warmer waters may improve and lengthen tourists\u2019 summer experience in Vermont\u2019s lakes. \uf0b7 Increased temperatures will encourage expansion of pest species (e.g. ticks and mosquitos), reducing the quality of the recreation experience.       177 Autumn: \uf0b7 The Fall foliage season may start later and last a little longer as leaves remain on the trees longer due to warmer temperatures.  However, the intensity of foliage color may be reduced as frosts come later. Higher temperatures may attract more tourists for the foliage season and harvest-time, particularly those from southern climates, which would be positive for tourism.  \uf0b7 Warmer temperatures will extend the fall recreation season for hiking, biking, boating, camping and hunting, which will have a positive effect on tourism. 1. Introduction Recreation and tourism go together in Vermont.  As stated in the 2001 Benchmark Study of the Economic Impact of Visitor Expenditures on the Vermont Economy (Chmura Economics and Analytics), \u201cTourism-related spending is very dependent on the weather\u201d, which in large part determines recreational opportunities and driving conditions (75% of tourists come to Vermont by car).  While tourism specifically to visit Vermont\u2019s cities and towns is an important part of the economy, the majority of Vermont\u2019s tourism is to enjoy Vermont\u2019s excellent outdoor recreational opportunities.   As climate change affects those recreational opportunities in both positive and negative ways, it can be expected that tourism will rise and fall in a strongly correlated fashion.  Overall, the assessment offered in this chapter suggests that Vermont\u2019s tourism and recreation industries should remain strong, with some seasonal adaptations to be made. Figure 8.1 below shows visitor spending in Vermont by season in 2011.  Out of a total of $1.7 billion, the winter season accounts for 34% ($577 M), the summer season produces 28% ($489 M), fall generates 27% ($460 M), and the spring, just 11% ($193 M). Visitor spending supports an estimated 38,000 jobs for Vermonters (more than 11% of all jobs in Vermont), and contributed $275 million in tax and fee revenues to the State (Chmura, 2011).  Clearly, tourism is a major Figure 8.1 Vermont visitor spending (US$ Millions; left) and Person Trips (Millions; right) in 2011 (Chmura Economics and Analytics 2011).      178 driver of Vermont\u2019s economy and employment opportunities, and considered as the 5th most important industry in the state in terms of employment.  Figure 8.2 shows the number of person-trips by season in 2011.  Out of a total of nearly 14 million person-trips, the summer accounted for the most visits (30%), followed by winter (28%), fall (26%) and spring (17%).    The differences in these seasonal percentages compared to Figure 8.1 is explained by increased spending person during the winter and fall compared to summer and spring (Chmura 2011).  The rest of this chapter examines potential changes in seasonal tourism and recreational opportunities with the exception of spring, which draws relatively few visitors. A variety of methodologies exist for estimating Vermont\u2019s future climate as it affects recreation and tourism, including application of computer models (involving either statistical or dynamical downscaling from models developed to simulate global climate change) and extrapolation from previous observed climate trends.  This chapter adopts the second approach and draws heavily on observations by the National Weather Service in Burlington, Vermont and the work of Alan Betts, specifically \u201cVermont Climate Change Indicators\u201d (published in the journal Weather, Climate and Society, Vol. 3, 2011).  It should be noted that the projections made based on observed historical trends closely match the projections made based on the IPCC-AR4 model, which produced specific scenarios for the Northeastern United States. 2. Winter Tourism and Recreation  Generally speaking, it is expected that both temperatures and precipitation in Vermont will increase due to climate change.  For Vermont\u2019s winter recreation and tourism business, what really matters is how both of these trends interact with the freezing point.  In other words, so long as temperatures remain below 32\u00b0 Fahrenheit (0\u00b0 Celsius), increased precipitation may mean greater snowfall and increased economic activity related to snow-based recreation and tourism.  But once the 32\u00b0 threshold is reached, increased precipitation means increased rain, which can quickly wash away existing snow. Higher elevations are colder, so Vermont\u2019s mountainous areas may benefit from increased snowfall. Furthermore, there is an important positive feedback mechanism between how much snow is on the ground and how cold it is: snow acts to reflect the sun\u2019s rays and maintain cooler temperatures on local scales (the albedo effect).  If snow cover melts, solar reflection decreases, the earth\u2019s surface absorbs more heat and the snow melts further.  Simultaneously, warmer temperatures increase evaporation and atmospheric water vapor, which increases the greenhouse effect at the local scale (increasing downward re-radiation of infrared heat initially radiated off the earth\u2019s surface), further increasing local temperatures (Betts et al, 2014.  Figure 8.3 shows mean temperatures during the winter during the period 1960-2010, which have increased by about 4.5\u00b0 F (2.1\u00b0 C).   While there is considerable variability (more so than in the summer), regression trend lines indicate that winter mean temperatures are increasing by almost 1 degree Fahrenheit per decade (specifically, 0.91\u00b0 \u00b1 0.28\u00b0 F).  This trend over the past 50 years     179 can be considered as likely first estimates for Vermont for the next 40 years, although it is expected that this upward temperature trend will accelerate as the impacts of CO2 emissions over the past 30 years work their way through the global energy cycle lag times into increased air temperatures.   If this is true, winter mean temperatures can be expected to increase by at least another 4\u00b0 F (1.9\u00b0 C) by 2050, with more winter days above the freezing point. Not surprisingly, higher winter mean temperatures have reduced the freeze-period significantly since 1960, as can be seen in Figure 8.4.  Assuming this trend continues, this will result in shortened seasons for skiing, snowmobiling, ice fishing and showshoeing.  While still a long ways off, by the end of the century the average number of reliable snow-covered days in Vermont is expected to decrease to as few as 13-25 days (Frumhoff et al. 2007).  This loss of reflective snow cover will substantially increase winter temperatures. The declining freeze-period is particularly critical for winter sports that rely on natural snow and ice cover (most Vermont ski areas now make large amounts of artificial snow, so long as temperatures permit and there is reliable water access, but this is energy-intensive and costly). In addition, the end-of-year holiday season is very important economically, generating as Figure 8.3. Annual, winter, and summer average temperature change from 1960-2013 for lowland (left) and highland (> 1000 ft; right) climate sites in Vermont. Note the high amount of variability in average winter temperatures. Source: Chapter 1.  Figure 8.4 Decline in the frozen period and lengthening the growing season in Vermont. Source: Chapter 1.      180 much as one-third of a ski resort\u2019s annual revenue (Dunnington, 2011).  A late arriving winter and/or one with more rain or freezing rain in late December/early January could seriously cut into revenues of both ski resorts and the winter hotel industry.  In 2007 a vulnerability assessment of Vermont\u2019s 18 ski areas was carried out (Dawson and Scott, 2007), applying six different climate change scenarios.  It is generally accepted that ski areas need to operate at least 100 days per season to be economically viable, with the most crucial period being the Christmas/New Year holiday period.  Applying these two broad economic risk criteria, only two low\u2010elevation ski areas (Cochran\u2019s and Suicide Six) were considered highly vulnerable to climate change.  However, under all scenarios and for all ski areas, shortened ski seasons and increased snowmaking requirements were projected.  Figure 8.5. Declining frozen period in Vermont. Source: Chapter 1.  Figure 8.6 Contraction of US Northeast ski area under a high emissions scenario (Dawson and Scott 2013)     181 Further analysis of the vulnerability of 103 ski areas in six northeastern states (Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut), was conducted (Dawson and Scott, 2013), applying the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios for low and high carbon emissions.  The four maps shown in Figure 8.6 corresponds to four time periods: 2010, 2010-2039; 2040-2069; 2070-2099.  Under the high emissions scenario and using the same economic viability criteria described above, the authors project a major contraction from 103 to just 30 ski areas by 2075 (35 would survive under the low emissions scenario).  But 18 of those ski areas are projected be in Vermont, which is a very positive sign. The popular Joe\u2019s Pond ice-out observations shown in Figure 8.7 clearly suggest that ice fishing, in particular, will be less accessible in the future.  The ice-out date and time on Joe\u2019s Pond in Danville, Vermont is determined by the moment a cinder block wired to a wooden pallet placed on the ice 100\u2019 out from shore falls into the water.  The block is tethered to an electric clock and when it goes down the clock disconnects, and that is the official \u201cice-out time\u201d.  While perhaps not the most scientific method for measuring declining freeze periods, it is nonetheless reliable observational data that agrees with a longer-term record at Stiles Pond.  The 25-year trend since 1988 is clearly towards earlier ice-out dates, although there is significant variation year to year.  With respect to precipitation, it is more difficult to project than temperature.  But both the global model and observed historical trends anticipate significant increases, by as much as 15% during winter months by 2090 compared to 2000, with large annual variability (Betts, 2011a).  The frequency of heavy precipitation events is also expected to increase; during the period 1958-2007 the amounts of very heavy precipitation increased by 67% in the northeastern United States.  This suggests that future snowfall will increasingly be concentrated in large events, as opposed to more frequent but less bountiful snowstorms.   Figures 8.7-8.11 show trends in precipitation in Vermont during the three-month winter period January-March from 1960-2013.  Figure 8.7 shows the overall statewide trend (increasing by about 0.33\u201d per decade, with increasing annual variability).  Figure 8.8 shows the trend in Northeastern Vermont (increasing by almost 0.50\u201d per decade).  Figure 8.9 shows Western Vermont (increasing by 0.28\u201d per decade).  Figure 8.10 shows Southeastern Vermont (essentially no increase), and Figure 8.11 shows Burlington (increasing by 0.20\u201d per decade).  All figures except that for Southeastern Vermont show both increasing precipitation and increasing variability.   Figure 8.7. Joe\u2019s Pond Ice Out Dates. Source: Chapter 1     182   Figure 8.8. Vermont Precipitation Trends for the 3-month Period, January-March, 1960-2013 (NWS 2014). Figure 8.10. Western Vermont Winter Precipitation Trends, 1960-2013 (NWS 2014). Figure 8.9. Northeastern Vermont Winter Precipitation Trends, 1960-2013 (NWS 2014). Figure 8.11. Southeastern Vermont Winter Precipitation Trends, 1960-2013 (NWS 2014). Figure 8.12. Burlington Vermont Winter Precipitation Trends, 1960-2013 (NWS 2014).     183 Based on observed historical temperature trends in Vermont, winter mean temperatures are projected to remain below the freezing point until at least 2050.  This suggests that over the next 30 years Vermont might benefit from increased overall snowfall (as precipitation increases), particularly in higher elevation mountainous areas, until such time as average increasing winter temperatures convert more of this increased precipitation into rain and freezing rain.  Over the near-term, this could create a \u201csweet spot\u201d for Vermont winter recreation and tourism, as can be observed in Figure 8.13 which shows total winter snowfall (measured in inches) at Mount Mansfield and in Burlington.  The 22% increase at Mount Mansfield over this time period is particularly noteworthy.  Moreover, Vermont\u2019s alpine ski areas have moved aggressively to mitigate and adapt to climate change, in described in the Text Box 8.1 below. Text Box 8:1: Case Study of Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation by the Vermont Ski Industry The Vermont ski industry has moved quickly to both mitigate and adapt to climate change.  In terms of mitigation, the industry has invested millions of dollars in more energy-efficient buildings and snowmaking. According to Ski Vermont (the industry association), these investments have saved more than $26 million in electrical and fossil fuel consumption and prevented over 150,000 tons CO2-e emissions.   Renewable energy generation to power ski lifts and lodges has expanded to include solar, wind and methane digesters (cow manure), although these account for a small percentage of overall energy usage by the ski industry. Increased tree planting (e.g. Jay Peak\u2019s partnership with the Clear Water Carbon Fund) at ski areas increase carbon sequestration and storage, and improve water quality. With respect to adaptation, ski areas have invested tens of millions of dollars in expanded artificial snowmaking and increased grooming capacity to compensate for warmer temperatures and to provide greater predictability for skiers, allowing them to open earlier and close later than they would otherwise with only natural snowfall.  Improved micro-climate weather forecasting allows ski areas to prepare for and respond quickly to changing weather conditions, for example, making snow at optimum times and grooming trails strategically to retain as much snow as possible.    Finally, more and more ski areas are converting into four-season destinations, with golf courses, alpine slides, water parks, music events, car shows, etc.  While winter activities still account for more than 75% of total ski resort revenues, diversification of recreational Figure 8.13 Snowfall in Burlington and Mt. Mansfield 1954-2013.     184 opportunities to year-round operations may make up for losses due to reduced snowfall and/or higher winter temperatures. Vermont\u2019s ski industry is attempting to convert the challenge of climate change into a competitive opportunity, marketing itself as the \u201cgreen\u201d ski state to persuade people who might otherwise ski in Maine, New Hampshire or New York State to come to Vermont.  For example, Stowe Mountain Resort is the first and only ski resort in North America to become a \u201cCertified Sustainable Destination\u201d by Audubon International.  And Killington Resort was awarded the 2013 Golden Eagle for Environmental Excellence from the National Ski Areas Association.  Beyond energy measures, large-scale recycling and composting programs have been established, reducing pressure on landfills, and increasing the overall sustainability of the industry.    More than 15 ski areas in Vermont have obtained some form of certification of sustainability and/or energy efficiency, which is used for branding, advertising and marketing.  Over the next 20 years the expected increased precipitation may increase snowfall and (along with expanded artificial snowmaking) increase the number of skier-days in Vermont.  On the other hand, it may become increasingly difficult to attract potential new skiers to the sport, who might be dissuaded by reports of global warming and/or unable to afford the increased costs of lift tickets due to increased snowmaking and grooming.  The industry will need to continue to respond quickly to the challenge of climate change with even greater mitigation and adaptation measures in the decades ahead. Source: SkiVermont  3. Summer Tourism and Recreation  Climate change is likely to expand summer tourism and recreational opportunities, as the summer season lengthens.  Activities such as camping, hiking, mountain and road biking, fishing, boating and swimming are expected to be available longer for visitors and residents alike.  While summer is already the seasonal leader in terms of the number of person-trips per year (4.2 million out of 14 million, in 2011), climate change is likely to expand this lead further.  And although Figure 8.14. Important Summer Vacation attributes in Vermont (Werneke 2010)     185 per person spending is lower in summer than winter ($118 per person trip versus $149 per person trip in 2011), the quantitative increase in the number of visitors during the Summer may more than offset any decrease in winter visits related to climate change, such that it generates a net gain for the Vermont economy overall.  With respect to Vermont\u2019s State Parks, visitation is driven largely by weather and the school calendar.8  While the school calendar may not be affected by climate change (despite its historical roots in the agricultural calendar), summertime weather will be. Figure 8.14 shows the relative ranking of Vermont attributes explaining why vacationers come to Vermont in the summer (the scale is the relative degree of importance).   Worth noting is that none of the most important attributes are climate-dependent, which suggests that summer tourism should remain quite robust.  On the negative side, warmer water temperatures will result in increased algal blooms in lakes (unless the runoff of phosphorus and nitrogen fertilizers is reduced in the future), and more frequent intense storm events will generate higher rainfall and runoff.  In addition, warmer temperatures are expanding the populations of certain pests in Vermont, which used to thrive only further south, such as ticks causing Lyme Disease.  Increased populations of mosquitos (linked to higher temperatures and precipitation) may also increase the risk of Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) and the West Nile virus.  Certain irritating flora such as poison ivy may also spread more quickly in Vermont as a result of climate change.  All of these risks may lessen the visitor experience and even dissuade visitors from travelling to Vermont in the first place, requiring increased management and adaptation.   On the positive side, higher mean summer temperatures in lower New England states and New York may drive more visitors to Vermont seeking higher elevations and cooler weather.  While Vermont\u2019s summer water quality problems have been well documented in recent reports (see Chapter 5 on Water), overall water quality for swimming, boating and fishing remains very good, as shown in weekly water monitoring in all of Vermont\u2019s State Parks.  Furthermore, the risks related to pests and irritating flora mentioned in the paragraph above are all present in the states most visitors come from to Vermont (Massachusetts, New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, etc.), so many visitors may be well-adapted to them already.    An interesting perspective is that summertime tourism and recreation in Vermont appears to be counter-cyclical to overall economic growth in the country.  It represents a lower cost summer vacation opportunity for many potential visitors (e.g. camping on Burton Island versus a trip to Disneyland), so any large-scale negative economic effects of climate change on potential visitors residing in states south of Vermont  (e.g. another Hurricane Sandy), or simply overall stagnant economic growth, may actually generate positive local-scale economic impacts in Vermont.     Overall, summer tourism and recreation adaptation strategies would include: (i) rehabilitation and expansion of facilities to accommodate more summertime visitors to Vermont\u2019s State Parks                                                           8 Phone conversation with Craig Whipple, Director of Vermont State Parks, October 17, 2013.     186 and tourist sites; (ii) continued careful monitoring of Vermont\u2019s water quality; and (iii) enhanced monitoring and treatment of summertime pests.  4. Fall Tourism and Recreation While the fall season is in third place behind winter and summer in terms of both tourism spending and number of person-trips, it nonetheless represents a very important component of the overall tourism industry.  Vermont\u2019s spectacular fall foliage is a big draw, as is apple-picking, farm visits, hunting and fishing.   Warmer mean temperatures in the fall are likely to attract more visitors to Vermont, who will be able to enjoy outdoor recreational activities longer in the year.    In addition, while the fall foliage colors are primarily determined by changing hours of sunlight, warmer temperatures and increased precipitation may lengthen the time leaves remain on the trees, which could give an additional if minor boost to fall tourism.  On the other hand, warmer temperatures threaten Vermont\u2019s iconic sugar maples with heat stress and pest outbreaks (see Chapter 6 on Forests), which could reduce the quality of fall foliage viewing experience.  Table 8.1 below shows the key outdoor activities for vacationers in Vermont by season.  Most popular fall activities include hiking, camping, fishing, boating, wildlife viewing and biking (road and mountain).   Biking, in particular, is an increasingly popular activity around the country, so it can be expected that biking tourism in Vermont will continue to grow.  In addition, as climate change keeps Vermont\u2019s waters warmer longer, the boating/water sports season will extend, although warmer waters may eventually eliminate cold-water fishing (e.g. lake salmon and trout) activities.  Table 8.1 \u2013 Outdoor Activities in Vermont by Season (Percentage of Vermont Vacationers Surveyed Who Reported They Engaged in This Activity) (Werneke, 2010) Outdoor Activity Winter/Spring Summer/Fall Hiking 25 24 Camping 9 10 Fishing 7 11 Mountain/rock climbing 6 5 Viewing a sporting event 5 4 Adventure games (e.g. paintball) 4 1 Hunting 2 1 Picknicking - 13 Boating/Water Sports - 12 Bird/Wildlife viewing - 10 Road and Mountain biking - 10 Running/Jogging - 6 Golf - 4     187 Tennis - 2 Alpine skiing/Snowboarding 46 - Nordic skiing 6 - Telemark skiing 2 - Snowshoeing 7 - Ice Skating 6 - Ice Fishing 3 - Snowmobiling 6 - Dog Sledding 2 - Other activities 9 7  On the other hand, looking back at the recent past, Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Nicole were both major climatic events, which significantly damaged Vermont\u2019s tourism infrastructure (roads, bridges, etc.) and deterred visitors in both September and October 2011.  To the extent that climate change results in increased frequency of severe weather events in the future, fall tourism and recreational opportunities could suffer.   There is nothing that the tourism and recreation industries can do to prevent these events, but they should be prepared to endure them with less damage and to work with state tourism marketing authorities to encourage vacationers to come to Vermont once the extreme weather has passed.   5. Conclusion The net result of both positive and negative impacts of climate change on Vermont\u2019s tourism and recreation is difficult to project.  While it is difficult to model the natural world, which is subject to physical and biochemical processes, it is even more problematic to model future tourism and recreation because they reflect the social world and less predictable human behavior.   Overall, the outlook is stable.    Table 8.2 provides a sensitivity analysis and illustrates how hypothetical variations (relative to 2011) in tourism visits and revenues by season for 2025 and 2050 could balance out to keep overall revenues steady.  Assuming per trip spending remains constant in real terms and that all variation is with respect to the number of visits in each season, the table indicates the increases in summer and fall tourism required to offset potential declines in winter tourism so that total tourism revenues remain at least at their 2011 levels.           188 Table 8.2: Sensitivity Analysis \u2013Increases in Summer and Fall Tourism Required to Offset Hypothetical Declines in Winter Tourism, 2025 and 2050 (Author\u2019s calculations)   2011 2025 2050  Baseline Revenues ($ M) Variation  Person Trips (M) Revenues (2011$ M) Variation  Person Trips (M) Revenues (2011$ M) Winter 577 -10% 3.5 519 -20% 3.1 461 Summer 489 10% 4.6 537 18% 4.9 576 Fall 460 3% 3.7 471 7% 3.8 489 Spring 193 0% 2.4 193 0% 2.4 193 TOTAL 1719     1720     1720  While purely hypothetical, this rather simple sensitivity analysis suggests Vermont tourism and recreation should remain healthy overall, but that continued adaptation will be required in the decades ahead.  More positively, if winter temperatures remain cold enough so that more of the projected increased precipitation falls as snow, winter tourism might actually increase (rather than decrease as shown in Table 8.2), such that overall tourism and recreation revenues would increase over 2011 levels in real terms.   In any case, as recent Vermont tourism brand research suggests (Werneke, 2010), one-season Vermont vacationers need to be converted to multi-season vacationers, and Vermont\u2019s perceived unique tourism attributes (good value; warm, friendly people; unspoiled landscape; easy to get to) should be increasingly emphasized by the tourism and recreation industries.  6. Summary Table Rating Quality of Information Key Message 1 Over the next two decades, increased wintertime precipitation may increase mountain snowfall levels (so long as temperatures remain below the freezing point), which would have a positive impact on winter-related recreational opportunities and tourism industries (e.g. skiing). Evidence base: Observed temperature and precipitation trends by the National Climatic Data Center of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Organization (www.ncdc.noaa.gov) and the National Weather Service (Burlington, Vermont).   Remaining Uncertainties:  The actual future interaction of projected increased precipitation and temperatures during winter months is uncertain, particularly at different elevation levels.  The projections offered here are based on observed historical trends, not on downscaled climate change computer     189 models.  Furthermore, many winter tourists come from southern New England states and New York. Whether they will come to Vermont for snow-based activities when they have less snow outside their own homes is highly uncertain. Assessment of confidence based on evidence: High Key Message 2 Increased average mean temperatures and increased precipitation over the next 30-40 years will shorten the winter tourism and recreation seasons, with related negative impacts on winter-based industries such as Nordic skiing, snowmobiling and ice fishing.  Later snowfalls and ice-ups are likely to particularly affect the Christmas/New Year\u2019s holiday tourism season.  Evidence base: Observed temperature and precipitation trends by (i) the National Weather Service (Burlington, Vermont); (ii) Betts, A.K., Vermont Climate Change Indicators, Weather, Climate and Society, Vol. 3, 2011; and (iii) Betts, et. al. (2014). Remaining Uncertainties:  Similar to Key Message 1, the actual future interaction of projected increased precipitation and temperature during winter months is uncertain, particularly at different elevation levels.  The projections offered here are based on observed historical trends, not on downscaled climate change computer models.  Furthermore, many winter tourists come from southern New England states and New York. Whether they will come to Vermont for snow-based activities when they have less snow outside their own homes is highly uncertain.  Assessment of confidence based on evidence: Very High Key Message 3 The alpine ski industry has already moved quickly to mitigate and adapt to climate change, competing as \u201cgreen\u201d and \u201csustainable\u201d.    Evidence base: Descriptions of specific ski resort environmental efforts downloaded at www.skivermont.com on October 8, 2013.  Phone conversation with Parker Riehle, CEO, Ski Vermont on October 8, 2013; www.nsaa.org/media, downloaded on November 5, 2013.  Remaining Uncertainties:  It is not clear whether competing as \u201cgreen\u201d and \u201csustainable\u201d in the northeastern ski market will produce benefits in excess of costs.   Vermont\u2019s ski areas have invested large sums of money to adapt to climate change, but future skier behavior (current and potential new skiers) is largely unpredictable.      190 Assessment of confidence based on evidence: Very High Key Message 4 Climate change could actually help the Vermont alpine ski industry as more southerly and lower elevation ski areas in other states become unviable. Projections indicate all 18 remaining ski areas in Vermont will be economically viable through 2075, even under high emissions scenarios.  Evidence base: Dawson and Scott (2013); Observed temperature and precipitation trends by (i) the National Weather Service (Burlington, Vermont) and (ii) Betts et al. (2011a, b). Remaining Uncertainties:  Climate change adaptation by the alpine ski industry is highly dependent on artificial snow-making, which is costly and energy-intensive.  Ski areas pass these increased costs on to skiers in the form of higher prices; if energy prices rise significantly over the medium term (which is a distinct possibility) so will ski resort prices.  It is not clear how continually rising prices will affect overall demand.  In addition, given the broader national discussion regarding climate change, young people may be dissuaded from taking up the sport in the first place because local \u201cbeginner\u201d ski areas in southern New England and New York may become unviable and potential skiers perceive the sport is unsustainable.  Assessment of confidence based on evidence: High Key Message 5 The summer tourism and recreation season will lengthen, and increased temperatures and rainfall further south are expected to drive more tourists to Vermont, presenting an opportunity for summer tourist destinations to expand their activities and business.   Evidence base: Phone conversation with Gregory Gerdel, Chief of Research and Operations for Vermont Tourism and Marketing on October 29, 2013; observed temperature and precipitation trends by (i) the National Weather Service (Burlington, Vermont) and (ii) Betts et al. (2011a, b).  Remaining Uncertainties:  Summer vacationers have many options besides Vermont and their behavior is difficult to predict.  The overall health of the US economy over the medium term is also uncertain; future downturns could be positive or negative for summer tourism in Vermont.   Summertime pests have increased dramatically in recent years but it is not clear (i) if these increases will continue (or if incidence rates will stabilize) and (ii) how this may affect tourism and recreation revenues. Assessment of confidence based on evidence: Very High     191 Key Message 6 Hotter weather with more severe rain events may dampen recreation and tourism activities slightly, but Vermont\u2019s State Parks expect more visitors as a result of climate change, not less.  Evidence base: Phone conversation with Greg Whipple, Director of Vermont State Parks, on October 17, 2013.  Observed temperature and precipitation trends by (i) the National Weather Service (Burlington, Vermont) and (ii) Betts et al. (2011a, b) Remaining Uncertainties:  Similar to Key Message 5, summer vacationers have many options besides Vermont and their behavior is difficult to predict.   Their behavior is also linked to weather and climate conditions in their home states; increased summer temperatures in the metro New York City area may drive more tourists north to Vermont irrespective of increased rainfall patterns.  The overall health of the US economy over the medium term is also uncertain; future downturns could be positive or negative for summer tourism in Vermont.    Assessment of confidence based on evidence: High Key Message 7 Water-based recreation (boating, fishing, swimming) may suffer from higher water temperatures, which can increase algal blooms in lakes and hinder growth of cold-water fish (e.g. trout).  On the other hand, warmer waters may improve and lengthen tourists\u2019 summer experience in Vermont\u2019s lakes.  Evidence base: Phone conversation with Greg Whipple, Director of Vermont State Parks, on October 17, 2013.  Observed temperature and precipitation trends by (i) the National Weather Service (Burlington, Vermont) and (ii) Betts et al. (2011a, b) Remaining Uncertainties:  Algal blooms are closely linked to nutrient run-off.  Numerous efforts are underway to reduce this run-off, particularly in collaboration with Vermont\u2019s agricultural industries.  If this run-off is indeed reduced then increased water temperatures may not result in such blooms and there would be less negative impact on water-based tourism and recreation. Assessment of confidence based on evidence: High Key Message 8 Increased temperatures will encourage expansion of pest species (e.g. ticks and mosquitos), reducing the quality of the recreation experience.  Evidence base: Observed temperature and precipitation trends by (i) the National Weather Service (Burlington, Vermont) and (ii) Betts et al. (2011a, b)     192 Remaining Uncertainties:  Summertime pests have increased dramatically in recent years but it is not clear (i) if these increases will continue (or if incidence rates will stabilize) and (ii) how this may affect future tourism and recreation revenues. Assessment of confidence based on evidence: High Key Message 9 The Fall foliage season may last a little longer as leaves remain on the trees longer due to warmer temperatures.  Higher temperatures may also increase the attractiveness of the foliage season for tourists, particularly those from southern climates, which would be positive for tourism.  Evidence base: Observed temperature and precipitation trends by (i) the National Weather Service (Burlington, Vermont) and (ii) Betts et al. (2011a, b) Remaining Uncertainties:  As the baby boomers age and enter retirement the Fall foliage season and harvest-time may become more popular for tourists but this is not certain.  Later frosts could also reduce the intensity of the Fall foliage colors, which could diminish the attractiveness of foliage-based tourism.  Assessment of confidence based on evidence: Medium Key Message 10 Warmer temperatures will extend the fall recreation season for hiking, biking, boating, camping and hunting, which will have a positive effect on tourism. Evidence base: Phone conversation with Gregory Gerdel, Chief of Research and Operations for Vermont Tourism and Marketing on October 29, 2013; phone conversation with Greg Whipple, Director of Vermont State Parks, on October 17, 2013.  Observed temperature and precipitation trends by (i) the National Weather Service (Burlington, Vermont) and (ii) Betts et al. (2011a, b) Remaining Uncertainties:  Similar to Key Message 9, demographic shifts may favor Fall recreation and tourism, as \u201cbaby boomers/empty nesters\u201d are no longer constricted by the academic school calendar to determine their vacation times and as the increased number of retirees enables more year-round tourism and recreation demand.  Whether this increased demand benefits Vermont or not depends on many variables, some beyond the control of Vermont\u2019s tourism and recreation industries.

Introduction As Vermont\u2019s climate changes, a variety of potential health impacts have begun to arise. Some portions of the State\u2019s population are more vulnerable than others \u2014 children, the elderly, and people who are immune-compromised or who have pre- existing medical conditions or disabilities (IWGCCH, 2010). Lower socioeconomic groups are less likely to have the means to adapt or afford proper healthcare and therefore may also be more vulnerable (IWGCCH, 2010). This raises concerns about climate change\u2019s potential effect on health disparities in Vermont (Frosch, 2009). Workers in agriculture, tourism, manufacturing, construction, metallurgy, and athletics may also experience a disproportionately high amount of effects. 2. Extreme Heat Events Extreme heat events will increase due to increasing temperature (Hayhoe, 2010). Extreme heat will likely lead to heat stroke, heat cramps, heat fainting, heat exhaustion, as well as death (Patz, 2000). Extreme heat can also exacerbate respiratory and cardiovascular diseases such as asthma attacks, heart attacks, and stroke (IWGCCH, 2010). In 2010, 11% of adult Vermonters reported having current asthma and 17% of adult Vermonters reported being diagnosed with asthma at some point in their lifetime. Approximately 55,000 adult Vermonters had asthma in 2010. In 2010, one in 10 children in Vermont had current asthma (VDH Asthma Data Pages 2010). Vermont\u2019s asthma prevalence among adults has been statistically significantly higher (p>0.05) than asthma prevalence among adults for the entire US population (VDH Asthma Data Pages 2010).     196  Figure 9.1. Asthma Prevalence Among Adults. (VDH Asthma Data Pages 2010). 3. Extreme Weather Events Extreme weather events from precipitation variability will increase (Patz, 2000). This includes heavy rainfall events (defined as >2 inches in 48 hours) (UCS, 2006), floods (Betts, 2011, ice storms (Keim & Rock, 2002), winter storms (Keim & Rock, 2002), and wildfires. Extreme weather events have the potential to affect human health in a variety of ways from physical harm and injuries to illness and disease. Extreme weather precipitation events will likely cause injury, drowning, and death (Frumkin, 2008, Patz, 2000). Heavy rainfall and floods as well as short term dry spells can lead to water and food borne infectious diseases (Frumkin, 2008). Wildfires can cause and agitate respiratory diseases (IWGCCH, 2010). 4. UV Radiation and Ozone Depletion Exposure to UV radiation from ozone depletion may increase in duration and intensity (IWGCCH, 2010). This may lead to an increase in skin cancers (squamous, basal, melanoma) as well as cataracts (IWGCCH, 2010). Melanoma is the fifth most common cancer among Vermonters, and between 2006 and 2007 there were approximately 26 deaths a year (Schafrick, 2013). Bennington, Vermont currently has the highest rate of melanoma.  There is a strong correlation between increasing per capita income and melanoma incidence (Schafrick, 2013). Research is still underway but the increasing wealth could mean an increase in outdoor recreation.     197 5. Vector-borne and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases Some tick, mosquito, and rodent vector-borne and zoonotic infectious diseases will increase in transmission (Patz, 2000) due to increasing contact with humans and biting frequency. Expanding geographic ranges, shortening incubation periods and better winter survival from increasing temperature all serve to increase tick and mosquito (and to a lesser extent, rodent) populations. Increasing precipitation may increase mosquito breeding grounds and rodent food supply (Patz, 2000). Drought conditions may cause an increase in mosquito breeding as well by turning rivers into breeding grounds (Patz, 2000). Increased and more resilient tick and mosquito populations will lead to an increase in Lyme disease (Frumhoff, 2007) and West Nile Virus (Soverow, 2009). Increased rodent populations can increase rodent urine, fecal, and saliva-related asthma and viral diseases (Patz, 2000) as well as hanta virus (Patz, 2000). The number of confirmed and probable reported human cases of Lyme disease in Vermont climbed from 105 cases in 2006 to 623 cases in 2011. In 2012, however, the number of confirmed and probable human cases slightly decreased to 522 cases (VDH Lyme Disease Surveillance Report 2012).  Vermont\u2019s northern neighbor, Quebec, began to quantify climate change health impacts. In 2012, West Nile Virus cases tripled, and mortality rates as a result of the disease have been steadily increasing for two decades (Fortin, 2013). Lyme disease became noticeable in Quebec in 2003 and has since increased rapidly with 42 cases in 2012 and 71 in 2013 (Fortin, 2013). Ticks have been observed all over Canada and though the rate of Lyme infection has yet to increase, it is expected to do so (Fortin, 2013). 6. Variation of Seasonal Water Quality and Quantity Seasonal water quality and quantity variation will increase due to increasing water temperature, increasing precipitation and runoff, as well as short term dry spells (Patz, 2000; UCS, 2006). Drinking contaminated water or eating produce irrigated or processed with contaminated water can cause water-borne microbiologic gastrointestinal diseases from viruses, bacteria, and protozoa including Cryptosporidium parvum, Giardia lamblia, Esecherichia coli, and other fecal coliform bacteria. Also, eating seafood (especially shellfish) from contaminated water can cause rare food poisoning from Vibrio vulnificus (Patz, 2000). Contact with or ingestion of contaminated water can lead to blue-green algae bloom-related hepatotoxin and neurotoxin poisoning (Patz, 2000). Contaminated water can also trigger cases of Legionella, which experienced a 217 % increase from 2000 to 2009 in the US (Whitney, 2013). Research is still underway but current hypotheses suspect increased Legionella rates are related to unusual weather from this past summer (Whitney, 2013). In the Netherlands and Philadelphia researchers have found similar Figure 9.2 Cases of Lyme Disease in 2012 in Vermont (VDH Lyme Disease Surveillance Report 2012).     198 cases and potential connections between weather and Legionella instances (Whitney, 2013). Additionally, researchers have found a link between cloud cover and onset the disease, that is peak cases have been observed during sustained cloud cover. This could be due to moisture trapped by low cloud cover causing an increase in outbreaks (Whitney, 2013). 7. Food Production and Quality Changing environmental conditions and water availability will cause disruptions in both food production and quality (IWGCCH, 2010). Chemicals, biotoxins, and pathogenic microbes can lead to seafood contamination (IWGCCH, 2010). Changing use of pesticides in response to changing pest type and distribution may lead to an increase in crop contamination (IWGCCH, 2010). Food-borne illness may increase due to increasing temperature, including food poisoning, campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis (IWGCCH, 2010). Impaired crop growth or changing agricultural practices of production in other U.S. states can cause sub-optimal nutrition and staple crop shortages (such as corn or soy) in Vermont, where we depend on fresh foods and fodder from other states (IWGCCH, 2010). Changes in material and pesticide use in response to climate changes may also be linked to unknown development, neurologic, or cancer effects (IWGCCH, 2010). 8. Increasing aero-allergens, other allergens, and irritants Pollen levels will increase due to longer growing seasons or changing geographic distribution of plant species (Patz, 2000; IWGCCH, 2010). Dust will increase with short term dry spells (IWGCCH, 2010), and increasing precipitation and temperature will lead to an increase in mold and mold spores (IWGCCH, 2010). 9. Adaptation The Vermont Department of Health is already engaged in efforts to adapt to the negative health effects of climate change. These efforts and protocol range from anticipatory and preventative measures to inherently reactive ones. The Vermont Department of Health has put in place early warning protocols to communicate health alerts to the public as well as developing  a Health Alert Network to communicate health alerts to healthcare providers and responders. These serve as a general response to all the previous categories of impacts. 9.1 Adaptation to Extreme Heat and Weather Events The Environmental Public Health Tracking Program provides a record of heart attacks. State-developed reaction protocols relevant to the projected health impacts of climate change in State plans include: The All-Hazards Emergency Preparedness Plan, Emergency Operations Plan (Health Figure 9.3 Lyme Disease in Vermont 2012: Incidence rate of confirmed and probable cases (VDH Lyme Disease Surveillance Report 2012).

Vermont also has a cancer registry. 9.3 Adaptation to Vector-borne and Zoonotic Infectious Disease Public education efforts aim to alert people to the nature and danger of vector borne diseases. The central dead bird reporting line provides a monitoring system for West Nile Virus, and a Sentinel non-human host surveillance deer sera survey provides information on the mosquito-borne Eastern Equine Encephalitis Virus. There is also a reportable diseases surveillance in place and a monthly infectious disease bulletin that provides brief and timely updates about issues of concern in infectious disease epidemiology by the CDC. Vermont is part of the National Electronic Disease Surveillance System. An Early Aberration Reporting System (EARS) reports automated syndrome-sorted data every 24 hours from seven hospitals to the Vermont Department of Health. 9.4 Adaptation to Variation of Seasonal Water Quality and Quantity The State has published guidelines for water testing.  Water test kits are available for purchase for laboratory testing of private water. A Drinking Water Program with an 800 line offers technical advice on protective technologies for microbial or chemical treatments and on interpretation of water test results. Town Health Officers respond to water quality complaints and provide general surveillance and management of water quality in populated areas. In addition to this there is a blue-green algae reporting line and email. The reportable diseases surveillance program is relevant to this impact as well. So is the Early Aberration Reporting System (EARS). 9.5 Adaptation to Aero-allergen and other Allergens and Irritants The Vermont Asthma program conducts surveillance of asthma in the state. Town Health Officers can provide some public education and management of allergens and irritants. 9.6 Adaptation to Food production and Quality Disruption The Food and Lodging Program\u2019s sanitarain inspection and the Shellfish Sanitation Program both provide regulation. The reportable diseases surveillance assists in detection of quality disruptions. The Food and Lodging Program has complaint, outbreak, and recall protocols regarding infectious disease epidemiology. The program also has a sanitarian emergency response plan in place. Vermont\u2019s Birth Defect Registry is the only passive surveillance mechanism relevant to detecting unknown development effects.     200 10.

There is sufficient evidence to suggest these climatic trends will continue through the next century, having negative consequences for Vermont\u2019s transportation infrastructure.   1. Description of Evidence Base In 2008, the Transportation Research Board of the National Academy of Science issued Special Report 290, \u201cThe Potential Impact of Climate Change on US Transportation\u201d (TRB, 2008), which concluded every mode of transportation in every region will be impacted. This report influenced VTrans\u2019 Climate Action Plan (VTrans, 2008), which calls for collaboration between climate scientists, state officials, and universities in adaptive transportation planning. This issue has also been a topic in the Vermont Climate Adaptation White Paper Series and the focus of several scholarly articles. The main climate trends that will impact Vermont\u2019s road, highway, and rail infrastructure are detailed below. 1.1. More frequent extreme heat days:  More days above 90\u00b0F will lead to premature deterioration or failure of infrastructure, including more rapidly degraded pavement, deformed rail lines, and damaged bridge joints, all of which will result in higher maintenance costs (Jollands et al., 2007; TRB, 2008; VTrans, 2008; Peterson et al., 2008; Jaroszweski et al., 2010; Oven et al., 2012; Oslakovic et al., 2012; Chinowsky, 2013; Ebersole, 2013). Periods of extreme heat could also cause increased incidents of vehicle overheating and tire deterioration. Finally, limitations to work days over concerns of worker safety may also become increasingly commonplace (Jollands et al., 2007; TRB, 2008; VTrans, 2008; Peterson et al., 2008; Oslakovic et al., 2012).  1.2. Greater variability of daily temperatures:  Changes in the range of maximum and minimum temperatures will cause an elevated frequency of freeze-thaw cycles in winter months, creating more potholes, deteriorated culverts, frost heaves, and weakened bridge expansions joints (TRB, 2008; VTrans, 2008; Ebersole, 2013).      204 1.3. Greater precipitation and more extreme weather events.  Greater rainfall will cause increased flooding, mudslide, and runoff damage to low lying roads, culverts, bridges, railroads, and other infrastructure (Jollands et al., 2007; Larsen et al., 2008; Peterson et al., 2008; TRB, 2008; VTrans, 2008; Jaroszweski et al., 2010; Oslakovic, 2012; Oven et al., 2012; Erbesole, 2013). Tropical storms reaching Vermont are expected to become more common (VTrans, 2008; Betts, 2011), with more severe flooding in the Champlain Basin, where water levels on Lake Champlain could stand as much as 1-2 ft. higher by 2100 (Stagger and Thill, 2010). Storm events will also cause weather related traffic disruptions and transit delays, and possibly necessitate evacuations during extreme events (Suarez et al., 2005; TRB, 2008; VTrans, 2008).  1.4. More winter precipitation as rain.  When precipitation falls as rain in winter months instead of snow, it leads to immediate runoff and increases the risk of floods, landslides, slope failures, and consequential damage to road and rail, especially in rural areas (UCS, 2007; TRB, 2008; VTrans, 2008; Ebersole, 2013). Elevated soil moisture could also damage roads, bridges, and tunnels. (du Vair et al., 2002; TRB, 2008; Ebersole, 2013).   2. New Information and Remaining Uncertainties:  While there is sufficient evidence of climate change and models to assess how this will impact future weather conditions in the Northeast, more research is needed to better understand Vermont\u2019s climate trends and projections. This inadequacy was addressed in VTrans\u2019 Climate Action Plan. Although some statewide research has been conducted at the state level since 2008, including the Nature Conservancy\u2019s 2010 report: Climate Change in the Champlain Basin (Stagger and Thill, 2010), policy makers continue to seek further supporting evidence. The Climate Action Plan also stressed the need to inventory critical transportation infrastructure to identify locations, weather conditions, and time frames in which projected changes might be consequential. 3.

Student knowledge of earth science lags behind that of biological and physical science.  The Next Generation Science Standards being introduced statewide next year include specific topics on energy, weather, climate and human sustainability.  \uf0b7 Informal climate change education and outreach is offered by a wide range of non-profit organizations, citizens groups and town energy committees, addressing specific issues related to Vermont\u2019s lakes and rivers, forests, wildlife, energy generation, etc. covering both adaptation and mitigation. \uf0b7 Despite these efforts and much progress, there is a long way to go in the use of education and outreach to help Vermonters mitigate and adapt to climate change through changes in their own behavior (energy usage, consumer behavior, voting patterns, etc.).  Combining these education activities with appeals to Vermonters\u2019 values, changes in material incentives, and strengthened social norms could induce more pro-environmental behavior.  1. Introduction Scientists and social scientists have frequently called for increased public education and outreach to induce people to change their attitudes and behaviors related to climate change.  Whether such educational and outreach activities actually do change people\u2019s attitudes and behaviors on their own is disputed in the academic literature.   Review of the evidence (Gardner and Stern, 1996) does indicate, however, that when education and outreach activities are combined with appeals to values, changes in material incentives, and strengthened social norms, pro-environmental behavior can be induced.     207 Concerning the link between education and attitudes, Heberlein (2012) argues that attitudes only change over long time periods and as a result of direct experience and changes in people\u2019s roles and identities, not as a result of education and outreach.  On the other hand, Zsoka et al (2013) argue there is a strong correlation between environmental education and knowledge, which in turn shapes attitudes about sustainable consumption.  With regards to the links between attitudes and behavior, Rodriguez-Barreiro et al (2013) present evidence showing a causal relationship connecting attitudes with pro-environmental behavior.  In addition, Best and Kneip (2011) provide some evidence that environmental attitudes affect environmental behavior, and Erickson (2010) found peer-to-peer education to be quite effective at improving environmental behavior.  Gadenne et al (2011) also found there was a strong association between environmental attitudes and energy-saving behaviors.  On the other hand, Martinsson et al (2011) found that socio-economic factors had a greater impact on energy-saving behavior than environmental attitudes. Significant literature exists on the impacts of education in changing other types of behavior, for example, health-related.  One of the cornerstones of this work is the concept of the stages of change and an individual\u2019s change readiness.  The stages of change include pre-contemplation (no change being considered), contemplation, preparation, action and maintenance (Prochaska, 2001).  Change readiness is defined as an individual\u2019s \u201cbeliefs, attitudes, and intentions regarding the extent to which changes are needed\u2026\u201d (Armenakis et al, 1993).   Education and outreach activities related to climate change are thus intended to increase Vermonters\u2019 change readiness and to move them along these stages of change.   The objective is not just to revise beliefs and attitudes, but also to induce Vermonters to sustainably change their behavior in ways that mitigate and adapt to climate change.  In summary, education and outreach activities may not change environmental attitudes and behaviors in positive ways all by themselves.  It is widely accepted that there is little downside to such activities, and that when combined with other interventions (changes in material incentives, strengthened social norms, and appeals to values), they can be effective (Mirosa, 2013; Stern, 2000; Inglehart, 1990). Furthermore, the risks posed by climate change are sufficiently alarming to warrant expanded education and outreach activities, with the hope that they will increasingly affect attitudes and behaviors in the future, particularly as the risks become more apparent and the public\u2019s direct experiences of climate change increase.   2. Education and Outreach from Vermont State Government Over the past 15 years the State of Vermont has taken a lead role in expanding education and outreach with respect to climate change. The Governor\u2019s Climate Change Commission noted in 1997 that education and outreach was essential for long-term success of all climate change mitigation activities advanced in the State of Vermont. The subsequent Vermont Climate Collaborative (2008-2011) broadened the discussions between the State, academic institutions and public interest groups.  In December 2012 Governor Shumlin signed an Executive Order (No.     208 15-12) establishing a Climate Change Cabinet which has as one of its many responsibilities improving \u201cthe understanding of the effects of climate change in Vermont\u201d and provision of \u201cinformation to Vermonters on all matters relating to a changing Vermont climate, including what to expect in the coming years and actions citizens can take to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases\u201d.   Another task of the climate change team is to \u201ccontinue public outreach to explain climate changes, impact on our future environment, and actions that can be taken to reduce an individual\u2019s and business\u2019s carbon footprint\u201d.    There are many activities underway.  Just to cite a few, a quarterly Climate Change Newsletter is published, covering a wide variety of climate change issues including community impact, climate change policy formulation, emerging science of climate change and new technologies to help Vermonters mitigate and adapt to climate change.  In addition, the State has produced a high-quality 12-minute educational video explaining the basics of climate change science, the potential effects on Vermont and actions to take.  Among many other excellent reports, the State recently published a Climate Change Adaptation Framework, focused on Vermont\u2019s natural resources and the services they provide.9  In summary, unlike some other states, Vermont\u2019s politicians and policymakers from both parties have acknowledged climate change science and the need to develop informed policies and programs designed to mitigate and adapt to climate change. 3. Higher Education  Vermont\u2019s institutions of higher education have also taken a lead role in researching and disseminating knowledge with respect to climate change, both present and future.    For example, the University of Vermont (UVM) was among the very first to emphasize issues of environmental sustainability, with the creation of the Environmental Studies program more than 30 years ago.  Today, led by the Rubenstein School of Environment and Natural Resources, the Gund Institute of Ecological Economics, and other schools of science and applied economics, UVM is recognized nationally for its work on climate change.  In addition, the Vermont State Climatology Office is housed at UVM\u2019s Department of Geography, providing a wide range of climate information to Vermonters, while UVM\u2019s Research on Adaptation to Climate Change (RACC) conducts trans-disciplinary research that integrates the interactions of climate, environment, society and land use policy.  There are many more examples of UVM\u2019s pro-active engagement in conducting education and outreach on climate change issues, which can be found easily on UVM\u2019s website (www.uvm.edu ).  Many other state and private colleges in Vermont have initiated research and education programs related to climate change.  For example, in 1965 Middlebury College became the first                                                           9 Many more education and outreach activities can be found on the State\u2019s website: http://www.anr.state.vt.us/anr/climatechange.      209 college in the nation to establish an environmental studies major, which now includes a focus on climate change, and in 2007 pledged to become carbon neutral (not yet achieved).  It has conducted repeated faculty research symposiums on climate change and in 2013 began a community outreach program to increase awareness of climate change issues among Vermonters.  Middlebury has also expanded its own use of biomass and bio-methane for heat and energy generation, providing opportunities for ongoing research and education regarding renewable energy generation and climate change mitigation.  This led to Middlebury being awarded the Climate Leadership Award in 2013 by Second Nature, a Boston-based national nonprofit that works with college and university leaders to incorporate sustainability in all aspects of higher education, from academics to operations.10  For its part, Bennington College was recognized in 2013 for achieving the highest energy savings of any college or university participating in Efficiency Vermont\u2019s two-year Energy Leadership Challenge. 11  Textbox 11.1 below offers a case study of the efforts of Green Mountain College to mitigate and adapt to climate change, arguably leading the way in expanding education and outreach among all higher education institutions nationwide. Box 11.1: Case Study of Green Mountain College: Green Mountain College (GMC) in Poultney, VT has made Environmental Sustainability its core educational mission.  Every student enrolled is required to complete a 37-credit Environmental Liberal Arts General Education program.  Students have additional opportunities to combine service learning with sustainability, participate in \u201ceco-leagues\u201d and acquire hands-on experience on working farms.   In 2011 GMC became the first college in the United States to achieve carbon neutrality by investing in energy efficiency, adoption of clean renewable energy and purchase of quantifiable local carbon offsets. GMC has a biomass plant that burns locally sourced wood chips to heat 85% and power 20% of the campus\u2019 two dozen buildings, and has sourced 1.2 million KwH per year of bio-methane from cows since 2006.  Going further, GMC has committed itself to meeting 100% of its energy needs through renewable sources by 2020.  Consistent with its mission, GMC voted in 2013 to divest all of its investment holdings in fossil fuel-based companies. GMC is nationally recognized for its leadership in environmental sustainability at the higher education level, and earned a perfect score of 99 for environmentalism in Princeton Education Review\u2019s Guide to Top Colleges for 2014.

For instance, the Vermont Energy Education Program (www.veep.org) provides training and curriculum materials for Vermont teachers on topics of energy efficiency, renewable energy and conventional energy sources.  In 2013 VEEP reached                                                           10 http://www.middlebury.edu/sustainability/node/451698 11 http://www.bennington.edu/newsevents/newsfullstory/13-10-21/Bennington_Honored_for_Sustainability_Practices.aspx     210 more than 3,600 teachers and students in 60 schools (out of a total of 360) around the state, covering about 5% of all Vermont students.   VEEP works with a national program, the Alliance for Climate Education, which has also done several \u201cassemblies\u201d to educate Vermont schoolchildren about climate change.  There are additional national providers of climate change curriculum (e.g. KidWind, NEED and Resource Action Program), but it is not known how many Vermont teachers are using this in their classrooms.  Another Vermont-based example of climate change-related curriculum is the Water Education for Teachers (WET) project (www.projectwet.org), an interdisciplinary K-12 program designed to facilitate and promote awareness, appreciation, knowledge and stewardship of Vermont's water resources, which includes a 500+ page curriculum and activity guide for teachers12.    But what do Vermont students actually know about climate change?  If student learning about Earth and Space Science is roughly equivalent to their knowledge of climate change, than the results of the 2013 statewide science assessment (New England Common Assessment Program, or NECAP) suggest that Vermont students do not know enough.  The NECAP results showed: \uf0b7 In Grade 4, Earth/Space Science scores lagged 11 percentage points behind scores for Physical Science and 5 percentage points behind Life Science scores;  \uf0b7 In Grade 8, Earth/Space Science scores lagged 4 percentage points behind scores for Physical Science and 4 percentage points behind Life Science scores; and \uf0b7 In Grade 11, Earth/Space Science scores exceeded Physical Science scores by 1 percentage point and were equal to Life Science scores. At the very least, these NECAP results indicate that Vermont students know less about climate change than they do about biology, physics or chemistry.  Moving beyond factual knowledge to understanding issues surrounding climate change (which is more complex), we can assume the situation is even less positive.  For example, understanding climate change would typically involve being able to analyze data and use evidence to support a claim or prediction.  Students\u2019 ability to do this is referred to as \u201cinquiry thinking\u201d.  On the 2013 NECAP science assessment, Grade 4 students scored just 29%; Grade 8 students scored 36% and Grade 11 students scored 39%.  These are not encouraging results. On a more positive note, many Vermont schools have included the study of global and local climate change as part of their regular science and social sciences curricula, which is offered at a wide range of grades depending on the school district.  Furthermore, this progress is set to become universal with the implementation statewide of the Next Generation Science Standards in academic year 2014-2015, which includes specific topics regarding energy, weather, climate and human sustainability.13  The Vermont Department of Education and the many teachers who have collaborated with the Department to develop these new standards should be commended                                                           12 (For more information, refer to: www.anr.state.vt.us/site/html/.../climatechangecurriculummaterialslinks.pdf) 13 See for example: http://www.nextgenscience.org/hsess-wc-weather-climate     211 for their excellent work.  The case study in Textbox 11.2 below describes one school\u2019s extremely innovative and exciting effort related to sustainability. Box 11.2: Case Study of The Sustainability Academy, at Lawrence Barnes Elementary School, Burlington, Vermont The Sustainability Academy is the first sustainability-themed public elementary school in the United States.  In this case, sustainability is defined as \u201cthe shared responsibility for improving the quality of life for all \u2013 economically, socially and environmentally \u2013 now and for future generations\u201d.  The school aims to integrate the concepts of sustainability into all aspects of the K-5 school, from the curriculum to campus practices.  Every unit of study in all grades integrates the three pillars of sustainability: economic, equity and environmental, and all grades practice place-based education, service learning and project-based learning.  The school\u2019s success in this regard led to a recent article published in The Atlantic magazine (October 9, 2013).14 The \u201cbig ideas\u201d for sustainability, which the school strives to embrace and teach and which relate perfectly to climate change, include:  - Community   - Systems     - Diversity - Interdependence   - Cycles   - Change over time  - Limits  - Fairness/Equity  - Place    - Ability to make a difference  - Long-term effects  - Equilibrium A wide range of community partners further enrich the learning experiences for students, enabling outdoor education, renewable energy projects, Farm-to-School food programs emphasizing locally-grown good, and other experiential programs.   Shelburne Farms, a non-profit environmental education center, is the core partner, along with private sector partners (e.g. Seventh Generation, The Alpine Ski Shop), higher education institutions (Champlain College and the University of Vermont), and non-profits such as The Intervale Center, Local Motion, Friends of Burlington Gardens, the Community Sailing Center, the YMCA and ReSource. Since the Sustainability Academy was launched 5 years ago, the school has turned around from being a \u201cfailing\u201d school to a magnet school with a waiting list for entrance into kindergarten.  Student attendance and student test scores have improved markedly.

Non-Formal Education and Outreach There are many community-based committees and non-profit organizations that increase public awareness and action regarding climate change issues. For example, the Vermont Energy and Climate Action Network, VECAN helps communities reduce energy costs and climate impacts through conservation, increased energy efficiency and conversion to renewable energy sources, and offers a web-based portal for information on the 92 statewide community energy committees. Efficiency Vermont, operated by the private non-profit Vermont Energy Investment Corporation, provides technical assistance, rebates, and other financial incentives to help Vermont households and businesses reduce their energy costs with energy-efficient equipment, lighting, and approaches to construction and major renovation.  In doing so it increases the public\u2019s understanding of the need to reduce the use of fossil fuels that contribute to climate change. The Energy Action Network and Renewable Energy Vermont are two more examples of non-governmental organizations that aim to bring key stakeholders together to mitigate climate change.   The Vermont Natural Resources Council has long been a voice on issues surrounding environmental sustainability, and in 2013 produced an important report entitled, \u2018\u2019Toward a Resilient State\u201d.  This report explicitly examines how Vermont can both mitigate and adapt to future climate change across a range of areas (energy usage, housing, forests and wildlife, water, etc.), and provides a wide range of perspectives on the issue of resiliency from well-known Vermonters.   In addition, VNRC organizes important conferences related to climate change, such as the Community Energy and Climate Action Conference (December 2013).  VNRC has also teamed up with Efficiency Vermont to promote home weatherization to reduce heating costs and greenhouse gas emissions, in part through expanded education and outreach activities. In the for-profit private sector, Green Mountain Power has teamed up with four Rutland county colleges and the University of Vermont to expand education and outreach related to energy innovation,15 and has established the Renewable Education Center as an outdoor education center featuring a fully functional 50 kilowatt solar farm, wind testing tower, educational signs, and a 2 megawatt hydro station.16  Given the very close relationship between expanded use of renewable energy and mitigation of climate change, these activities by non-governmental entities to expand the public\u2019s knowledge of climate change issues are quite significant.   More generally, the Vermont Businesses for Social Responsibility promotes the shift away from a fossil-fuel based economy toward one entirely driven by renewable energy.  For example, their Business Energy Action program partners with Efficiency Vermont and other agencies to provide technical and financial assistance to businesses to reduce their energy costs, and those businesses that make the most progress receive special publicity and public recognition.  Other private sector firms, such as All-Earth Renewables and SunCommon, provide education, training                                                           15 http://digital.vpr.net/post/green-mountain-power-partners-rutland-colleges-find-future-employees 16 http://www.greenmountainpower.com/community/programs/renewable-education-center/     213 and outreach for how to expand renewable energy generation and distribution by both individuals and companies in Vermont.     6. The Media as Partners in Observing and Communicating Climate Change Indicators Statewide and local media are natural partners in educating the public about localized and regional climate change. The Joe\u2019s Pond Ice Out contest is a terrific example of a simple and fun way to encourage discussion of change that Vermont\u2019s residents (and out-state-people too) can observe and participate in. The two 2014 winners were from Iowa and Massachusetts.  Local constituencies (which might includ  corporate sponsorships tied to media ad buys) might encourage \u201cfirst snowfall,\u201d \u201clast snowfall,\u201d \u201clength of maple season,\u201d \u201cfirst hatch\u201d of important insects, etc. A \u201cBusy as the Bees\u201d contest might find sponsorship based around the first siting of honeybees coming out after a long winter in a locale where pollinators play a vital agricultural role. Birders frequently document the first sitings of migrating species \u2014 and could be encouraged to share information about highly visible and interesting bird species with local radio or TV stations and small-town newspapers. Comparisons of the recorded dates would only be valid over a significant timeframe, but the contests and discussion could educate the public about the correlation between seasonal changes and long-term climate changes.  This report might stimulate interest in examining localized climate events and recording them at schools \u2014 who could provide information over time to local media outlets.  7.Gap Analysis: Additional Education and Outreach Activities needed for Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Despite the many activities described above in expanding education and outreach activities related to climate change, Vermont still has a long ways to go.   There is a large gap between forward-looking state-wide reports and actual public awareness and action. In fact, if one accepts that consumer advertising is an effective form of education and outreach, then the overall balance today remains stacked against climate change mitigation and adaptation.  The repeated exhortations to consume more stuff, purchase more high gas-consumption vehicles, and buy more high carbon-footprint food, in combination with the explicit denial of the science and facts of climate change in some mass media outlets, slow if not reverse the needed behavioral responses to climate change.   A concrete example of where more education and outreach is needed is in the transportation sector, specifically with a goal of persuading more Vermonters to purchase electric or hybrid vehicles to reduce the negative impact of our driving on climate change.  Electrification of Vermont\u2019s vehicles is a key element of the state\u2019s Comprehensive Energy Action Plan, given that     214 transportation makes up 33% of our total energy usage17 and 44% of our greenhouse gas emissions18.  Unfortunately, while registrations of hybrid vehicles grew significantly between 2006-2010, they accounted for just 1% of all vehicles registered (6,335 out of a total of 514,894 vehicles) in 2010.19  In terms of new car buying in 2010, hybrid vehicles comprised just 4% of new vehicle purchases, indicating limited progress and a long ways to go. One outreach strategy would be to appeal more to the values Vermonters hold dear20, such as community, the environment, hard work, self-reliance, small-scale and getting the most out of every dollar.  For example, comparing gasoline expenditures over the 100,000-mile life of a car, driving a Prius (49 mpg) would cost $7,142 (at $3.50/gallon) while driving a regular gas-powered vehicle (22 mpg) would cost $15,909, a savings of more than $8,700 for the Prius owner.  That\u2019s a message that should resonate with frugal Vermonters.  Indeed, every one of these Vermont values has a potential positive behavioral application with respect to climate change that could be encouraged through appropriate education and outreach.    8. Conclusion More education and outreach is needed with respect to the risks posed by climate change for present and future generations of Vermonters, combined with awareness-raising of the potential positive impacts of climate change mitigation and adaptation.   Increased governmental and non-governmental outreach, formal and non-formal education, public service advertising, private sector corporate social responsibility and social marketing programs, etc., are all required to induce the behavioral changes required.   Particularly if education and outreach activities are combined with material incentives and strengthened social norms for pro-environmental behavior, real progress could be made in helping Vermonters mitigate and adapt to climate change.                                                               17http:// www.publicservice.vermont.gov/ downloaded on November 2, 2013. 18 Vermont Agency for Natural Resources, 2007 19 The Vermont Transportation Energy Report: Vermont Clean Cities Coalition, August 2010; and The Vermont Transportation and Energy Report, 2011. 20 These values are eloquently captured in the Council of the Future of Vermont\u2019s 2009 publication, \u201cImagining Vermont: Values and Vision for the Future\u201d, produced by the Vermont Council on Rural Development.      215 9. Summary Table rating quality of information Key Message 1 The Vermont State Government over the past 15 years, and in particular the current Governor\u2019s Office, has taken a lead role in encouraging education and outreach with respect to climate change, in part through the Executive Order establishing the Climate Change Cabinet that defines broad responsibilities for increasing public awareness of climate change issues. Evidence Base:   www.anr.state.vt.us/anr/climatechange/ClimateCabinet.html; Vermont Climate Collaborative (www.uvm.edu/~vtcc/); Remaining Uncertainties:  Effective education and outreach requires Executive and Legislative branch coordination on climate change issues, which is not certain. The Legislature\u2019s willingness to commit necessary public funds to support increased energy efficiency has yet to be demonstrated.  In addition, it is not clear how the Legislature will respond to the policy recommendations provided in the 2013 Renewable Energy Siting Commission report.  Both of these measures include education and outreach components. Assessment of Confidence Based on Evidence: Very High Key Message 2 Vermont\u2019s institutions of higher education have also played lead roles in conducting research and disseminating knowledge to both the scientific community and the public regarding climate change in Vermont and at national and global scales. Evidence Base:  Reports and studies downloaded from websites managed by UVM, Green Mountain College, Middlebury College, Castleton State College, Johnson State College, Bennington College and others. Remaining Uncertainties: Information has not been gathered, much less analyzed, from all of Vermont\u2019s higher education institutions.  It is possible that the colleges not covered by this chapter are far less active in conducting education and outreach related to climate change, which would reduce the overall role played by higher education in expanding public knowledge and awareness of this issue.  Assessment of Confidence Based on Evidence: Very High Key Message 3 The study of climate change is only partially, but increasingly, incorporated into K-12 education programs throughout the state.  Student knowledge of earth science lags behind that of biological and physical science.  The Next Generation Science Standards being introduced statewide next year include specific topics on energy, weather, climate and human sustainability.      216 Evidence Base: http://www.nextgenscience.org/vermont; www.veep.org; www.anr.state.vt.us/site/html/.../climatechangecurriculummaterialslinks.pdf; www.projectwet.org; NECAP science results for 2013 provided by VT Department of Education. Remaining Uncertainties:  Because of resource constraints, there is limited data gathering by the state regarding actual integration of climate change issues into science and social science curricula.  Available information is largely anecdotal.  Vermont teachers\u2019 acceptance and integration of the Next Generation Science Standards (along with the broader Common Core Curriculum) is not certain, and will take considerable time to implement in any case.    Assessment of Confidence Based on Evidence: High Key Message 4 Non-formal climate change education and outreach is offered by a wide variety of community-based committees and non-profit organizations, addressing specific issues related to Vermont\u2019s lakes and rivers, forests, wildlife and energy generation, covering both adaptation and mitigation. Evidence Base: www.vecan.net; www.efficiencyvermont.com; www.eanvt.org; www.revermont.org; www.greenmountainpower.com; www.vnrc.org Remaining Uncertainties:  While the activity and quality of Vermont\u2019s non-governmental organizations working on climate change-related issues is exemplary, the actual level of awareness about climate change among adult Vermonters is unknown.  Including a few questions to address this issue in the annual Vermonters Poll conducted by the Center for Rural Studies at UVM would be illuminating. Assessment of Confidence Based on Evidence: Very High Key Message 5 Despite these efforts and much progress, there is a long way to go in the use of education and outreach to help Vermonters mitigate and adapt to climate change through changes in their own behavior (energy usage, consumer behavior, voting patterns, etc.).  Increased focus on Vermonters\u2019 values and how climate change may affect both present and future generations could be helpful. Evidence Base: www.publicservice.vermont.gov; The Vermont Transportation Energy Report: Vermont Clean Cities Coalition, August 2010; Council of the Future of Vermont\u2019s 2009 publication, \u201cImagining Vermont: Values and Vision for the Future\u201d, produced by the Vermont Council on Rural Development. Remaining Uncertainties:  Whether education and outreach activities can actually include positive behavior with respect to climate change on their own is uncertain and widely debated in the literature.  Given the likelihood of increased extreme     217 weather events related to climate change and people\u2019s perceptions of the associated risks, such activities should become more effective over time but this is conjectural. Assessment of Confidence Based on Evidence: High  CONFIDENCE LEVEL Very High High Medium Low Strong evidence (established theory, multiple sources, consistent results, well-documented and accepted methods, etc.), high consensus  Moderate evidence (several sources, some consistency, methods vary and/or documentation limited, etc.), medium consensus  Suggestive evidence (a few sources, limited consistency, models incomplete, methods emerging, etc.), competing schools of thought  Inconclusive evidence (limited sources, extrapolations, inconsistent findings, poor documentation and/or methods not tested, etc.), disagreement or lack of opinions among experts  10.

Page 6 of 24  Introduction \u201cWe are facing a global climate crisis. It is deepening. We are entering a period of consequences\u201d (Al Gore, speech at National Sierra Club Convention, September 9, 2005). Advocates raising awareness on global climate change almost universally warn of dire consequences for future generations should action not begin now to mitigate the effects of global climate change (see for example Stern, 2007; Garnaut, 2011). However, climate change and its population impacts are not a new phenomenon. Climate has affected human population growth and distribution since prehistoric times (Diamond, 1997). The key difference is that current patterns of global climate change, i.e. those occurring since the industrial revolution, are different from those observed in the past, and are generally accepted as caused by human activity (Hegerl et al., 2007). For instance, the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) notes that \u201cWarming of the climate system is unequivocal, as is now evident from observations of increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice and rising global average sea level\u201d (IPCC, 2007, p.30). The capacity of the earth to deal with such sudden anthropogenic climate change has been questioned (Rockstr\u00f6m et al., 2009). The consequences of global climate change are substantial, and will severely constrain human activity. Agricultural productivity is expected to decline on average (Mendelsohn and Dinar, 2009), leading to increasing global food insecurity (Schmidhuber and Tubeillo, 2007; Hanjra and Qureshi, 2010). Freshwater availability will decline, particularly in glacier- or snowmelt-fed river basins (Kundzewicz et al, 2007; Alcamo et al,. 2007; Hanjra and Qureshi, 2010). Desertification and frequency of drought are expected to increase (Burke et al., 2006; Lioubimtseva and Adams, 2004). At the other extreme, increasing rainfall intensity will lead to more frequent and widespread flood events (Nicholls et al., 2007; Pall et al., 2011), while sea level rise will inundate low lying coastal areas, and increase coastal erosion and salinisation of groundwater (Kundzewicz et al, 2007).  Inevitably, these changes will make some areas less suitable for human habitation, while other areas become relatively more suitable, with consequent impacts on demographic change. However, despite the obvious implications for human systems, to date there has been no dedicated research on the effects of climate change on the population distribution in Aotearoa New Zealand. In 2012, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) contracted NIWA and Landcare Research to undertake a wide-ranging assessment of the impacts of climate change on New Zealand (Rutledge and Tait, 2013). As part of that project, a climate-calibrated regional demographic model of New Zealand is under development. The model will specifically address the lack of quantitative evidence on the demographic impacts of climate change in New Zealand. This paper reports on a review of the international literature on the demographic impacts of climate change, undertaken as part of that  Page 7 of 24  research project, with a particular focus on the likely implications for New Zealand. The paper begins by briefly reviewing the expected effects of climate change on Aotearoa New Zealand, and how climate affects population processes, before looking in turn at possible impacts on fertility, mortality, and migration (internal and international) for Aotearoa New Zealand.  Climate change in Aotearoa New Zealand Mullan et al. (2008) identified and mapped the likely future effects of climate change across Aotearoa New Zealand. Their results were based on General Circulation Model simulations prepared for the IPCC Fourth Assessment (Meehl et al., 2007). Specifically, the results from twelve global climate models were statistically downscaled (Mullan et al., 2001) to provide local spatial detail for New Zealand, along with initial analyses from NIWA\u2019s regional climate models. The results demonstrate that New Zealand temperatures on average are expected to increase by about 1\u00b0C by 2040, and by about 2\u00b0C by 2090. However, these average changes mask significant differences in temperature change at the local level. The greatest increases in average summer temperature are expected to occur in the North Island (and in particular in the central and west of the North Island), while the greatest increases in average winter temperature are expected to occur in the central South Island (Mullan et al., 2008). The models demonstrate a marked increase in the seasonality of rainfall and wind patterns, with increased westerlies in winter and spring, but decreased frequency of westerlies in summer and autumn. Rainfall is expected to increase during winter and spring in the west of both the North and the South Islands, with lower rainfall in the east and north. Conversely, in summer and autumn, there is expected to be drier conditions in the west of the North Island and rainfall increases in the east (Mullan et al., 2008). They also projected increases in the incidence of extreme weather including high temperatures, extreme rainfall, and strong winds, but decreases in frost incidence and snow cover.  Climate change and population processes The changes in local climate outlined in the previous section, as well as the wider changes in global climate, are expected to impact the demographic future for Aotearoa New Zealand. If we want to understand the impacts of climate change on the size and distribution of the future population, we need to recognise the effects climate change will have on population processes. In the simplest sense, the future population relies on three key factors, each of which interacts to determine future population: (1) fertility rates; (2) mortality rates; and (3) net migration (international and internal). Thus, to understand the impact of climate change on future population, we must first understand its  Page 8 of 24  likely impact on each of these three factors. However, before we consider directly the potential impacts of climate change on the factors that determine future population, we must first consider two broader issues. First, climate change is an ongoing and long run process, which leads to an identification problem. For instance, when considering population data it might not be possible to empirically separate the proportion of changes in fertility, mortality, or migration that occurs as a result of changing climate, from changes resulting from other long-run processes such as demographic fertility transitions (particularly in developing countries), increases in life expectancy due to improved infant and youth health or life extension at older ages, or migration due to economic or other factors. Thus, while it may be intuitively appealing to attempt to empirically determine the incremental contribution of climate change to future demographic change, there is likely to be a significant amount of statistical error associated with any such estimates based on past data. These errors will then transfer into projections of demographic parameters that are based on past data and used to project future population. A second, and related, issue is that of uncertainty more generally. Population projections are known to be subject to a great deal of uncertainty (Lutz and Goldstein, 2007), particularly at smaller geographical scales (Cameron and Poot, 2011; Wilson, 2013). Added to this, models of climate change are also subject to a great deal of uncertainty. This uncertainty arises because of uncertainty about future greenhouse gas emissions, the extent and intensity of mitigation efforts, and the impact of new technologies, as well as uncertainty about the effects of emissions on future climate (so-called climate sensitivity) (Visser et al, 2000; Stainforth et al., 2005). Uncertainty about future population will therefore combine uncertainty from both demographic and climate change sources. While these two issues (identification and uncertainty) might give pause for concern about developing population projections, I argue that neither issue is particularly problematic for demographers. In terms of the identification issue, traditional modelling of future fertility, mortality, and migration based on past trends might be sufficient to account for most of the climate-related variation in the near future, since it is likely that climate change is impacting on population change already. Longer-term projections can use projections of demographic parameters that are calibrated to climatic conditions, particularly for sub-national projections. The second issue is also not problematic. The uncertainty in climate projections can be modelled and explicitly described. Thus this uncertainty can be incorporated into population projections in the same way as demographic uncertainty is \u2013 by using probabilistic or stochastic projection techniques (Tuljapurkar, 1992; Cameron and Poot, 2011).     Page 9 of 24  Fertility and mortality The international literature reveals little about changes in fertility as a result of climate change. While global fertility clearly has large implications for future population growth and therefore flow-on effects on carbon emissions and climate change, there is to date no evidence of effects of climate change on the total fertility rate. Philibert et al. (2013) found that climate change influenced conception/birth seasonality in the Kayes region of Mali through changes in rainfall affecting rates of foetal loss (following patterns of change in malaria incidence among pregnant women) and changes in agricultural cycles that affect energy balance and sexual behaviour. In a developed country like New Zealand, where food security for the majority of the population is not associated with agricultural cycles, it seems unlikely that fertility will be affected through these mechanisms. Thus, we can be fairly sure that fertility rates will not be directly affected by climate change. However, if international migration changes the ethnic mix of the population (see below), in-migration of ethnic groups of traditionally higher (or lower) fertility than the current population on average may cause indirect changes in age-specific fertility rates. There are a number of mechanisms through which climate change will affect mortality globally, including cardiovascular and respiratory problems associated with extreme heat (Kalkstein and Greene, 1997), altered transmission of (particularly tropical) infectious diseases (Semenza and Menne, 2009; de Souza et al., 2012), and malnutrition associated with changes in agricultural cycles and food insecurity (Battisti and Naylor, 2009). Heat-related mortality has been shown to follow a J-curve (McMichael et al., 1996), with temperatures at both extremes (hot and cold) are associated with increased morbidity and mortality (Curriero et al., 2002), but with mortality at its highest at high temperatures. The European summer of 2003 provides a recent example that demonstrates the potent effect of extreme heat, as temperatures were approximately 3.5\u00b0C higher than average. The extreme heat resulted in as many as 70,000 heat-related deaths (Robine et al., 2008). Notwithstanding the large absolute number of deaths associated with the heatwave, the crude excess mortality was less than 1.6 deaths per 10,000 population, compared with an underlying crude death rate of about 99 per 10,000 population in 2002 (Eurostat, 2005). This equates to an increase in death rates of about 2 percent. As noted earlier in this paper, the average temperature in New Zealand is expected to rise by about 2\u00b0C by 2090. It is likely that there will be many years in the future where the increase in temperature above the current average will be similar or greater in magnitude to that of the European heatwave in 2003, and so modestly increased mortality rates are likely in those years. However, there also is evidence to suggest that the positive relationship between heat and mortality is declining over time due to adaptation through the use of technology such as air conditioning (Barreca et al., 2012). Thus, we can probably expect a small increase in heat-related deaths to be associated with climate change in New Zealand (see also  Page 10 of 24  Woodward et al., 2001), but the effect on the overall mortality rate is likely to be small. However, age-specific mortality rates will be differentially affected, with heat-related deaths likely to be concentrated among older New Zealanders, particularly older women (Stafoggia et al., 2006), but even these effects may be small. Increased temperatures and rainfall (particularly in spring and summer) are associated with increased reproduction and survival rates of protozoa, bacteria, viruses, and their associated vectors such as mosquitos (Gubler et al., 2001). The incidence of vector-borne diseases, such as malaria (Parham and Michael, 2010), dengue fever (Hopp and Foley, 2003), and Ross River virus (Woodruff et al., 2003), have been shown to be related to changes in climate. These diseases are likely to further spread and increase in incidence through the Pacific due to climate change (Potter, 2008). Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that food-borne infectious diseases such as salmonellosis (Kovats et al., 2004) and campylobacteriosis (Kovats et al., 2005) are related to temperature, and thus incidence of these diseases may also alter with changes in climate. New Zealand is projected to get both hotter and wetter in parts, increasing the suitability of the climate for vector-borne and other infectious diseases (Woodward et al., 2001). For instance, the Foundation for Research, Science and Technology-funded Health Analysis and Information for Action (HAIFA) project found that under the IPCC\u2019s A2 high emissions scenario for 2090, campylobacteriosis would increase by a maximum annual average percentage change of 23%, and seasonal influenza (with vaccination) would decrease by 27% (Baker et al., 2013). Despite relatively large increases in rates of incidence of infectious diseases, actual mortality from these diseases is likely to remain low (see for example Harley et al. (2001) on Ross River Virus). Thus, the impact on mortality rates in New Zealand from climate-induced increases in infectious diseases is also likely to be low, despite the potential for significant increases in morbidity. Finally, as noted previously climate change is likely to affect agricultural productivity, and in aggregate global agricultural output is expected to fall. While New Zealand is currently a large net exporter of agricultural products, and this is expected not to change under even the most extreme climate scenarios (Tait et al., 2008), reductions in availability of food and growing global population are likely to significantly raise the price of food. The combination of rising food prices and decreasing food availability are likely to lead to food insecurity and malnutrition among the poorest in society. However, these factors will also likely lead to reductions in food waste (Godfray et al., 2010). The extent of future food insecurity in New Zealand is difficult to determine, but the implications for mortality rates in New Zealand are likely to be small as the number of deaths in New Zealand attributable to malnutrition is currently negligible,1 and projections for the global burden of malnutrition due to climate change show no significant impact on developed countries at all (Campbell-Lendrum et al., 2003).                                                            1 To the extent that statistics on deaths attributed to ICD-10 codes E40-46 (malnutrition) are not reported by the Ministry of Health.  Page 11 of 24  Migration (international and internal) One of the most widely cited estimates of global climate-induced migration is the 200 million environmental refugees claimed by Myers (2002). Myers\u2019 paper itself provides little in the way of empirical support for this claim, and uses an extremely broad definition of environmental refugees, being \u201cpeople who could no longer gain a secure livelihood in their homelands because of drought, soil erosion, desertification, deforestation and other environmental problems, together with the associated problems of population pressures and profound poverty\u201d (Myers, 2002, 609). Leaving aside for a moment the problems associated with use of the term \u2018refugee\u2019, this definition draws no distinction between internally displaced people and those that migrate internationally, and neither does it distinguish between those who are permanently displaced and those that are temporarily displaced due to extreme weather events such as hurricanes or floods. However, a similar estimate on climate refugee numbers was recently obtained by Biermann and Boas (2010). Both estimates appear to be largely based on estimates of the population exposed to risk, rather than considering the number of people who would actually migrate (Kniveton et al., 2008). Myers\u2019 estimates in particular have been widely criticised (see for example Castles, 2002; Kolmannskog, 2008) and debated in the media and elsewhere, but the fact that they are often accepted at face value (see for example Stern, 2007; Brown, 2008) simply represents a lack of alternative systematic research into the number of climate-induced migrants. This demonstrates the importance of further quantitative research on the migration implications of climate change. Gemenne (2011) reviewed the available estimates of people displaced by environmental change, and noted in particular a number of problems with Myers\u2019 estimates, including: (1) they are a stock, rather than a flow; (2) they do not distinguish between different types of environmental changes as migration drivers and assume that all people displaced in an area affected by environmental changes have been displaced solely because of these changes; and (3) they combine estimates from many other studies, which employ widely varying methods. Gemenne (2011, S48) concluded that existing estimates of people displaced by environmental change \u201clack robust methodological foundations, and are generally grounded in a deterministic perspective, assuming that all people impacted by environmental changes will move away from their homes.\u201d However, these methodological problems are being addressed in more recent quantitative evaluations (for example see Marchiori et al., 2012). The debate outlined above raises a number of important issues, which must be considered before we can interpret the international literature and its implications for New Zealand. First, there is no commonly accepted definition for a climate-induced migrant, with terms such as \u2018environmental refugees\u2019, \u2018environmentally displaced people\u2019, and \u2018climate migrants\u2019, often used interchangeably. The identification of the excess migration that arises due to climate change is complicated by the multi-causal, complex nature of migration, wherein climate change is only one of many drivers of migration  Page 12 of 24  (Black et al., 2011; Barnett and Chamberlain, 2010). Piguet (2010, 517) even goes as far as to claim that: \u201cthere is truly no such thing as a climate or environmental migrant in the narrow sense of a migrant exclusively moving for environmental reasons\u201d. Despite this assertion, it is likely that climate change will affect the migration decision-making process for a large number of people, both now and in the future, and climate change must therefore be taken into consideration when estimating future migration flows. The issue of defining who is and who is not a climate-induced migrant is further complicated by the likelihood that climate change will affect existing drivers of migration, such as by changing agricultural profitability and employment opportunities in rural areas (Government Office for Science, 2011). Furthermore, while climate change might make individuals want to migrate, their ability to migrate may be constrained by legal, political, or economic reasons (Goldin, 2011). This means that the number of actual climate-induced migrants is likely to be significantly smaller than the number of potential climate-induced migrants, i.e. not all people affected by climate change will migrate and thus estimates of climate-induced migration based on exposure to climate change will significantly overstate the true degree of migration. Second, most of the migration flows induced by climate change are likely to be internal (i.e. within national boundaries) rather than international. There are a number of reasons to support this. Currently, most of the world\u2019s migrants are internal rather than international \u2013 according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM) there were 214 million international migrants, compared with 740 million internal migrants in 2010 (IOM, 2011). It is unlikely that there will be a major re-balancing towards international migration in the future. Furthermore, the greatest impacts of climate change on human populations are likely to be felt in the world\u2019s poorest countries (Schneider et al., 2007; World Bank, 2010). In these countries, much of the population is unlikely to have the financial means to migrate internationally, and so international migration flows are likely to be small. Obviously different factors affect climate change-induced international migration from the factors that affect internal migration. International migrants generally need greater financial means because of the larger distances involved, and typically require an established social network in the destination country in order to effectively settle (Carrington et al., 1996; Zhao, 2003). Furthermore, the direction and size of migration flows will likely be determined by prior migration ties between the sending and receiving countries (Adamo and de Sherbinin, 2011). In the New Zealand context, climate-induced international migrants are most likely to originate from low-lying Pacific atolls that are at risk of inundation by sea level rise, more frequent droughts, and tropical cyclones of greater frequency and intensity (Mimura et al., 2007), or similarly affected areas in the major river deltas of South and Southeast Asia such as Bangladesh and Vietnam (Cruz et al., 2007; Ericson et al., 2006). For Pacific countries, New Zealand is an obvious destination choice due to its proximity and the dense  Page 13 of 24  social networks of expatriate Pacific Islanders, particularly in urban centres. However, it is unlikely that all affected Pacific Islanders would migrate to New Zealand. There are similar advantages to re-settlement in Australia, which also boasts large Pasifika communities, and Fiji has offered to re-settle affected Pacific populations (Bedford and Bedford, 2010). Furthermore, it is likely that climate-induced migration will first be accommodated within the islands, in the form of rural-urban migration, rather than international relocation (Campbell et al., 2005; Campbell, 2010). However, the capacity of the islands to accommodate increases in internal migration, particularly to urban centres, has been called into question (Locke, 2009; Hunt, 1996). Currently, permanent and long term migration arrivals into New Zealand from Oceania (excluding Australia) make up about five percent of the total arrivals.2 A substantial incremental increase in arrivals from the Pacific would be required in order to significantly affect the future population of Aotearoa New Zealand. However, this substantial increase may be possible because to date, most migration to New Zealand has been from smaller Pacific countries such as Samoa and Tonga while the migration flows from populous Melanesian countries such as Papua New Guinea have been much smaller. However, as the impacts of climate change are increasingly felt in these more populous countries, migration flows can be expected to increase (Moore and Smith, 1995). Thus, the numbers of international migrants from the Pacific to New Zealand in the future is likely to grow as a result of climate change, and may increase as a proportion of total in-migration if migration from Papua New Guinea (in particular) increases. For non-Pacific-Island countries, distance and the associated cost of travel ensure that only relatively wealthy migrants will have the resources necessary to migrate to New Zealand. This includes large numbers of potentially environmentally displaced people in Asia. Despite the rhetoric that labels climate-induced migrants as \u2018environmental refugees\u2019 (e.g. see Myers, 2002), climate change is not recognised as one of the factors that defines a refugee under international agreements such as the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees 1951 (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), 2008). Thus, New Zealand is not obliged under these agreements to accept \u2018environmental refugees\u2019 (Burson, 2010). Furthermore, New Zealand currently restricts the conditions under which potential migrants may gain residency (Burson, 2010). Thus without a lowering of the threshold for residency, the impacts of climate change outside of the Pacific Islands are unlikely to induce substantial additional migration flows into New Zealand. Climate-induced international migration is likely to also affect other demographic characteristics of the New Zealand population. The countries most likely to contribute in-migrants to New Zealand as a result of climate change currently have both higher total fertility rates and higher mortality rates than                                                           2 Based on Statistics New Zealand permanent and long-term migration data, there were 87,778 permanent and long term arrivals in the year ended May 2013. Of these, 4207 (4.8%) originated from Oceania (excluding Australia). Similarly, arrivals from Oceania (excluding Australia) totalled 4309 of 83,789 (5.1%) in the year ended May 2012, and 4299 of 83,781 (5.1%) in the year ended May 2011.  Page 14 of 24  New Zealand. These fertility and mortality differences between migrants and the current population have flow-on implications for the future New Zealand population. For example, it takes time for migrants to assimilate and adopt similar fertility patterns to the local population (Ford, 1990).  Internal migration is not affected by the legal barriers noted above, and is much less costly for potential migrants. The effects of climate change differ substantially between the North and South Islands, as noted earlier in this paper. Differences in small-area climate have been shown in international studies to affect internal migration flows (Barrios et al., 2006; Barbieri et al., 2010). For example, Poston et al. (2009) demonstrated that temperature, humidity, but not wind were related to inter-state migration rates in the United States between 1995 and 2000, and concluded that climate acts more as a pull factor than a push factor for migration. Thus, in addition to present long-term trends in population movement from the South Island to the North Island and from rural areas to urban centres, we can expect to see small but significant climate-induced internal migration effects as changes in local climate affect the relative attractiveness of the different regions. As well as international and internal migration, at the small area level there is likely to be a redistribution of population away from vulnerable coastal and flood plain areas. According to McGranahan et al. (2007), about 13 percent of the population in New Zealand and Australia currently resides in vulnerable low elevation coastal zones. However, it seems likely that most of the population at risk of sea level rise will either adapt in situ, or migrate within the local area. Thus the impact of these changes is unlikely to be dramatic except at the localised level in coastal and low-lying areas. Summary and future research directions Climate change is likely to have profound impacts, both globally and locally in Aotearoa New Zealand. However, to date there has been no systematic evaluation of the likely impacts of climate change on demographic change in New Zealand. The review presented in this paper demonstrates that climate change is unlikely to greatly affect fertility rates, and will likely have a small but significant effect on mortality rates. The effect on international migration will largely depend on future government policy with respect to in-migration, but regardless migration from the Pacific will likely increase, both in absolute terms and as a proportion of total migration. Changes in the pattern of internal migration are also likely, as climate change will differentially affect the various regions in New Zealand. As noted in the introduction, this paper marks the beginning of a four-year MBIE-funded project investigating the impacts and implications of climate change for New Zealand. As part of that project, a climate-calibrated regional demographic model is currently under development. The model is based on a standard cohort-component method, with parameters that are calibrated to account for past and future changes in climate variables, including both average and extreme climate variables (e.g. average daily temperature, and the number of days where temperature exceeds certain values). The  Page 15 of 24  relationship between all-cause mortality by region and climate variables is being investigated in order to better incorporate climate-related changes in mortality rates. Gravity models incorporating climate variables at both the inter-regional level (for internal migration) and international level (for international migration) are under development. The inclusion of climate-calibrated parameters in the demographic model addresses the identification issues noted earlier in this paper. The model can also be extended to a stochastic model, following Cameron and Poot (2011), to incorporate both climate and demographic uncertainty. The final model will be integrated into a coupled human-environmental systems model to determine the future impacts and implications of climate change for Aotearoa New Zealand (Rutledge and Tait, 2013).

Introduction\nAgriculture is one of the most climate dependent human activities, as it is highly sensitive to\ndifferent hydro-climatic conditions, such as rising of temperature and changes in rainfall. Myanmar,\nas an agricultural based country, is prone to the adverse effects of climate change. According to\nAsian Disaster Preparedness Centre (ADPC), it has the highest economic vulnerability (EV) to climate\nchange in Asia [1]. In terms of agro-climatic conditions, Myanmar is a diverse country that exhibits\ndifferent challenges [2,3]. Historical climatic data show that temperatures are increasing and the\nlength of the wet season and monsoon intensity are decreasing, while rainfall has also become more\nClimate 2020, 8, 9; doi:10.3390/cli8010009 www.mdpi.com/journal/climate\nClimate 2020, 8, 9 2 of 15\nerratic. Although climate change impacts on agriculture can already be witnessed, they are likely to\nbe aggravated in the future [1,4]. Myanmar will remain one of the most vulnerable countries [2\u20135],\ngiven the projected changes in extreme weather and climate events, agricultural productivity loss,\nand sea-level rise.\nThe Central Dry Zone (CDZ) of Myanmar occupies two-thirds of the agricultural land in Myanmar.\nThe agricultural productivity of this region is crucial for the country, as the agricultural sector alone\ncontributes nearly 40% to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), making the CDZ an important region\nfor national planning. However, increasing droughts and rising temperatures are clearly affecting\nagriculture in CDZ [6\u201310]. Understanding the vulnerability of the agricultural sector to exogenous\npressures is important in the development of agriculture and rural areas for the policy makers and\ndevelopment planners. Notwithstanding the importance of the region, the understanding of the\nmagnitude of the impacts of climate change on agriculture in the CDZ is still limited. In the light of the\nchanging climate, Myanmar lacks detailed estimates of climate change and the impacts on agriculture.\nTherefore, this study estimates the climatic and non-climatic determinants of farm profitability on farm\nhouseholds in the CDZ and assesses the projected impacts of climate change (changes in precipitation\nand temperature normal) on agricultural performance while using a Ricardian model. The paper is\nstructured, as follows. Section 2 gives an overview of the agricultural system and observed changes\nin climate in the CDZ, Section 3 reviews the agro-ecological features of the sample districts/regions\nand Section 4 reviews the data types and methodologies. Section 5 discusses the results and Section 6\nconcludes and suggests policy options.\n2. Observed Climate Change Patterns and an Overview of Agriculture in CDZ\nThe population of the CDZ is approximately 16 million. The region is subdivided in three regions\nor states: Magwe, Mandalay, and Sagaing [10]. The CDZ is situated in the middle of Myanmar and it\nis part of the central inner Myanmar basin and lowland area. It is located between 19 and 23\u25e6 N and\nbetween 94 and 96\u25e6 E. While the CDZ is typically dry, the wide range of soil types, geomorphology,\nvegetation types, water balance, and human activities makes it a diversified zone. The region has\nan arid to semi-arid climate. The Bago Yoma Mountain range creates a monsoon\u2019 rainfall shadow.\nSeasonal water scarcity is reported to be the primary challenge for the dry zone region [9,11]. The CDZ\nreceives limited rainfall (500\u2013900 mm) with an unpredictable spatial and temporal variation when\ncompared to country averages (2353 mm). Temperature can be as high as 43 \u25e6C, with April and May\nbeing the hottest months. The highest mean temperature is around 32 \u25e6C and the range between the\nmaximum and minimum temperature is 15 \u25e6C [2,3,9,11].\nThe production of oil crops, pulses, and rice dominate the agricultural system in the dry\nzone [2,11]. According to Matsuda [12], crop productivity in the dry zone region suffers from the high\nvariation in rainfall. Moreover, the high temperatures reduce the yields of the most important crops.\nOther constraints to crop production reported include the traditional farming practices, poor quality\nseeds, lack of investments in inputs and their use (fertilizer, pesticide, fungicide dosages), and uncertain\ncrop prices [6\u20138,11]. The ongoing adverse changes in precipitation patterns increase the likelihood of\ncrop failures and decrease farm revenues and the incomes of farmers [6,7,13]. As a coping strategy\nfor crop failure farmers in the region typically diversify their agricultural production. Most of the\nfarmers are smallholder subsistence farmers. Approximately 37% of farmers own less than four acres\nof land [9,14].\n3. Agro-Ecological Features of the Sampled Districts/Regions\nThree agro-ecological zones can be identified based on the type of land (upland or lowland)\nand the access to irrigation: a zone with intensively farmed croplands with access to irrigation all\nseason, a zone with croplands with access to supplementary irrigation and river beds, and a zone with\nrain-fed production, including both upland and low-land and extensive rain-fed upland agriculture [9].\nClimate 2020, 8, 9 3 of 15\nThere are three main cropping seasons: summer crop, monsoon crop, and post monsoon crop or\nwinter crop.\nThe characteristics for the dry zone are the clay and sandy soils with high risks of water shortage\nand wind erosion lead to land degradation and a decline in agricultural production [6,7]. The soil types\nand rainfall patterns are not conducive to rice cultivation in CDZ, especially in the Magwe region.\nHowever, rice is cultivated under irrigation in the Sagaing region. In the CDZ, agriculture is the main\nlivelihood and income generating activity for households. Approximately 11.74 million peoples out of\nthe 16 million of the CDZ live in rural areas and their livelihoods mainly rely on agriculture [10]. A large\nproportion of the rural population depends on agriculture for their incomes, employments, and food\nsecurity. With water availability being their main constraint, farmers normally practices deep tillage,\nmanure application, and mulching in order to maximize the water storage during rainfall periods.\n4. Research Methodology\n4.1. Data\nAs mentioned above, a cross-sectional survey was conducted in 16 Townships, which cover five\ndistricts and three regions (Sagaing, Mandalay and Magwe) in 2016 to quantify the potential impacts\nof climate change on agriculture in the CDZ (see Figure 1). This study uses the mean temperatures of\nthe different regions of CDZ. This study uses the mean temperatures in different seasons because it is\nimportant to capture the effects of temperature at different key times (three seasons) in the production\ncycle for farmers. There are three seasons in Myanmar; summer, winter, and monsoon season. Moreover,\nthis study uses the average precipitation and temperature from the past 30 years. These climate\ndata are checked with climate data from regional meteorological departments in the dry zone and\nadditional weighting of these climate data was carried out, so that the data variation of the average\nmean temperature and precipitation are reduced. All precipitation and temperature variables are\nexpressed by the differences in means across the 30 years of data to ensure that the linear and quadratic\nterms are not collinear, see also [15]. In addition, projected climate data were also acquired from the\nWorld Bank data web portal. Following the three cropping seasons (summer, monsoon, and winter),\nthe strategy of using rainfall averages at each single month permits a more throughout reflection of\naccumulation of precipitation in soils over a period. Similar to the precipitation, the temperature at key\ntimes in the production cycle is important for farmers, and the mean temperatures at each single month\nare taken into account. The summer season goes from February\u2013May, while monsoon is normally from\nJune-September, and winter is from October\u2013January. Linear and quadratic terms are included since\nclimate variables could have non-linear impacts on net revenues, as in [16,17].\nIt was observed that there is a significant variation in temperature across the different geographic\nlocations of the Dry Zone. An independent variable that represented the effect of different seasonal\nrainfall patterns across the year was fitted in our model. This will avoid any serious serial correlation\nin the independent variables and it will be an effective measure to capture the precipitation effects\nrelative to using a monthly mean.\nIn addition, this study combines household data with data on long-term climate normals.\nThe structured interviews looked at socioeconomic characteristics, climate change adaptation measures,\nand institutional characteristics. The interview was carried out face-to-face. At the village-tracts\nlevel, the sample villages were randomly chosen and, within the villages the respondents, were also\nrandomly selected. In total, 425 complete questionnaires were obtained. The socioeconomic and\ndemographic characteristics of farm households and crop production data were collected. Moreover,\nsecondary data, such as land use data, and production data of major crops from the Department of\nAgriculture were also acquired.\nClimate 2020, 8, 9 4 of 15\nClimate 2020, 8, x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 15 \n \nFigure 1. Map of the Dry Zone region in Central Myanmar (Source: Myanmar Information \nManagement Unit). \nIn addition, this study combines household data with data on long-term climate normals. The \nstructured interviews looked at socioeconomic characteristics, climate change adaptation measures, \nand institutional characteristics. The interview was carried out face-to-face. At the village-tracts level, \nthe sample villages were randomly chosen and, within the villages the respondents, were also \nrandomly selected. In total, 425 complete questionnaires were obtained. The socioeconomic and \ndemographic characteristics of farm households and crop production data were collected. Moreover, \nsecondary data, such as land use data, and production data of major crops from the Department of \nAgriculture were also acquired.  \nThe farmer\u2019s fixed costs (i.e., non- cash cost), such as owned cattle and manure cost, their seed \nstorage, and family labor costs were considered, and variable costs (i.e., cash cost), such as hired \ncattle, farm-machines and labor cost, purchased manure, fertilizer, and pesticide costs, were included \nin the total farmers costs for production and calculated on a hectare basic. Net revenues per hectare \nare calculated as the difference between revenues and costs, divided by the number of hectares \nfarmed, see more [15]. Other socioeconomic characteristics of farmers, such as having draught \nanimals, access to irrigation facilities, farm size, and size of households, and distance to market \n(accessible), were also considered. In the interview with farmers, units that prevailed in the country \nand region were used and the conversion rate (equivalents in SI units) are shown, as follows: one ac \n= 0.405 ha, one basket of husked rice = 34 kg, one basket of sesame = 24.5 kg, one basket of pigeon \npeas = 32.7 kg, and one basket of other pulses (green gram) = 31.3 kg, see also [18]. The current \nexchange rate of Myanmar Kyat (MMK) was approximately 1 $ (United State Dollars) = 1250\u20131300 \nMMK during the surveying period. A production function approach was used to generate the crop \nrevenues of farmers. The reference period for the production data analysis was captured as one-year \n6 townships in \nSagaing region \n6 townships in \nMandalay region \n4 townships in \nMagwe region \nFigure 1.

Theory: Ricardian Analysis\nIn this study, a hedonic approach, known as the Ricardian approach, was used to estimate the\nmarginal effect of various climatic, economic, and other factors on farmland values. This approach\nis also known as a duality approach, because it examines the relationship between agricultural land\nvalues and climate data [16,20\u201322]. The traditional Ricardian approach has two key assumptions:\nfirst, there is a long run equilibrium in factor markets (especially land), but, secondly, there are no\nadjustment costs, such that land rents fully reflect the value of climate at any given location [23].\nMendelsohn et al. [16] proved that the Ricardian approach could be developed with individual farm\ndata and with district-level data. A lot of research has been carried out while using Ricardian models\nat the district or regional level [20,21,24,25]. Like other studies, such as Sanghi [26], Kumar and\nParikh [27], Kurukulasuriya and Ajwad [15], and Mendelsohn et al. [28], the annual net revenue per\nhectare is used for representing the agricultural land values, as data on land prices were not available\nin Myanmar. This study assumes that the net revenue per hectare depends on climate and a number of\nexogenous determinants.\nNR =\n\u222b\nPLE e\u221dt d t =\n\u222b\n{\n\u2211\nPi \u2212 Qi(X, F, M, G) \u2212R.X}e\u221dt dt\nwhere: PLE is the net revenue per hectare, (t) is the time, and (\u221d) is the discount rate. We assume that\nthe net revenue per hectare, (PLE) depends upon (Pi), the market price of crop (i), (Qi) the output of\ncrop (i), (R), a vector of input prices, and (X), a vector of purchased inputs (other than land). The crop\nClimate 2020, 8, 9 6 of 15\noutput, (Qi), is in turn a function of the purchased input (X); a vector of climate variables (F), a vector\nof labor (M), and a set of farm characteristics (G), such as market access, livestock asset, and irrigation\naccess, etc. Therefore, the net revenue per hectare depends upon the market price of the crop, the crop\noutput, and a vector of input prices and purchased inputs.\nThis study assumed that farmers make a series of production choices that aimed at maximizing\nprofit at the farm level. Farm households, however, are price takers and, hence, individual farmers\nhave no impact on market prices [15]. Thus, the estimated specification of net revenues per hectare can\nbe written as:\nPLE = \u03b20 + \u03b21F+ \u03b22G+ \u03b23M+ \u03b5\nwhere, (\u03b2i) are estimated coefficients, (\u03b5) is the unexplained portion that is assumed to be independent\nand identically distributed. As said by Kurukulasuriya and Ajwad [15], the potential change in farm\nprofitability due to changes in climate can be estimated as the difference between the changes in net\nrevenues per hectare evaluated with the climate variables set to those before the climate change (PbLE)\nand after the climate change (PaLE).\nIn an econometric assessment of the impacts of climate change, the parameter and modeling\nmethods are very uncertain. Blanc [29] pointed that a limiting assumption is that estimates are based\non past events, which will continue in the future. In addition, the limitations of this approach are\nthat it explicitly examines crop and farmer responses to climate, as well as implicitly assuming the\nbiophysical and economic adjustments that are imposed by climate change [20]. Thus, studies using a\nRicardian analyses need to be carefully evaluated for robustness [20\u201322,25]. For instance, it is not based\non controlled experiments across farms and does not usually fully include all non-climatic factors (soil\nquality, market access, and solar radiation, etc.) in the model [20,21,24,25]. In addition, the Ricardian\nmodel captures the manner in which farmers adjust to climate change over decades, not year by year,\nand, thus, we assume that the predictions are a snapshot of the long run profits [19].\nIn addition, Kurukulasuriya and Mendelsohn [30] mentioned that technology variables also need\nto be carefully evaluated in the model. The access to electricity and irrigation could increase the farm\nnet revenue and reflect either higher technology or better access to market. In this study, the irrigation\ncosts were not counted in the net revenues, but an irrigation dummy was considered for the analysis.\nThe reason is that the utilization of irrigation water in Myanmar is normally free of charge as provided\nby the government [31]. However, the costs that were related to fertilizer and compost application of\neach individual farm\u2019 households were considered and used in the model. The effects of these strategies\non crop net revenue were carefully integrated and calibrated in the model for policy purposes because\nthe farm households can take these decisions individually as climate change adaptation strategies [21].\nThe Ricardian technique also considers the adaptations as implicit and endogenous and it assumes\nthat each farmer maximizes net revenue subject to the exogenous conditions of the farm [16].\nHowever, this study does not consider future technology changes and changes in the future\nadaptation strategies following changing climate conditions. In addition, this analysis does not take\nextreme climate change events into account [21]. Moreover, the Ricardian model does not reflect price\neffects, and it does not take changes in output and input prices that result from the global changes in\nproduction and that might affect farm-level adaptation decisions into account [15,16,32,33]. Therefore,\nprices are kept constant in the model [15,24,34]. In addition, this study assumed that the only thing\nthat changes in the future is climate, mostly in forecasting climate change impacts. Although many\nother things, such as population, technologies, institutional conditions, and reliance on agriculture\nand livestock, will change over the century [21,35], this study does not account for these changes in\nthe future. One of the key assumptions of this method is that farm revenue per hectare is sensitive\nto climate and a set of exogenous determinants. In this study, it is assumed that climate change will\ndecrease the major crop\u2019s yields, which, in turn, will reduce the mean income of the farm households.\nHowever, one key assumption is that the return over investment (cost) of the sampled farmers at a\ngiven price was considerably similar in all cases of each crop production. However, in this study,\nthe number of diversified crops of the farm\u2019 households were objectively considered and interviewed\nClimate 2020, 8, 9 7 of 15\nand, thus, the farm incomes were separately included. Therefore, the data represents the agricultural\nland values and the model reflects the economic impacts of climate change on agriculture in the CDZ.\n5. The Regression Results\nTable 1 presents the basic summary statistics of the dataset for the relevant variables of the study.\nThe average age of the household head is above 47 years and more than 65 % of the respondents have\nfollowed secondary education. Households cultivate approximately 3.56 hectares of land and about\n77% of the farmers reported to receive irrigation water. The average distance to the market is about\n9.23 miles. Moreover, the data show that roughly about 78% of the farmers use draught cattle for\ncultivation, which means that the majority of the farmers are cultivating crops in a traditional way.\nIn addition, above 80% of those farms apply compost and manure. Compost and manure are usually\nby-products of livestock or crop production. The average household counts five people.\nTable 1.

Table 2 presents the resulted findings.\nThe table shows the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimates of the determinants of net revenues per\nhectare while using two models. Model 1 only take the marginal impacts of the seasonal temperature\nand precipitation on farm net revenues into account, while model 2 also considers the socioeconomic\ncharacteristics of farm households and farm-level adaptation measures. In Model 2, we exclude the\ninsignificant and collinearity associated seasonal temperature and precipitation measures from the\nmodel 1. We find that the R2 was about triple from 0.15 when climate and socioeconomic characteristics\nof farm household are used as in model 2, and thus the inclusion of the socioeconomic characteristics\nis jointly significant and the model has strong explanatory power. Model 3 was additionally regressed\nfor the parsimonious estimation from the model 2. The test shows that the model was significant at the\n1% level. Kurukulasuriya and Ajwad [15] mentioned that demeaning the climate variables does not\ncorrect for the multicollinearity that is associated with the linear and quadratic variables. Therefore,\nClimate 2020, 8, 9 8 of 15\nthis study has followed the concepts on the Ricardian technique and the literature on the determinants\non farm net revenues.\nTable 2.

The coefficients that resulted from model 2\nwere used to estimate the marginal impacts of global warming on net revenues (see Table 2). Increasing\ntemperature in all seasons marginally decreases the crop revenue per ha, while increases in precipitation\nin all seasons might lead to slight decreases or increases of crop revenue per ha. Therefore, the OLS\nmodel implies that increases in temperature are generally harmful in all regions, but increases in\nrainfall are basically beneficial, although changes of rainfall in the winter season would be harmful to\ncrop production.\nIn this study, a non-linear relationship between climate and net crop revenue is found, which is\nconsistent with the available literature [16,30,36]. In addition to the climate variables, this study has\nfound many interesting results that are related to farmers\u2019 characteristics. Most of the household\nvariables have a significant impact on crop revenue. The size of the cropping areas negatively affects\ncrop net revenues, as the estimated coefficient of crop area suggests that there are increasing returns to\nscale in farm size. This could be due to the fact that smallholder farmers with less than one hectare\nof land dominate the agriculture in the dry zone [6,7]. In addition, shortage of farm land is one of\nthe barriers to the uptake of climate change adaptation strategies in the dry zone of Myanmar [37].\nA similar result is observed in Kurukulasuriya and Ajwad [15] who stated that households that cultivate\nClimate 2020, 8, 9 9 of 15\na single crop are less profitable than households that plant multiple crops. Nevertheless, the quadric\nterm of size of the cropping area is likely to positively affect crop net revenue.\nThis study also considers the household head\u2019s education. This could be seen as a proxy for the\nability of the households to adopt new technologies, and climate change adaptation measures that\nare available at the farm-level. Farmers with middle school education have higher net crop revenue\nper hectare than the farmers with a lower education level. It seems like farmers with middle school\neducation are more likely to adopt new technologies for the purpose of maximizing farm\u2019 productivity.\nHowever, this study did not directly consider the effect of the level education on the adoption of\nnew technologies at the farm-level. In addition, this study does not consider information about the\nfarmer\u2019s experience and its effects on farm productivity. However, the age of the household head\nwas considered as a variable in the model. This study found that age of the household head affects\ncrop revenues in the setting of changing social and environmental conditions. The finding suggests\nthat an increase in age of household head is negatively affecting net revenue, but the relation was not\nsignificant. In addition, no significant relation was found for the effects of the gender variable (men\nheaded household). In Myanmar, household members substitute paid labor on the farm. Interestingly,\nthis study did not find an effect of household size on farm profitability, as the available data do not\nshow a significant impact on net revenues. The distance to the market from the farm location is\nalso negative, but is insignificantly related with crop revenue. The quadric term of distance to the\nmarket is negatively affects net revenues, but the effects seem to be small. Nevertheless, investing in\ninfrastructure development, such as road, is strongly recommended in the dry zone of Myanmar, as it\nwas also indicated in the findings of Belton et al. [19].\nWith the use of draught cattle and compost and manure has a positive and significant influence\non net revenues. Draught cattle help farmers in land preparation processes and enables farmers to\ngrow crops timely. The application of compost and manure (and green straw) is one of the climate\nchange adaptation measures of farm household in the region. It has a large and positive effect on the\nnet revenues of farm\u2019 household in the study areas. The application of compost and manure improves\nthe soil fertility and structure and, therefore, increases crop productivity [38]. In the dry zone region,\naccess to dam irrigation rapidly increased since the mid-1970s. With irrigation, farmers have the\npotential to obtain more income from farming [19]. This study also finds that farms with access to dam\nirrigation have significantly higher net revenues. The results indicate that farms with access to irrigation\nwater are more profitable than farms that only relied on rain-fed agriculture. Rain-fed agriculture is\nless profitable and, thus, productivity will even decrease in the changing climatic conditions in the\nregion. Under such conditions, access to irrigation water could enable farmers to avoid the risks that\nare related to water scarcity at the farm and reduce the negative effects of increasing temperatures and\ndrought on crop net revenues. Therefore, investing in irrigation development and infrastructure could\nenable farm households to grow more crops and to obtain more income from farming.\nPredications of Forecasted Climate Scenario on Net Farm Revenue ($ per ha)\nThis study uses climate scenarios that are specific to Myanmar to analyze the impact on farm\nprofitability (see Table 3). The future climate change scenarios may have a significant effect on the\ncropping patterns and crop productivity in the CDZ. Table 4 shows the effects of predicted changes\nof temperature and precipitation on the net crop revenue per hectare (marginal value changes) over\nthe forecasted scenarios and Table 5 presents the estimated percentage changes. In this section,\nthe stimulated impacts of climate change projections for the Dry Zone of Myanmar were estimated.\nAs mentioned above, three climate change projection scenarios were used to stimulate the impacts\nof climate change on Dry Zone\u2019 agriculture in Myanmar: the PCM, CGCM3, and CSIRO scenarios.\nThe A2 emission scenario was used. Each model predict the temperature and precipitation until 2100,\nassuming that greenhouse gas emissions continue unabated [15]. The likely impact of climate change\non economic or biophysical systems was analyzed by using future climate change scenarios from\nclimate change models [20,22,30]. In this study, future net revenues are calculated by multiplying\nClimate 2020, 8, 9 10 of 15\nthe climate coefficients by the future climate. The previous analysis suggests that temperature and\nprecipitation have different effects on the net revenues in the Dry Zone.\nTable 3.

A significant\nmarginal impact of increasing temperature on the net revenue of farm households was observed.\nThus, using the PCM climate model suggests that increasing temperatures will affect farm households\nin the CDZ. If the temperature increases 2\u20134 \u25e6C during the period 2060\u20132100, the likely impacts of\nincreasing temperature on crop net revenue will range from \u221218% to \u221235%. In the PCM climate model,\nprecipitation is projected to increase until 2070. However, precipitation is predicted to decrease again in\nthe last 20 years of the century (2080\u20132100), especially in the summer and winter seasons. In the winter\nseason, the crop net revenues could increase by 1.5% to 4.5% in the first period, but decreases of 5% to\n25% in crop net revenue are also expected during the period 2060\u20132100. As stated by Kurukulasuriya\nand Mendelsohn [30], climate change is not likely to be uniform with some areas getting dryer and\nother wetter. This study indicates that the climate change scenarios by the PCM model were not\nuniform. However, the PCM scenarios are relatively mild when compared to other climate scenarios,\nsuch as CGCM3 and CSIRO.\nIn addition, the results from the CGCM3 climate model point out that increasing temperature\nwill have impacts on crop revenue of farmers in CDZ. However, temperature is predicted to slightly\ndecrease in the first quarter of the century, but it will increase again afterwards. Until 2050, there will be\nnot much change in net revenue, but a significant impact of increasing temperature on net revenue of\nfarm households in the last 40 years of century (2060\u20132100) was observed while using projections of the\nCGCM3 climate model. According to the data resulting from the CGCM3 climate model, the negative\nimpacts on crop revenue by increasing temperatures range from 15% to 42%. Positive net revenues of\ncrops were observed by the projected increase in rainfall in winter season. However, a negative impact\nof projected changes in the precipitation on crop net revenue was observed in summer (ranging from\n5% to 28%) and monsoon seasons (ranging from 3.6% to 10%). These predictions more or less show the\nmagnitude and direction of future impacts on agriculture [20,24,30].\nThe CSIRO climate model was additionally formulated for understanding the trends and potential\nimpacts of a changing climate on crop revenues of farmers in CDZ. Temperature is predicted to be\nstable until 2040, but it is projected to increase after that until 2100. Again, there will not be many\nchanges in net revenue until 2050, but a significant impact of increasing temperatures on net revenue of\nfarm households in the last 50 years of century was observed when using the CSIRO climate projections.\nThe CSIRO climate model projects the monsoon precipitation to increase until 2100. However, there will\nnot be much fluctuation in the precipitation in the winter and summer seasons. Farmers are expected\nto receive positive net revenue from farming, due to the changes in precipitation in the summer\nand winter season. In the monsoon season, a slightly negative impact on net revenue is predicted,\nwith changes from 4.3% to 16%. However, farm households will have a lower crop net revenue in all\nseasons and changes are expected from 7.52% to 46% because of the projected changes in temperature.\nTherefore, all of the models show that climate change will have serious impacts on crop production in\nthe CDZ.\n6. Conclusions and Recommendations\nThis study examines the effects of climate change in different regions in the Dry Zone of Myanmar\non crop production, based on a cross-sectional analysis. The empirical results from this study showed\nthat the net revenue per hectare was sensitive to marginal changes in climate variables (temperature\nand precipitation). The estimated coefficients from the OLS model were presented to show the effects\nof climate change variables and farm\u2019 household characteristics on crop net revenue. The prediction\nof the impact of climate change on crop production is just an estimation of what would likely be the\nimpact on the economy of farm households, but it is not a prediction of what may actually occur in the\nfuture. The crop net revenues per hectare of farm households in the CDZ were changed along with the\nmarginal changes in climate variables (temperature and precipitation). The results from the regression\nanalysis reveal that improving access to dam irrigation is necessary for the farmers to cultivate crops in\nhard climatic conditions. Therefore, it is also recommended to invest in the development of irrigation\nClimate 2020, 8, 9 13 of 15\nfacilities in the region, so that irrigation water can be utilized from the purpose of development\nof agriculture and rural areas. Moreover, improving access to markets would lessen the negative\nimpacts of climate change on agriculture. In addition, the application of recommended climate change\nadaptation strategies, such as systemic utilization of manure or compost, could lead to an increase in\ncrop revenues.\nThe marginal effects of climate change on crop revenues suggest that climate change might have\nvery different effects on different farmers in CDZ. Predictions from the three global circulation models\nconfirm that global warming will have a substantial impact on the net crop revenue in the dry zone of\nMyanmar. Overall, this paper suggests that there is a large range of impacts on agriculture in CDZ.\nHowever, these results may be relatively biased by our net revenue specification, in which assumptions\nwere made regarding constant prices or full adaptation, or that does not take into account annual capital\ncost, and family labor costs. In addition, the Ricardian model is not suited to identify the perceptions\nof farmers on current climate conditions and their adoption of climate change adaptation strategies\nin the future, as well as policy interventions and, thus, this study cannot predict if the agriculture in\nCDZ of Myanmar might be changed in the near or mid-terms in the future. However, our study has\nprovided empirical based research findings from the perspective of climate change impact assessment\non farm incomes in dry zone of Myanmar. We can conclude that prevention is more effective than\ntreatment as the CDZ experiences the negative consequences of climate change and variability and,\nthus, investment in agricultural research and rural development projects, such as integrated water\nmanagement projects, sustainable agriculture, and organic farming, is strongly encouraged, so that the\nadaptive capacity of farmers can be increased and climate change vulnerability be reduced. In addition,\npolicy makers and development planners should articulate or implement climate change adaptation\nmeasures and mitigation options to reduce the negative impacts of climate change on agriculture in\nthe Dry Zone of Myanmar.\nAuthor Contributions: A.T.O. and S.S. conceived and designed the study; A.T.O. run the Ricardian model and\ncollected and analyzed all of the data.

Increasing temperatures and altered precipitation\npatterns are likely to affect species distributions as well\nas hydrological cycles, fire regimes, and vegetation\ncommunities. In many cases, successful fish and wildlife\nmanagement will require proactive measures to address\nclimate change. To develop these measures, managers\nwill need a basic understanding of the ways in which\necological systems are likely to respond to climate\nchange (Littell et al. 2011). Models that project the\npotential ecological effects of climate change will play a\ncritical role in providing such an understanding. Specif-\nically, these models can contribute to climate change\nvulnerability assessments, aid in the development of\nclimate change adaptation strategies, and help in setting\nmanagement priorities and goals as part of a larger\nand iterative planning and decision-making process\n(Figure 1).\nHere, we provide an overview of some of the types of\nmodels that can be used to project the effects of climate\nchange on ecological systems (summarized in Table 1),\nand we describe a framework for the effective use of\nmodels (Box 1). We begin with a brief discussion of\nclimate models. We then focus on four areas of climate\nimpacts that are critical to fish and wildlife habitat and\npopulation management: hydrology, fire, vegetation,\nand individual species responses. We describe the types\nof models that are available, discuss model limitations,\nand provide examples of model applications. We develop\nsome of those examples into case studies in which we\ndescribe the methods and model interpretation in\ngreater detail and apply a simple climate-impacts\nmodeling framework. We conclude by making recom-\nmendations for incorporating climate-impacts modeling\ninto fish and wildlife management, being careful to\nconsider the limitations of existing tools. This review is a\ngeneral introduction to modeling tools for projecting\nclimate impacts. It does not provide a comprehensive\nreview of the history or the state-of-the-art in any of the\nfour fields of modeling. Instead, it is meant to be an\naccessible overview of how ecological models can\npotentially contribute to climate-impacts assessments.\nModeling Approaches\nClimate models\nGeneral circulation models (GCMs) are numerical\nmodels that simulate the physical processes of climate.\nThese models are the complex dynamic models upon\nwhich the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\n(IPCC) has based many of its conclusions and whose\noutputs biologists and modelers in other fields have\nused to forecast potential ecological climate impacts.\nThe GCMs used in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report\n(IPCC AR4) were coupled atmosphere\u2013ocean general\ncirculation models that incorporate processes of thermal\nenergy storage and release in the oceans as well as the\natmosphere (Solomon et al. 2007). Most of these models\nincluded sea\u2013ice dynamics and an interactive land\u2013\nsurface component with hydrologic effects, and some\nincluded effects of simulated vegetation. The complexity\nof these models derives from the physical equations\nused to calculate the movement of mass, momentum,\nand energy through the climate system and the multiple\nlayers of the atmosphere and ocean for which energy\ninputs and outputs are calculated. A very simple climate\nmodel might include three layers\u2014the sun and outer\nspace, the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, and the Earth\u2019s surface\u2014\nand model three atmospheric processes: solar radiation,\nthermal radiation, and absorption. The greenhouse effect\nis an emergent property of this system in which thermal\nradiation from the Earth\u2019s surface is absorbed by the\natmosphere and re-radiated back toward the Earth,\nmaintaining the surface temperature within a range\nsuitable for life. General circulation models explicitly\nmodel energy transfer processes such as the greenhouse\neffect and include many more mechanisms of climate\nFigure 1. Integration of climate-impacts modeling into an iterative decision-making process whose goal is to implement and\nevaluate climate-resilient management strategies.\nTools for Assessing Climate Impacts C.B. Wilsey et al.\nJournal of Fish and Wildlife Management | www.fwspubs.org June 2013 | Volume 4 | Issue 1 | 221\nforcing and feedback. A forcing is any model input that\ndirectly impacts either the amount of solar radiation\nreaching the Earth\u2019s surface or the amount of thermal\nradiation exiting to space (Hartmann 1994). Forcings may\nbe natural, such as aerosols of volcanic origin, or\nanthropogenic, such as increases in greenhouse gases\ndue to the burning of fossil fuels. Climate feedbacks\nrespond to changes in global mean temperature and\nalso directly or indirectly affect the Earth\u2019s solar and\nthermal radiation budgets (Bony et al. 2006). Examples\nof feedbacks include humidity (warmer air holds more\nwater vapor, a greenhouse gas that contributes to\nfurther warming), clouds (may result in warming or\ncooling depending on the cloud type), and ice\u2013 and\nland\u2013surface albedo (melting ice results in additional\nwarming because ice cools the Earth\u2019s surface by\nreflecting incoming solar radiation).\nLimitations and uses. Variability in climate projections\nprovides a significant challenge for modeling ecological\nclimate impacts. Climate sensitivity is a standardized\nmeasurement used to quantify this variability. It is the\nchange in global mean temperature that occurs when\nthe global average surface air temperature reaches\nequilibrium in response to a doubling of atmospheric\nCO2 (Bony et al. 2006). Projections of climate sensitivity\nrange from 2.0 to 4.5u C (Solomon et al. 2007), but they\nmay be significantly higher than this projection (Roe and\nBaker 2007). Some of this variability stems from variation\nin GCM structures and inputs. Each of the 23 GCMs\ninvolved in the IPCC AR4 simulates climate processes\ndifferently, producing different projections of future\nclimates (Solomon et al. 2007). Gaps in our\nunderstanding of the climate system also generate\nuncertainty. For example, GCMs are currently unable to\naccurately simulate precipitation (especially in the\ntropics), oceanic oscillations, and cloud dynamics\n(Solomon et al. 2007). Forcing components are also a\nsource of uncertainty in GCM projections, particularly\nthe effect of aerosols and greenhouse-gas emissions\n(Solomon et al. 2007). Finally, the different greenhouse-\ngas emissions scenarios used to define anthropogenic\nforcings in GCMs result in a range of projections. For\ncontinental- or global-scale projections or for more than\nabout two decades into the future, greenhouse-gas\nemission scenarios and GCM structure are the two\ngreatest sources of variability in climate projections\n(Hawkins and Sutton 2009, 2011). The differences in\nemissions scenarios account for the greatest amount of\nvariation in projections farther than about 50 y into the\nfuture. In subcontinental and regional projections of the\nnext one or two decades, internal variability in model\nruns (i.e., climatic variability) is the primary source of\nuncertainty, followed by variability due to GCM structure\n(Hawkins and Sutton 2009). Improved understanding and\nvalidation of climate feedback mechanisms may further\nreduce uncertainties in projected climate sensitivities\n(Bony et al. 2006) and improve confidence in short-term\nregional projections, but they are unlikely to alter long-\nterm global projections (Hawkins and Sutton 2009) or\nreduce the occurrence of extreme projections (Roe and\nBaker 2007).\nGeneral circulation model resolution is often too\ncoarse (15,000\u201325,000 km2) for outputs to be used\ndirectly by regional or local climate-impacts models\n(Solomon et al. 2007). Therefore, projections must be\ndownscaled to finer resolutions, either statistically or\ndynamically. Statistical downscaling translates climate\nprojections to a finer scale (1\u201350 km2) grid cells or a\nTools for Assessing Climate Impacts C.B. Wilsey et al.\nJournal of Fish and Wildlife Management | www.fwspubs.org June 2013 | Volume 4 | Issue 1 | 222\nsingle site by using statistical relationships based on\nhistorical climate records, topography, or both (Salathe\net al. 2007). General circulation model outputs also can\nbe downscaled dynamically with regional climate models\n(RCMs). These models are similar to GCMs, but they\nmodel dominant regional climate mechanisms at finer\nscales (,20 km2). Generally, RCMs differ from statistical\ndownscaling because they model drivers of local climate\nexplicitly (Salathe et al. 2007; Solomon et al. 2007).\nHowever, RCMs can be as difficult to build and time-\nconsuming to run as GCMs. Both statistical and dynamic\n(e.g., RCM) downscaling methods introduce additional\nuncertainty in climate projections. Statistically and\ndynamically downscaled climate projections have been\nmade publicly available at resolutions ranging from 1\nto 50 km2 (e.g., Maurer et al. 2007; Ramirez and Jarvis\n2008; Girvetz et al. 2009; Mearns et al. 2009) at regional\nand global scales, so that ecological and other climate-\nimpacts modelers can avoid the task of manipulating the\nraw GCM output or performing the downscaling.\nComparative studies of output across multiple GCMs\ncoordinated by the Coupled Model Intercomparison\nProject (Meehl et al. 2007; CMIP 2010) found that\nprojected changes in decadal mean surface tempera-\ntures are most informative at approximately 40 y into the\nfuture and noisier with increasing latitude (Hawkins and\nSutton 2009). This finding has led, in part, to a new\nemphasis on decadal prediction that may increase the\navailability of medium-term (10\u201330 y) regional climate\nprojections (Meehl et al. 2009) and is integrated into the\nlatest Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (Taylor\net al. 2012). When studying longer term projections, out\n100 y or more, an explicit characterization of uncertain-\nties becomes more important, typically by using an\nensemble of GCM simulations (e.g., Mote et al. 2011).\nEnsembles combine projections from multiple GCMs,\nemissions pathways, or a combination (Tebaldi and\nKnutti 2007; Knutti et al. 2010) and can help quantify\nthe variability and inherent uncertainty in future climate\nprojections (e.g., Garcia et al. 2012).\nIn spite of the many known uncertainties described\nabove, the climate projections produced by GCMs and\nRCMs are useful for assessing ecological climate impacts.\nThe strength of the GCMs lies in their foundation in\nphysical principles (as opposed to applying purely\nstatistical projections), and their robustness is evident\nin their ability to recreate broad patterns of climate\nvariability and simulate past climates (Solomon et al.\n2007). The latest generation of coupled atmosphere\u2013\nocean general circulation models and Earth System\nModels that include carbon cycling (e.g., http://www.\ncesm.ucar.edu) are a promising improvement. They\ninclude advances in simulations of important phenom-\nena such as the El Nin\u02dco Southern Oscillation (Guilyardi\net al. 2012), and they outperform the previous generation\nof GCMs in their ability to simulate historical temperature\nchanges at fine spatial and temporal scales (Sakaguchi et\nal. 2012). Despite these models representing more\nprocesses in greater detail and including more explicit\nfeedback mechanisms, the variation among model\nprojections has not increased (Knutti and Sedlacek 2012).\nThere have been many attempts to guide the selection\nof which GCMs should be included in a particular\nimpacts study (e.g.,Tebaldi and Knutti 2007). However,\nusing the ability of GCMs to reproduce historical climate\n(i.e., model skill) to rank models is difficult to implement\nconsistently (Knutti et al. 2010; Weigel et al. 2010). The\nmagnitude of projected impacts has generally shown\nlittle dependence on the skill of the GCMs included in\nan ensemble (e.g., Brekke et al. 2008; Pierce et al. 2009).\nSo, it is unclear whether the ability to simulate past\nconditions results in greater certainty in future forecasts,\nleading to the common conclusion that model skill may\nbe less important in estimating climate change impacts\nas long as a large ensemble of GCMs is used (Mote et al.\n2011).\nHydrological models\nAmong other things, hydrological models can simulate\nclimate-driven changes in the timing and quantity of\nstream flow, snowpack dynamics, and evapotranspira-\ntion, all factors with potential to influence fish and\nwildlife populations both directly and through indirect\neffects on habitat suitability. Model outputs can be\nuseful for developing land-management policy. For\nexample, projected downstream impacts of climate\nchange on freshwater species may support upstream\nhabitat restoration or land-use planning, particularly\nwhen model outputs suggest future increases in extreme\nhydrological events, such as drought and flooding.\nOutputs from hydrological models also provide inputs\nto other climate-impacts models, including fire and\nvegetation models.\nThere are a wide variety of hydrological models, and\nthey differ in their structure and application (Kampf and\nBurges 2007). Most hydrological models include equa-\ntions that account for the major components of water\nand energy budgets as well as a flow-routing scheme to\nredistribute water through a catchment. Spatially explicit\nhydrological models divide the study area into discrete\nelements, such as a regular grid. Meteorological data are\npassed to each grid cell, and the model produces\nestimates of important hydrological variables such as\nrunoff, evaporation, and snowpack. Runoff is typically\nrouted through a river network to produce flow\nestimates at strategic points.\nCoarse-scale (15,000\u201325,000 km2), one-dimensional\nhydrological models are embedded in many GCMs.\nThese models can be used to examine global patterns\nof runoff and soil moisture, but they have trouble\nsimulating historical flows because they are one-dimen-\nsional and therefore lack routing in two-dimensional\nspace (Parry et al. 2007). The coarse resolution of GCMs\nand runoff-estimate biases make these models difficult to\nuse at subcontinental scales.\nMacroscale hydrological models (e.g., Liang et al. 1994)\nare typically applied at grid resolutions that range from 4\nto 25 km. They generally represent hydrological process-\nes in more detail than GCM-embedded models (Cher-\nkauer and Lettenmaier 2003). Macroscale models also\ncan be driven by weather station data, regional climate\nmodel output, or statistically downscaled GCM output.\nTools for Assessing Climate Impacts C.B.

Subregional models also are driven by meteoro-\nlogical data, although the data must often be interpo-\nlated. Subregional models are appropriate for simulating\nthe effects of climate and land use on the hydrology of\nsmall catchments, for which representing topographic\ncomplexity is important.\nLimitations and uses. Hydrological models are limited\nby uncertainties in the parameterization of underlying\nphysical equations, model structure, and model inputs,\nsuch as climate data and land\u2013surface parameterizations\n(Parry et al. 2007). These models are particularly sensitive to\nuncertainties in precipitation data, the primary driver of\nhydrology. Precipitation is difficult to measure and is sparsely\nmeasured (e.g., one National Oceanic and Atmospheric\nAdministration cooperative observer station per ,700 km2;\nMaurer et al. 2002), leading to uncertainties in the charac-\nterization of spatial distribution of precipitation used to force\na hydrological model. Projections of future precipitation\ncarry the additional uncertainties related to emission\nscenarios (Christensen et al. 2007), GCMs (Graham et al.\n2007), and downscaling (Fowler et al. 2007). Because future\ntemperature projections are generally more consistent\namong GCMs than precipitation projections, modeled\nhydrologic impacts driven by temperature, such as\nchanges to snow-dominated basins (e.g., McKelvey et al.\n2011), are less variable than impacts that are driven by\nprecipitation.\nNonclimatic factors influence hydrology and may\ncomplicate interpretation of simulations if not included\nin a model. Land-use change, including climate-induced\nvegetation change, may alter hydrology as much as\nclimate change (Parry et al. 2007). For example, the tree\nline may shift upward in elevation with warming (Harsch\net al. 2009), and wildfires may increase in size and\nfrequency in response to warmer, drier conditions (Littell\net al. 2009; Littell and Gwozdz 2011). A warmer, drier\nclimate also could increase irrigation demand such that\neven when coupled with more efficient irrigation\ntechnologies, in-stream flows could be reduced. Changes\nin agriculture, irrigation practices, and reservoir opera-\ntion are as likely as climate-induced change, and\nprevious study shows that such changes can affect\nmodel results (Haddeland et al. 2007). These additional\nfactors are often addressed in a separate model that uses\nhydrological model output to assess water-system\nchanges (e.g., Vicuna et al. 2007). Dynamic vegetation\nresponses, such as effects of increased CO2 concentra-\ntions on biomass production and transpiration rates, can\nbe important at the continental scale (Betts et al. 2007).\nHowever, these vegetation responses are rarely included\nin hydrological models because their hydrologic impact\nis considered substantially smaller than climate or land\nuse (Piao et al. 2007; but see Lawrence et al. 2011).\nHydrological models are useful for developing adap-\ntation strategies to address climate change. Macroscale\nmodels have been used for land-management impact\nassessment (e.g., Haddeland et al. 2007) and mapping of\nsuitable wolverine Gulo gulo habitat based on projected\nspring snowpack (McKelvey et al. 2011). Subregional\nmodels have been used to test the effect of land-use\nchange and forestry practices on flows (e.g., VanShaar\net al. 2002) and to compare the impact of climate and\nhabitat restoration on salmon populations (e.g., Battin et\nal. 2007). Selecting the right model to address the spatial\nscale of interest is crucial, but it often involves balancing\naccuracy with cost while ensuring the model is capable\nof simulating the most important aspects driving local\necosystem impacts. Models are constantly evolving to\nsimulate more aspects of the environment driving or\nresponding to hydrologic change, such as urban and\nagricultural water management (e.g., Yates et al. 2005),\nsediment production and transport (e.g., Doten et al.\n2006), and stream temperatures (e.g., Ficklin et al. 2012).\nSubregional hydrological models may be necessary for\ncapturing local-scale dynamics and climate-induced\nimpacts not captured by coarse-resolution models.\nHowever, a subregional model requires additional time\nto parameterize, calibrate, and run compared with the\nsimpler process of setting up and running a macroscale\nmodel, and many macroscale models do have the ability\nto account statistically for subgrid scale variability in\nelevation, rainfall, or other characteristics. Greater avail-\nability of downscaled climate data may increase the use\nof subregional hydrological models. Climate change\nadaptation strategies for freshwater systems will benefit\nfrom hydrological modeling projections that characterize\nthe direction, magnitude, and uncertainty of future\nchange as well as evaluate the benefits of proposed\nmanagement.\nCase study. Changing river flow rates can have\nsignificant ecological consequences. Flow rates\ninfluence the extent of available freshwater habitat,\nmediate changes in habitat condition over time, regulate\nthe input and output of nutrients and waste, and can\nrestrict habitat connectivity (Rolls et al. 2012). Assess-\ning the consequences of altered flows on species of\nmanagement concern is therefore a high priority for the\nconservation of freshwater species and ecosystems.\nFurthermore, identifying areas in which habitat\npreservation or restoration may mitigate these changes\nis needed for climate change adaptation.\nBattin et al. (2007) linked climate, hydrological, land-\nuse, and wildlife population models to assess the effects\nof climate change on habitat restoration for Chinook\nsalmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha (Box 2). The system of\nlinked models allowed the researchers to simultaneously\nconsider scenarios for both climate change and habitat\nrestoration and to assess their relative impact on salmon\nabundance. Battin et al. (2007) found that climate change\nis likely to impact both peak winter and minimum\nsummer flows, with potential negative impacts on\nsalmon recruitment that outweigh gains from habitat\nrestoration in most places. They addressed uncertainty\nby using outputs from two GCMs and two habitat\nTools for Assessing Climate Impacts C.B. Wilsey et al.\nJournal of Fish and Wildlife Management | www.fwspubs.org June 2013 | Volume 4 | Issue 1 | 226\nrestoration scenarios, but they used only a single CO2\nemissions scenario because variability among emissions\nscenarios is modest in 25- and 50-y projections.\nHydrological outputs from the two GCMs agreed on\nthe simulated magnitude and spatial pattern of change\nin summer minimum flows, but they differed for winter\npeak flows. Given these uncertainties, Battin et al. (2007)\nsuggested focusing on downstream portions of the\nwatershed with greater model agreement and less\nprojected change. These downstream areas had fewer\nsimulated declines in salmon populations under all\nscenarios. A focus on the restoration of low-elevation\nsites for their potential resilience to climate change is a\nstrategy that may apply to other basins supporting\nsalmon populations or other fish populations sensitive to\nflow rates.\nFire models\nFire is an essential ecological process affecting nutrient\ncycling, regulating the density of young trees and the\nredistribution of water and sediment, and creating\nhabitat for fish and wildlife (Noss et al. 2006). Widespread\nchanges in these processes may alter the habitat and\nfood sources for entire wildlife communities, in some\ncases reducing habitat availability and connectivity.\nFire\u2013climate models estimate the effects of climatic\nvariability and change on components of fire regimes,\nincluding frequency, extent, severity, seasonality, and\nspatial pattern. These models can be empirical (e.g.,\nbased on correlative relationships derived from current\nor historical patterns; Flannigan et al. 2005), process-\nbased (e.g., based on rules or functions that together\nsimulate one or more processes; Andrews et al. 2004), or\nTools for Assessing Climate Impacts C.B. Wilsey et al.\nJournal of Fish and Wildlife Management | www.fwspubs.org June 2013 | Volume 4 | Issue 1 | 227\nsome combination of the two (Keane et al. 2004), and\nthey have been used at many spatial and temporal scales\n(Flannigan et al. 2009). Given the critical role that fire\nplays in shaping the composition and distribution of\nvegetation, understanding the effects of climate change\non fire regimes will be critical for wildlife management.\nFire is a contagious disturbance process that spreads\nacross a landscape based on local weather and the\nspatial connectivity of fuels (Peterson 2002; McKenzie\net al. 2011). Climate drives fire regimes through the\nshort-term effects of weather on fuel moisture and the\nlong-term effects of climate on vegetation growth and\ndistribution. Vegetation patterns combine with climate\nand topography to influence fire regimes (Swetnam and\nBetancourt 1998) whose pattern, severity, and seasonal-\nity then strongly influence vegetation composition and\nstructure (Lenihan et al. 2008). Viewed at coarse scales\n(e.g., subcontinental regions), fire is driven by climate\n(Littell et al. 2009). At finer scales (e.g., a watershed or\nforest stand), fuel loads and topography can have\nsubstantial effects, except under extreme weather\nconditions (Turner and Romme 1994). Consequently,\ncoarse-scale fire models tend to be empirical models of\nfire weather, occurrence, or area burned based on the\nclimatic conditions that drive extreme weather events\n(Lenihan et al. 2008). Fine-scale process-based models,\nincluding models of fire behavior and landscape\nsuccession models, often take a wider array of inputs,\nincluding vegetation structure and available fuels,\ntopography, and ignition sources, in combination with\nclimate-driven weather.\nThe temporal scale of a study also influences which\nprocesses are included in process-based simulation\nmodels and which variables are used for empirical\nmodels. For example, short-term dynamic predictions\nof fire behavior and fire effects usually simulate fire\nspread combined with calculations of consumption,\nsmoke emissions, and plant mortality (Keane et al.\n2003). Long-term projections can be based on empirical\nmodels derived from paleo-fire records (Higuera et al.\n2009) and climate reconstructions, 20th century meteo-\nrological and fire observations (Littell et al. 2009), or\nmultidecadal simulations that couple GCM outputs with\na dynamic vegetation model that includes a fire module\n(Lenihan et al. 2008).\nAmong the most integrative modeling approaches are\nthe so-called landscape fire succession models that\ncombine process-based simulation methods with empir-\nical relationships between climate and fire, to project\nthe impacts of climate on vegetation, fire, and their\ninteraction (Keane et al. 2004). These models typically\nproduce spatially explicit estimates of vegetation suc-\ncession, fire ignitions, fire spread (area burned), and fire\neffects (e.g., mortality, consumption, smoke, and soil\nheating), but they come in many forms and vary widely\nin complexity (Keane et al. 2004). There are four general\ncomponents of the ideal landscape fire succession\nmodel: 1) ecological processes; 2) climate dynamics; 3)\ndisturbance interactions; and 4) spatially explicit struc-\nture and process, but no models currently in use have all\nof these components (R. E. Keane, USDA Forest Service,\nRocky Mountain Research Station, Missoula Fire Sciences\nLaboratory, personal communication). More sophisticat-\ned landscape fire succession models\u2014particularly those\nthat are to be applied to mountainous and semiarid\nlandscapes\u2014could incorporate topographically relevant\nhydrological models.\nLimitations and uses. One of the largest limitations of\nusing empirical models to predict future fire regimes is the\nassumption that historical relationships among climate,\nfuels, and fire will hold in the future. Novel climates, new\nvegetation communities, and future management policies\nmay alter many of these historical relationships, particularly\nat finer spatial scales (McKenzie and Littell 2011). Process-\nbased simulation models are similarly limited by their\nreliance on historical relationships for the specification of\nkey fire-regime parameters, such as distributions of\nignition probabilities and metrics of fire severity for\nspecific vegetation types. Furthermore, process-based\nmodels vary in the extent to which human impacts, such\nas ignition probabilities, or the impacts of other natural\ndisturbances, such as insect outbreaks and plant disease\n(Seidl et al. 2011), are considered.\nAlthough it may be difficult to predict future fire\nregimes accurately for a given location, the differences\nbetween simulations run under a range of conditions will\ninform management decisions (Keane et al. 2004). For\nexample, when given a range of possible outcomes,\nmanagers can weigh the relative need for prescribed\nburning, firefighting, and buffering of wildlife habitats.\nEmpirical models have illustrated relationships between\n20th century climate and area burned (Littell et al. 2009)\nand fire frequency (Gedalof et al. 2005), suggesting\nincreased fire risk given projected future climate.\nProcess-based fire simulation models suggest that\nnegative feedback from forest clearing and previous\nfires may reduce, but not eliminate, projected climate-\ninduced increases in area burned (Krawchuck and\nCumming 2010). These models, along with near- and\nlong-term climate projections, may help to identify\nwhere adaptive management techniques might be\ncost-effective and how much fire-control costs may\nescalate (Corringham et al. 2008). Reliable climate\nforecasts a season or two in advance could inform\nnational fire management plans in time for proactive\nmanagement. Long-term projections of climate can be\nused to assess potential impacts of climate-altered fire\nregimes on vegetation.\nCase study. Wildfire impacts nutrient cycles, young\ntrees and understory vegetation, and the distribution of\nwater and sediment, all of which can impact fish and\nwildlife habitats (Noss et al. 2006). Changes in wildfire\nmay benefit some wildlife species at the expense of\nothers (e.g., Smucker et al. 2005), making it critical to\ncharacterize the direction and magnitude of projected\nchange. Annual area burned, fire season length, and the\nfrequency of large fires have been used to characterize\nregional changes in wildfire (Westerling et al. 2006) and\ncan be estimated from GCM outputs (e.g., Westerling and\nBryant 2007). Identifying regions with increasing risk of\nfire under climate change would alert managers to the\nneed for planning and treatment to protect critical\nTools for Assessing Climate Impacts C.B. Wilsey et al.\nJournal of Fish and Wildlife Management | www.fwspubs.org June 2013 | Volume 4 | Issue 1 | 228\nwildlife areas as well as to potentially looming\nsuppression costs.\nFlannigan et al. (2005) used statistical models to\npredict annual forest area burned across Canada under\nsimulated future climates (Box 3). Models were con-\nstructed for eight ecozones reflecting broad-scale\nhistorical differences in fire frequency and extent. Models\nused historical meteorological data as predictors of area\nburned calculated from a large fire database spanning\n1959\u20131997 (Stocks et al. 2002). Projections were made\nusing outputs from two GCM models run for a single\nemissions scenario that simulated a tripling of atmo-\nspheric CO2 concentrations by the end of the century.\nOutputs suggest that annual area burned by wildfires will\nlikely increase across Canada. There is some uncertainty\namong the GCM models used regarding the magnitude\nof the increase, but no ecozones were projected to\nexperience declining wildfire. The potential addition of\nmillions of hectares burned annually could result in\ndramatic changes in the distribution of vegetation and\nassociated wildlife across Canada. These results are most\ninformative for improving regional forest management\npolicy, but they are too coarse in resolution for assessing\nthe impacts at a specific location. Furthermore, outputs\nfrom a larger number of GCMs would better characterize\nthe uncertainty surrounding the magnitude of projected\nincreases. In spite of their limitations, these results\nsuggest that evaluating fire impacts on fish and wildlife\nhabitats across the boreal forest and taiga regions of\nCanada would be useful to identify wildlife species that\nmay require protection or assistance under increasing\nwildfire.\nVegetation models\nVegetation is fundamental for terrestrial food webs\nand is an essential element in the habitat of many animal\nspecies. As climates change, plant species ranges will\nshift; biomes will exhibit altered characteristics; and the\nstructure and composition of vegetation communities\nwill adjust, all influencing habitat and food resources for\nmany animals. Therefore, vegetation models have the\npotential to provide insight for local- to continental-scale\nmanagement, policy and for planning decisions regard-\ning wildlife.\nTools for Assessing Climate Impacts C.B. Wilsey et al.\nJournal of Fish and Wildlife Management | www.fwspubs.org June 2013 | Volume 4 | Issue 1 | 229\nVegetation models range from statistical models that\nidentify relationships between plant distributions and\nenvironmental variables to mechanistic models that\nsimulate the physical processes controlling the distribu-\ntion of vegetation. Statistical models are often used to\nproject changes in the distributions of individual plant\nspecies or communities (e.g., Rehfeldt et al. 2012). These\nmodels are described in the Individual Species Models\nsection below. Here, we focus on process-based vege-\ntation models.\nProcess-based vegetation models simulate aspects of\nplant physiology (e.g., photosynthesis), carbon and\nnutrient cycles, competition between individual plants\nor vegetation types, disturbance regimes, hydrology, and\nother processes. They include forest gap models (e.g.,\nBugmann 2001; Larocque et al. 2011), landscape models\n(e.g., Keane et al. 2004; Keane et al. 2011), terrestrial\nbiogeochemistry models of carbon and nutrient cycles\n(e.g., Parton et al. 2007), dynamic global vegetation\nmodels (Cramer et al. 2001; Quillet et al. 2010), and\ncoupled hydrology\u2013vegetation models (e.g., Tague and\nBand 2004; Lawrence et al. 2011). Vegetation in these\nmodels is represented as individual species, plant\nfunctional types (e.g., deciduous broadleaf trees and\ngrass), or by using general measures of vegetation (e.g.,\nnet primary productivity). The models may simulate\nprocesses on subdaily to annual time-steps and over\nspatial extents ranging from individual plot to global.\nInput data for these models typically include climate data\n(e.g., temperature and precipitation), atmospheric CO2\nconcentrations, and soil characteristics (e.g., soil texture).\nThe models may specify bioclimatic limits (e.g., lethal\ntemperatures) and other biophysical parameters (e.g.,\nrooting depth and fire resistance) for particular species\nor vegetation types. Dynamic vegetation models can\nsimulate changes in vegetation over time in response to\nchanging climate, whereas equilibrium vegetation mod-\nels simulate vegetation under a static climate (e.g.,\naverage conditions).\nLimitations and uses. The ecological processes\nsimulated in vegetation models are complex. In many\ncases, the calculations of particular processes may\nrequire empirical parameters that are not well known.\nFor example, changes in atmospheric CO2 concentra-\ntions can affect plant water-use efficiency, but more\ninformation about how this effect varies among different\nplant species and life stages is needed to better represent\nthis response in vegetation models. Furthermore,\nindividual vegetation models may explicitly simulate\nsome processes, such as fire, but either ignore or\nsimplify other processes, such as grazing and insect\noutbreaks, that may be as important in determining the\ndistribution of vegetation in certain areas (Seidl et al.\n2011). As one might expect, the assumptions made in the\nbuilding and parameterization of vegetation models can\nsubstantially affect model projections (Cramer et al. 2001;\nQuillet et al. 2010).\nVegetation models vary in their complexity and ease\nof use. Applying these models to particular manage-\nment and research questions can require a detailed\nunderstanding of ecosystem processes and computer\nprogramming expertise to correctly parameterize a\nmodel. Vegetation models also differ in their ability to\naccount for the effects of land-use practices and land-\ncover changes that may alter the flow of water or\nnutrients, fire regimes, or the vegetation itself. To more\naccurately project future climate-driven vegetation\nchanges, future vegetation models will need to incor-\nporate land-use projections and simulate their effects\non vegetation.\nDespite their limitations, all of the types of process-\nbased vegetation models discussed above have been\napplied to conservation and natural resource manage-\nment questions, including silvicultural applications\n(Pabst et al. 2008), forecasting areas of potential fire risk\n(Lenihan et al. 2008), and simulating future changes in\nhabitat (Morin and Thuiller 2009). The choice of which\nmodel or combination of models to apply to a particular\nmanagement question will depend on the specific\naspects of vegetation one wishes to simulate; its spatial\nand temporal resolution; and the importance of partic-\nular processes, such as fire. For example, forest gap\nmodels simulate stand-level processes, but many are\nlimited in their ability to predict vegetation responses\nacross broader spatial scales (Bugmann 2001). In\ncontrast, a dynamic global vegetation model may\nsimulate basic plant functional types that can be\ntranslated into vegetation types or biomes (e.g., broad-\nleaf evergreen forest, grassland, and conifer woodland)\nover regional to global scales, but it may not be able to\nsimulate gradients in species composition or forest stand\nstructure.\nSome limitations can be overcome by integrating\nmodels of varying complexity and scale. For example,\naspects of forest gap models have been incorporated\ninto both landscape models (e.g., He et al. 2005; Keane\net al. 2011) and dynamic vegetation models (e.g., Smith\net al. 2001) to improve their simulations of plot-level\nvegetation dynamics. Another approach uses a mathe-\nmatical approximation to scale-up the outcome of\nstochastic gap model processes to resolutions suitable\nfor subcontinental scales (Moorcroft et al. 2001), resulting\nin output that is both locally accurate and transferable\nacross regions (Medvigy et al. 2009). Although vegeta-\ntion models generally cannot predict future vegetation\nchanges with high accuracy and spatial resolution, the\nmodels can help managers to characterize the future\nrates and magnitudes of potential vegetation changes\nand to identify species and regions that may be\nparticularly sensitive (or particularly resilient) to future\nclimate changes (e.g., Lenihan et al. 2008). These results\nin turn can be used to help inform the management of\nanimal species and their habitat in the face of climate\nchange. They can provide guidance on where to restore\nand where not to restore habitats, which populations to\nmonitor, and where populations will need to be\nintensively managed.\nCase study. Prairies and savannahs are some of the\nmost threatened ecosystems in the United States\n(Hoekstra et al. 2005). Consequently, the prairies and\nsavannas of the Pacific Northwest are home to a large\nnumber of state-listed and federal candidate species,\nTools for Assessing Climate Impacts C.B. Wilsey et al.\nJournal of Fish and Wildlife Management | www.fwspubs.org June 2013 | Volume 4 | Issue 1 | 230\nincluding the streaked horned lark Eremophila alpestris\nstrigata, Taylor\u2019s checkerspot butterfly Euphydras editha\ntaylori, Mazama pocket gopher Thomomys mazama,\nand western gray squirrel Sciurus griseus. Managing\npopulations of these species requires an understanding\nof how climate change will alter their habitats. Projected\nchanges in vegetation across the Pacific Northwest will\nhave the potential to inform decisions about which\npopulations to monitor, where to put limited restoration\ndollars, and how to plan for connectivity. Bachelet et al.\n(2011) summarized output from a dynamic global\nvegetation model (Rogers et al. 2011) projecting\npotential climate-driven changes in vegetation in the\nWillamette Valley-Puget Trough-Georgia Basin ecoregion\n(Box 4). From all of the GCMs in the IPCC AR4, they\nselected three GCMs whose projections captured the\nrange of outputs for the region and included three CO2\nemissions scenarios. Of the nine model runs considered,\nnone projected an increase in prairie and savanna\nhabitats for the end of the century, likely because the\ndynamic global vegetation model simulated higher\nwater use efficiency in trees accompanying greater\natmospheric CO2 concentrations, thereby increasing\ntheir tolerance of drought. Instead, the cool and wet\nclimate projection produced no change in simulated\nvegetation distributions, the hot and dry projection\nsimulated the western expansion of dry forest from the\neastern Cascades, and the hot and wet projection\nsimulated the northward expansion of warmer forests.\nThus, prairie and savanna ecosystems appear likely to\nremain rare with climate change. Yet, empirical evidence\nassembled by Bachelet et al. (2011) suggests that prairies\nand savannas may be more resilient than forests to warm\nand dry summers, particularly if climate change brings\nmore extreme drought and fire. Bachelet et al. (2011)\ntherefore advise managers to restore prairies in\nunproductive agricultural lands and forest lands that\nare likely to become warmer and drier with climate\nchange. Managers also may want to consider assisted\nmigration within the ecoregion to increase populations\nof rare species. Finally, managers may want to monitor\nand improve existing sites that are likely to continue\nfunctioning as prairies over the coming century.\nIndividual species models\nThe ultimate goal of fish and wildlife management is\nstable, resilient animal populations that can only be\nassessed with species-specific models. Individual species\nmodels can be designed to estimate habitat suitability,\nspecies distributions, movement, and population-level\n(i.e., demographic) responses. Many modeling approach-\nes that estimate historical changes in populations of\nthreatened and endangered species also can be used to\nsimulate future climate-induced changes.\nEmpirical approaches, typically referred to as climate-\nenvelope, niche, or bioclimatic models, are used to\nproject potential climate-driven shifts in species distri-\nbutions (Pearson and Dawson 2003; Heikkenen et al.\n2006). These models use either statistical or machine-\nlearning methods to identify relationships between\ncurrent species distributions and current climate, and\nthey use future climate to generate projected distribu-\ntions. Most empirical models use only climatic variables\nas predictors (e.g., temperature, precipitation, growing\ndegree days, and drought indices), but some have\nincorporated other variables, such as land cover,\nelevation, or soil type (Prasad et al. 2006).\nWhereas empirical models have generally been used\nto project changes in species\u2019 potential distributions,\nprocess-based models have been used to simulate a\nwider array of species-specific ecological effects. For\nexample, dispersal models can simulate movement in\nresponse to climate change (e.g., Iverson et al. 2004);\npopulation models can simulate annual recruitment as\na function of climate-driven changes in habitat, food\nresources, predators, or competitors (e.g., Carroll 2007);\ndistribution models can make projections based on\nphenology, reproduction, and survival (e.g., Morin and\nThuiller 2009); and bioenergetic models can project the\nresponses of trophic groups (e.g., phyto- and zooplank-\nton) to climate-driven changes in total energy (e.g.,\nPeeters et al. 2007). Generally, climate is incorporated\ninto these models through empirical relationships\nbetween temperature, precipitation, or both and indi-\nvidual fitness, such as making growth and reproduction a\nfunction of water temperature (Clark et al. 2003) or\nvarying survival with annual snowfall (Carroll 2007).\nEmpirical and process-based models also can be linked;\nfor example, using empirical models of habitat suitability\nas input to a process-based population model (e.g.,\nCarroll 2007; McRae et al. 2008; Franklin 2010; Lawson\net al. 2010).\nLimitations and uses. Empirical species distribution\nmodels provide a preliminary estimate of how plant and\nanimal distributions may respond to climate change, but\nthey have several limitations. First, empirical models do\nnot directly model biotic interactions (e.g., predator\u2013\nprey dynamics, keystone species, competition, or host\nspecificity) that may influence potential range shifts\n(Pearson and Dawson 2003; Zarnetske et al. 2012).\nSecond, these models generally do not address\ndispersal capacity or barriers to dispersal that may\ninfluence colonization of projected habitats (Pearson\nand Dawson 2003; Schloss et al. 2012). Third, empirical\nmodels do not consider evolutionary adaptation\n(Pearson and Dawson 2003). Fourth, it is unclear how\nmodels parameterized under present-day climates will\nperform in simulated future climate with no present-day\nanalog (Williams and Jackson 2007; Williams et al., 2013).\nFifth, bioclimatic tolerances may vary across life stages,\nimpacting persistence and colonization (Jackson et al.\n2009; Mclaughlin and Zavaleta 2012). Sixth, different\ntypes of empirical models can produce very different\nprojected shifts in the potential range of a species,\nsometimes introducing more uncertainty than the\nunderlying GCM projections (Garcia et al. 2012),\nnecessitating care in model selection and testing\n(Thuiller 2004) or using ensembles of multiple models\n(Arau\u00b4jo and New 2007).\nGiven these limitations, empirical species distribution\nmodels are not currently accurate enough to be the sole\nsource of information for selecting reserve networks,\nTools for Assessing Climate Impacts C.B. Wilsey et al.\nJournal of Fish and Wildlife Management | www.fwspubs.org June 2013 | Volume 4 | Issue 1 | 231\nidentifying translocation sites, or deciding to abandon\nmanagement of a population. However, they are likely to\nbe useful for identifying populations at risk due to a\nsignificant climate-driven range contraction (Pearson\nand Dawson 2003). These models also can help focus\nconservation efforts and monitoring programs by\nidentifying habitats where we might expect to see the\nlargest changes in flora or fauna (Arau\u00b4jo et al. 2006). For\nspecific management decisions regarding individual\nspecies, these models can be used in conjunction with\nexperimental information, paleoecological records, and\nsimulations from detailed process-based models to\nincrease projection accuracy.\nAlthough process-based models of species distribu-\ntions and populations have the potential to provide\nmore accurate projections than empirical models, they\nalso have limitations. Many of these limitations are similar\nto those discussed above in reference to the vegetation\nmodels. First, many of the parameters and relationships\nthat would ideally be incorporated into these models are\npoorly known, such as dispersal rates and temperature\nand precipitation effects on survival and reproduction.\nSecond, the structure of process-based models may limit\ntheir application. Some are built to investigate the effect\nof one particular aspect of climate (e.g., temperature) on\nreproduction, growth, or survival (Kell et al. 2005) and may\nTools for Assessing Climate Impacts C.B. Wilsey et al.\nJournal of Fish and Wildlife Management | www.fwspubs.org June 2013 | Volume 4 | Issue 1 | 232\nexclude other critical factors (e.g., dispersal, Clark et al.\n2003). Still, when sufficient empirical information is\navailable to parameterize a process-based model, the\nmodel is useful for characterizing population-level re-\nsponses to climate change. Furthermore, process-based\nmodels linked with other empirical (e.g., habitat) or\nprocess-based models (e.g., vegetation, hydrology, and\nfire) can be used to simulate cumulative effects (Lawson et\nal. 2010) or to compare the relative effects of stressors\n(Battin et al. 2007; Carroll 2007; McRae et al. 2008) on\nspecies\u2019 populations.\nCase study. Marten and lynx Lynx canadensis in the\nnorthern Appalachians of the United States and Canada\nforage on top of snowpack during the winter, making\nthem sensitive to rising temperatures and declining\nsnowfall. Both are exploited populations occurring at the\nsouthern limit of their distributions. Marten, in particular,\nhas recovered from near extirpation in the 1930s.\nMarten populations are also sensitive to the loss and\nfragmentation of mature forest stands with structurally\ncomplex understories (Ray 2000). In an approach similar\nto that taken by Battin et al. (2007), Carroll (2007) linked\nmultiple models to estimate the relative impacts of\nclimate change, logging, and hunting on marten pop-\nulations in the northern Appalachians (Box 5). The\nsystem of linked models allowed for scenarios\naddressing stressors individually and in combination.\nSimulations demonstrated that declining snowpack may\nhave a greater impact than logging or trapping alone\nand that logging may interact synergistically with climate\nchange to decrease marten populations. Carroll (2007)\nsummarizes results by state and province and makes\nregion-specific recommendations for habitat restoration,\nlogging, exploitation, and reintroduction potential. These\ntypes of outputs would be very useful for species and\nhabitat management as well as decisions on logging and\nhunting. However, the use of a single GCM and single\nemissions scenario puts into question the generality of\nthese findings. Carroll (2007) does note that there is\nagreement among all IPCC AR4 GCMs regarding the\ndirection and magnitude of projected changes in\ntemperature and precipitation for this geographic\nregion. However, representing that variability explicitly\nwould strengthen his conclusions.\nDiscussion\nUsing models for managing natural resources\nGiven the wide array of available models and their\nnumerous limitations (Table 1), fish and wildlife manag-\ners often wonder which model to use and how to apply\nmodel projections to a given management decision. We\nhave provided a basic framework for climate-impacts\nmodeling (Box 1) and used it to discuss the results of\nseveral climate-impact studies (Boxes 2\u20135). In general,\nselecting one or more models to assess potential climate\nimpacts requires an understanding of the underlying\nquestion and the key ecological processes involved. For\nexample, modeling climate impacts on fire-dependent\nwildlife habitats will require, at the minimum, a\nvegetation model that adequately addresses the effects\nof climate on fire. Selecting an appropriate model also\nrequires matching the spatial and temporal scale of the\nassessment with that of the model. For example,\nalthough a macroscale hydrological model may provide\na useful estimate of runoff for a watershed, it may\nprovide relatively poor estimates of changes in stream\nflow for a specific stream reach. The selection of a\nparticular model also will depend on the time, resources,\nand technical capabilities available to the user. Here, the\ndifference between empirical and statistical models and\nsimulation models is paramount. Empirical models are\nless complex, require fewer inputs, and are generally\nmore accessible; but they include a suite of biological\nassumptions that observational data suggest are violat-\ned. Therefore, they are most appropriate for coarse-scale\nprojections of climate responses. A complex simulation\nmodel may provide the best estimate of a species\u2019\nresponse to climate change, but often data, time,\nmodeling expertise, or a combination are lacking. In\nthose cases, first consider whether a broad-scale\nmodeling analysis including the geographic area of\ninterest has already been completed. Alternatively,\nrethink the management question to no longer require\nthe additional accuracy (or ecological realism) that might\nbe provided by a more complex model, for example,\nchoosing to focus on changes in habitat suitability\ninstead of population demographics.\nIncreasingly, downscaled climate projections are avail-\nable online (e.g., ClimateWizard, http://www.climatewi-\nzard.org and the Oregon Climate Change Research\nInstitute, http://occri.net), and projections from hydro-\nlogical, fire, and vegetation models are being shared\nthrough cooperative associations such as the U.S.\nDepartment of Interior\u2019s Landscape Conservation Coop-\neratives (http://www.doi.gov/lcc/index.cfm), the U.S.\nGeological Survey\u2019s National Climate Change and Wildlife\nScience Center (https://nccwsc.usgs.gov), and nongov-\nernmental data-sharing portals such as Data Basin\n(http://www.databasin.org). As these datasets become\nmore ubiquitous, it is critical for nonspecialists to\nunderstand appropriate uses for model outputs.\nUnderstanding the thornier issue of how model results\ncan inform management is as important as selecting the\nbest set of models for an assessment. No model can\npredict the future with certainty. Furthermore, the\nuncertainties inherent in future climate-change projec-\ntions are increased when linked to ecological climate-\nimpacts models that have their own associated uncer-\ntainty (Maslin and Austin 2012). In the case studies\ndescribed above, both Battin et al. (2007) and Carroll\n(2007) linked multiple models to explore climate impacts\nin conjunction with other stressors. Similar studies have\nbeen completed for songbirds (McCrae et al. 2008),\nwolverine (McKelvey et al. 2011), and plants (Lawson\net al. 2010). The best applications of these models treat\nuncertainty explicitly. Thorough sensitivity analyses\ncalculating the impact of varying all components in a\nsystem of linked models are currently rare (but see Fuller\net al. 2008; Conlisk et al. 2013), but they should be\npursued when possible to better understand the\nbehavior of any complex model.

Wilsey et al.\nJournal of Fish and Wildlife Management | www.fwspubs.org June 2013 | Volume 4 | Issue 1 | 234\nfrom multiple GCMs and emissions scenarios is also\ncritical for quantifying uncertainty. For example, studies\nindicate that using an ensemble of GCM projections,\npreferably more than 10, is more important than the\ncareful selection of one or two projections for charac-\nterizing future hydrologic impacts of climate change\n(Pierce et al. 2009). Such approaches bracket potential\nfuture outcomes of climate change and can be used in\nmaking consensus recommendations for conservation or\nin designing management actions robust to a range of\nclimate impacts (e.g., Bachelet et al. 2011).\nEnsemble modeling combines the outputs of multiple\nmodel projections, allowing the modeler to quantify the\nconfidence in model outputs across an array of different\ninputs or model structures (Arau\u00b4jo and New 2007). For\nexample, ensembles of models can project mean or\nmedian warming with associated confidence bands\n(Solomon et al. 2007). Alternatively, ensembles can be\nused to report the degree of agreement in model\nprojection; for example, 80% of modeled future climates\nproject at least a 50% change in the fauna of a given\nregion (Lawler et al. 2009). Although depicting only\nmean values or the degree of consensus among model\nprojections can be useful, it also can be misleading.\nAgreement within a set of model projections does not\nmean that those models are correct. In some cases, such\nas projecting the severity of future drought or flood\nevents, projections of extremes (minimums or maxi-\nmums) may be more critical than consensus or mean\nprojections (e.g., Deser et al. 2012). However, agreement\namong models with different structures does suggest\nthat those projections are robust to the assumptions of\nmultiple model designs (Morin and Thuiller 2009),\nimplying that the projections reflect a true underlying\npattern or trend.\nScenario-based modeling provides another approach\nto exploring the potential effects of varying model inputs\nor parameterizations. A scenario is a set of model\ninputs reflecting how a system may behave or change.\nExamples of scenarios include differing CO2 emissions\nrates, patterns of urban development, and estimates of\nplant water-use efficiency responses. Scenario-based\nmodeling contributes to the process of scenario-based\nplanning in which decisions are made by exploring the\nimpacts of several different potential future outcomes\n(Peterson et al. 2003). Scenario-based modeling can be\nused to compare the effects of particular climatic\nchanges (e.g., warmer and wetter vs. warmer and drier\nclimates) or to compare the potential effects of extreme\nand mean projected changes. The IPCC, among others,\nhas provided guidance on scenario-based planning in\nthe context of climate change (IPCC-TGICA 2007).\nClimate change vulnerability assessment provides a\nframework for integrating climate-impacts projections\nwith empirical information to characterize the vulnera-\nbility of species or ecological systems to climate change\n(Williams et al. 2008; Glick et al. 2011). Vulnerability\ndepends on a species\u2019 exposure and sensitivity to climate\nchange as well as its adaptive capacity and therefore\nintegrates information from diverse sources, including\nmodeling, natural history, experimental science, and\npaleoecological records (Dawson et al. 2011; and, e.g.,\nhttp://climatechangesensitivity.org). Vulnerability scores\nand rankings can then point toward additional studies or\ninformation gaps that help integrate climate change into\nnatural resource management decisions.\nAnother, complementary, way to use uncertain infor-\nmation in the decision-making and planning process is\nthrough adaptive management (Holling 1978; Peterson\net al. 2011). Adaptive management is an iterative process\nin which multiple management actions are evaluated\nwith long-term monitoring, the outcome of which is\nused to inform future management (Figure 1). The\ninherent uncertainty of the ecological impacts of cli-\nmate change makes it an appropriate application of an\nadaptive management framework (Arvai et al. 2006).\nOutputs of climate-impacts models can be used to\ndesign a suite of short-term management prescriptions\nand then be recalibrated with data or knowledge gained\nfrom their monitoring. In one example, a hydrological\nmodel will be used within an adaptive management\nframework to reduce the frequency of algal blooms\nunder future climates (Viney et al. 2007). Adaptive\nmanagement will likely be a key tool for dealing with\nthe uncertainties inherent in climate-impacts projections\n(West et al. 2009; Littell et al. 2011).\nConclusions\nClimate-impacts modeling is a rapidly expanding field\nof research. Models are becoming more sophisticated\nand better able to capture physical and ecological\nprocesses. Yet, at best, models will be an approximation\nof an uncertain future. Therefore, it will always be critical\nto address model uncertainty through model ensem-\nbles and a range of future scenarios and to reevaluate\ndecisions regularly, ideally in a framework of adaptive\nmanagement. Also of value are ways of integrating\nmodel outputs with experimental results, paleoecologi-\ncal records (e.g., Mart\u0131\u00b4nez-Meyer et al. 2004), and expert\nopinion. Questions to ask of any climate-impacts study\ninclude the following: How well do you capture the\nrange of potential futures? How much agreement is\nthere among those models and scenarios? Can you\ndevelop management strategies that are resilient to all\npotential futures? This last question points toward\nclimate change adaptation for which many institutional\nframeworks exist (Bachelet et al. 2010) and toward which\nclimate-impacts modeling can contribute.\nModels play a critical role in our understanding of\nclimate-change impacts on ecological systems. For these\nmodels to be useful, the uncertainties in model\nprojections need to be understood. However, these\nuncertainties should not prevent researchers and man-\nagers from using models to explore potential future\nclimate impacts, assess vulnerabilities, and develop\nadaptation strategies.\nSupplemental Material\nPlease note: The Journal of Fish and Wildlife Management\nis not responsible for the content or functionality of any\nTools for Assessing Climate Impacts C.B.
