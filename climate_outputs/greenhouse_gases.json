Spreading the reductions over multiple gases may have a considerable impact \non the economic costs of compliance, even though the non-CO2 gases are only responsible for a \nrelatively small share of total emissions. Most importantly, the widely diverging marginal \nabatement costs of the gases offer the potential for realising considerable efficiency gains. This \nDiscussion Paper presents the results of incorporating methane and nitrous oxide in a multi-\nregion and multi-sector applied general equilibrium model (WorldScan). The approach \npresented is consistent with bottom-up information on reduction possibilities for those non-CO2 \ngreenhouse gases, while it allows for general equilibrium effects and inter-gas interactions. \nMost applied general equilibrium models for climate policies only use a rule of thumb for \nemission reductions of non-CO2 gases. \nThe results show that non-CO2 abatement can lower costs substantially for all regions, although \nthe magnitude of this cost reduction varies over regions. For the members of EU-15, the USA \nand other OECD countries, the share of non-CO2 gases in total reduction is modest and declines \nrapidly at higher prices, so that there is a smaller role for non-CO2 gases at higher emission \nprices. However, the sectoral effects of employing a multi-gas strategy are considerable at low \nprices. Part of the burden on gas, coal and oil products has now been shifted to the agricultural \nsectors. Reductions of non-CO2 gases could be especially important for countries like China and \nIndia if they would participate in international climate policy.  \n \n \n   8 \n \n \n   9 \n1  Introduction\n1 \nThe Kyoto Protocol (1997) commits a group of industrialised countries\u2014the Annex-B \ncountries\n2\u2014 to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases in 2008-2012 to approximately 5% \nbelow their 1990 levels. Compared to a reference scenario without climate policy, the reduction \nis much larger than this 5%, however. Emissions have grown in most countries since 1990, and \nwill continue to do so without additional policy measures. This sizeable reduction has raised \nconcern about the associated economic costs. Fortunately, the Protocol contains a number of \nflexibility mechanisms to lower the costs of compliance. One of these is the \u2018what-\nflexibility\u2019\n3\u2014 the possibility of spreading the reduction commitments over multiple gases such \nas carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and a group of fluorinated gases.  \nMost economic analyses deal only with CO2 emission reductions, but interest in non-CO2 \ngreenhouse gases is growing. Even though non-CO2 greenhouse gases are responsible for only \n28% of the Kyoto gas emissions measured in CO2-equivalents,\n4 their inclusion in the \ncalculations may have a considerable impact on the economic costs of compliance: the widely \ndiverging marginal abatement costs of the gases offer the potential for realising considerable \nefficiency gains. Previous studies have estimated the cost savings of a multi-gas strategy \ncompared to a CO2- only policy to be more than proportional to the emission contributions of \nthe non-CO2 greenhouse gases (Hayhoe et al., 1999; Manne and Richels, 2001; Reilly et al., \n1999; Reilly et al., 2003, Hyman et al., 2002). In most of these studies, the non-CO2 greenhouse \ngases are incorporated in the model through exogenous marginal abatement cost (MAC) curves, \nderived from bottom-up analyses.\n5 The MAC-curves show the cost of abating the next \nincremental ton of greenhouse gas for each level of overall abatement. A MAC-curve is derived \nby ordering abatement opportunities by cost from low to high, and plotting the total abatement \nvolume of each option. \nAn important disadvantage of using exogenous MAC-curves is their inability to capture \ninter-gas interactions. For instance, several methane sources are linked to energy use, so that a \ntax on fossil fuels will also bring down methane emissions. Moreover, employing exogenous \nMAC-curves also neglects general equilibrium effects, such as the impact on import and export \n \n1 The authors thank the RIVM (The National Institute of Public Health and the Environment), and especially Bas Eickhout, \nDetlef van Vuuren en Michel den Elzen for fruitful discussions and for access to their data. Moreover, they thank George \nGelauff, Theo van de Klundert, Arjan Lejour, Ton Manders, Paul Tang and Paul Veenendaal for helpful comments and \nsuggestions. \n2 The Annex I or Annex B group consists of Western and Eastern Europe, the USA, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand \nand the former Soviet Union (the USA and Australia have decided not to ratify the Protocol, however). The Annex B group \ncan thus roughly be identified with the industrialised countries and the countries in transition; the non-Annex B group \nconsists of the developing countries. \n3 The other flexibility mechanisms are when-flexibility and where-flexibility. When-flexibility relates to the timing of reductions \n(in the 2008-2012 period). Where-flexibility means that countries can accomplish part of their reduction abroad, through \nemission trading or setting up reduction projects in other countries (via Joint Implementation or the Clean Development \nMechanism). \n4 For an explanation of the unit for measuring emission volumes, see the Box on page 10. \n5 Notable exceptions are Manne and Richels (2001) and Hyman et al. (2002).   10 \nprices, effects on terms of trade and on the investment in and depletion of fossil fuel resources. \nFinally, welfare analysis is not possible in a partial equilibrium approach. The economic costs \nmeasured as the area under a partial equilibrium MAC-curve are not consistent with equivalent \nvariation, the welfare measure that is commonly used in assessing policy costs.  \nMeasuring greenhouse gas emissions \nThe Kyoto Protocol covers six different greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) \nand three F-gases (HFC, PFC and SF6). The emission targets in the Kyoto protocol apply to the aggregate of these six \ngases. These gases differ in their Global Warming Potential (GWP), i.e. their effect on radiative forcing. The GWP of a \ngreenhouse gas is defined as the ratio of the cumulative radiative forcing that would result from the emissions of one \nkilogram of that gas to that from emission of one kilogram of carbon dioxide over a period of time (usually 100 years). \nThe table below (derived from Jensen et al., 2001) presents the GWPs of the different gases. \nEmission volumes are thus commonly expressed in carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2-equivalents): the metric volume \ntimes the GWP. For instance, the emission of 1 ton of methane has the same impact on radiative forcing as 21 ton of \nCO2. Carbon dioxide equivalents can easily be converted to carbon equivalents (Ceq) by multiplying the carbon dioxide \nequivalents by 12/44 (the ratio of the molecular weight of carbon to carbon dioxide). \n \nTable: Kyoto greenhouse gases, Global Warming Potential and main emission sources \nGreenhouse gas  GWP  Emission sources \n     \nCO2  1  Combustion of fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas) \nCH4  21  Cattle and manure, rice, natural gas, waste and fuel losses/leakage \nN2O  310  Agricultural soils, fertilizer and industrial production (adipic and nitric acid) \nHFCs\na  140-11700  Air conditioning and foam blowing \nPFCs\na  6200-9200  Aluminium and semiconductors \nSF6  23900  Magnesium, semiconductors and electrical switchgear \n \na\n Differences across regions exist due to the composition of the F-gases. \n \n  \n \nFor these reasons, we have incorporated the abatement of methane and nitrous oxide as an \nendogenous component in the multi-region and multi-sector Applied General Equilibrium \n(AGE) model WorldScan (CPB, 1999).\n6 In this paper, we investigate the impact of including \nthese gases in the analysis in addition to CO2-emissions from fossil fuel combustion. The key \nfeature of our approach is that abatement of non-CO2 greenhouse gases implies a loss of \nproductivity: resources have to be diverted to abatement (cf. Hyman et al., 2002; Copeland and \nTaylor, 2003). The association of a productivity loss with abatement makes that the MAC-\ncurves are endogenously generated in our model. The difference between our approach and \nmodels in which MAC-curves are exogenous, is that in our approach, the full general \nequilibrium effects are taken into account, as the abatement costs are part of the firm\u2019s \noptimisation problem. A firm can choose to abate emissions to avoid paying a tax on these \nemissions, but this comes at the cost of reduced productivity, as resources have to be diverted to \n \n6 The so-called F-gases are not incorporated as their volume is negligibly small.   11 \nabatement. Alternatively, the firm can choose not to abate at all, paying the full emission tax. In \ngeneral, there will be an interior optimum. The bottom-up MAC-curve of the non-CO2 \ngreenhouse gases implicitly determines this optimum. Hence, our approach is consistent with \nbottom-up information, while it allows for general equilibrium effects and inter-gas \ninteractions.  \nIn the analysis, we focus on the general equilibrium marginal abatement cost curves, as \nthese indicate the cost-saving potential of including non-CO2 greenhouse gases in climate \npolicy. With this focus in mind, we perform two types of analyses. First, we decompose the \nchange in the MAC-curves in different general equilibrium effects. Subsequently, we compare \nthe costs of a multi-gas strategy to the costs of a CO2-only approach.  \nThis paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, we will first discuss the emissions in the \nbaseline scenario, focusing on the importance of non-CO2 gases in different regions and for \ndifferent sectors. This gives a first indication of the effects of extending climate policy to non-\nCO2 gases. In Section 3, we discuss the modelling of non-CO2 gases in WorldScan, with special \nemphasis on the effect of abatement on productivity. The results are presented in Section 4. \nSection 5 concludes.   12   13 \n2  Emissions \n2.1  Baseline scenario \nIn the reference or baseline scenario it is assumed that no climate policy measures are applied \nother than the current measures; it is a so-called Business-as-Usual (BaU) scenario. The impact \nof climate policy such as the effect on GDP and sectoral structure can then be determined by \ncomparing the results from the baseline scenario to the results of a scenario in which new \nmeasures are initiated. The baseline scenario is thus used as a benchmark. \nThe choice of baseline scenario is not neutral, as its characteristics have an important effect \non the estimated costs of climate policy. Firstly, the baseline emissions set the reduction \nvolume, which is defined relative to 1990 emissions. Moreover, in a baseline scenario with high \n(low) economic growth, costs will be higher (lower). Also the sectoral composition, \ntechnological change and demographic developments will have an effect on the costs of climate \npolicy. \nOur baseline scenario is built up from several partial scenarios, each providing \ncomplementary information. The economic developments and the CO2-emission projections are \ntaken from a version of the \u2018Strong Europe\u2019 scenario (CPB, 2003). In addition, projections for \nthe regional emission factors of the non-CO2 gases to predict future emission intensities are \ntaken from the A1B scenario of the IMAGE SRES scenarios (RIVM, 2001). The A1B scenario \nis consistent with the \u2018Strong Europe\u2019 scenario of CPB (2003).\n7 This A1B scenario describes a \nworld with increasing globalisation, rapid technological progress, and high economic growth. \nFinally, the projections of non-CO2 greenhouse gases for the individual EU-countries stem from \nthe Sectoral Objectives Study (Capros, Kouvaritakis and Mantzos, 2001; Hendriks et al., 2001).  \nTable 2.1 and 2.2show the composition of non-CO2 emissions in several regions. The non-\nCO2 greenhouse gases account for a considerable share in total emissions, ranging from roughly \n15% in the USA, the Rest of OECD and the EU-15 countries to even 40% in Latin America. \nThe sectoral composition of the emissions varies greatly over regions. Firstly, emissions from \nrice cultivation are only important in the WorldScan region Rest of World. Also the share of \nemissions from the production of nitric and adipic acid varies strongly over regions. Despite its \nmodest contribution to total emissions, the production of nitric and adipic acid is an important \nemission source, because of its large reduction potential at low costs, as will be discussed \nbelow. Thirdly, the share of emissions from leakages in energy production differs considerably \namong regions. Also for this source, there are substantial reduction possibilities at fairly low \ncosts. We will come back to the possible implications of the sectoral composition of emissions \nin Section 2.3. \n \n \n7 Bollen et al. (2004) also used the \u2018Strong Europe\u2019 scenario, but they derived the energy and climate developments from the \nB1 scenario of IMAGE SRES.   14 \nTable 2.1  Regional and sectoral composition of non-CO2 emissions (%) in WorldScan, 1997\na \n  USA \n \n \nEU-15 \n \n \nFormer \nSoviet \nUnion \nEastern \nEurope \n \nRest \nOECD \n \nMiddle \nEast \n \nLatin \nAmerica \n \nRest of \nWorld \n \nWorld \n \n \n                   \nLivestock  30  42  22  30  53  33  82  43  43 \nPaddy rice  1  0  1  0  5  3  2  24  11 \nLeakages coal  25  7  6  37  6  0  1  11  11 \nLeakages oil  3  1  4  1  2  12  4  1  3 \nLeakages gas  23  7  62  11  17  41  3  3  15 \nFertilizer use  13  27  5  11  12  8  7  17  14 \nAdipic and nitric acid  6  16  1  11  6  1  1  1  3 \n                   \nNon-CO2 gases  14  14  25  20  13  22  41  31  23 \n  a\n The share of the different sources is calculated relative to the total non-CO2 emissions of non-CO2 sources (weighted by their GWP) \nincluded in the model; the share of non-CO2 gases is defined relative to the sum of the non-CO2 and CO2 emissions. \nSource: WorldScan based on RIVM (2001). \n \nTable 2.2  Regional and sectoral composition of non-CO2 emissions (%) for several European countries in \nWorldScan, 1997\na\n \n \nGermany \n \nFrance \n \nGreat \nBritain \nSpain \n \nItaly \n \n Nether-\nlands \nBelgium\nb\n  \n \nRest EU \n \n                 \nLivestock  38  40  29  44  43  39  54  61 \nPaddy rice  0  0  0  0  0  0  1  1 \nLeakages coal  13  2  12  12  6  6  4  1 \nLeakages oil  1  0  1  1  0  1  0  0 \nLeakages gas  11  2  11  11  5  6  3  1 \nFertilizer use  20  37  24  27  31  16  17  33 \nAdipic and nitric acid  17  19  22  5  14  32  21  3 \n                 \nNon-CO2 gases  11  24  14  17  11  15  9  15 \n  a \nThe share of the different sources is calculated relative to the total non-CO2 emissions of non-CO2 sources (weighted by their GWP) \nincluded in the model; the share of non-CO2 gases is defined relative to the sum of the non-CO2 and CO2 emissions. \nb\n Including Luxembourg. \nSource: Capros et al. (2001) and Hendriks et al. (2001). \n \n2.2  Emissions: activity and emission intensity \nThe volume of greenhouse gas emissions depends on two distinct components: the production \nlevel and the emission intensity, i.e. the emissions per unit of output. Emissions are thus, by \ndefinition, the product of the activity level of the emission source and the emission factor: \nt r s\nF\nt r s t r s Q E E , , , , , , \u00d7 =   (2.1) \n   15 \nwith E the emission volume, E\nF the emission coefficient or emission factor and Q the activity \nlevel of the emission source. The subscripts s, r and t refer to the emission source, region and \ntime, respectively. Emission factors differ among regions, as regions differ in their production \ntechnologies and their input mix. Similarly, within a region, emission factors can change over \ntime, as technologies develop and different inputs are used. These remarks hold both for CO2 \nand for the non-CO2 gases alike. However, for CO2, the change in emission factor is modelled \nby explicitly modelling the input of different fuels, each with their own emission intensity. For \nnon-CO2, the emission intensity is influenced by a myriad of factors. For instance, emissions \nfrom paddy rice are influenced by nutrients, cultivar type and irrigation method (see e.g. \nBurniaux, 2000). It is not possible to model all these factors in WorldScan, also because of data \nproblems. Therefore, we use the emission factor as a \u2018catchall\u2019 variable.  \nThe emission factor may change in the baseline scenario without newly imposed climate \npolicy measures This change in emission factor in the baseline is called Autonomous Emission \nEfficiency Improvement; this mechanism will be discussed in Section 2.2.1. If the emission \nfactor changes as a result of climate policy, it is called Induced Technological Change. This \nmechanism is discussed in Section 2.2.2. \n2.2.1  Baseline: Autonomous Emission Efficiency Improvement \nIn the baseline, the emission coefficient may vary over time as a result of technological \ndevelopments or a change in input mix. For instance, farmers may decide to increase the share \nof sheep in their herd at the expense of cows, thus affecting the emission coefficient of \nlivestock-related sources. These changes are not prompted by some desire to decrease emissions \nbut stem from other considerations, such as technological developments, cost reduction and \nchanges in lifestyle. When the emission coefficient decreases as a result of such \u2019autonomous\u2019 \nchanges, this is called Autonomous Emission Efficiency Improvement (AEEI).  \nThe change in emission factor in the baseline scenario has been derived from the emission \nvolume and the corresponding activity levels from the IMAGE SRES scenarios (RIVM, 2001).\n8 \nTable 2.3 presents the change in emission factor in the period 1997 - 2010 for several emission \nsources.  \n \n \n8 There are small differences in the definition of WorldScan and IMAGE 2.2 emissions sources, causing some error in the \nestimates of WorldScan emission factors, but these errors are likely to be small. For the European countries, there is an \nadditional source of error. As the Sectoral Objectives Studies do not include information on activity levels, we have used the \ndata for the aggregated European Union from the IMAGE SRES scenarios as a proxy for the economic developments in the \nindividual European countries. This introduces two types of error. First of all, it is of course not justified to use \u2018toto pro pars\u2019: \nthe economic developments in the individual countries will differ from the overall average. Furthermore, the scenarios \nemployed in the Sectoral Objectives Study are not the same as the scenarios underlying the IMAGE emission projections. \nHowever, the emission factors calculated on the basis of these data look quite reasonable.   16 \nTable 2.3  Emission factor in 2010 (1997 = 100; world average) \n  Baseline emission factor  \n   \nLivestock  74.2 \nPaddy rice  85.5 \nLeakage coal  81.6 \nLeakage gas  87.5 \nLeakage oil  97.9 \nFertilizer use  100.5 \nAdipic and nitric acid   44.2 \n \nSource: WorldScan calculations on the basis of RIVM (2001). \n \nGenerally, the emission factors fall steadily over time. It should be noted that the global \naverages in Table 2.3 hide some important regional differences. For instance, the emission \nfactor from the adipic and nitric acid production falls to 27 in the USA in 2010, whereas it stays \nrelatively high at 96 for Latin America. This reflects differences in production technologies, \nabatement options, environmental policies and many other factors. \nTable 2.4 shows the combined effect of the change in emission factor and in activity level \non the emission volume for the various sources. This decomposition shows the importance of \nthe variable emission factor in determining the emission volume. The change in emission factor \ncan either compensate for or reinforce the change in activity level. Often, the emission intensity \nas measured by the emission factor falls, while sector output expands. The net effect on \nemissions depends on the relative magnitude of those effects. Generally, the emission volume \nrises in the baseline. This is in particular the case for emissions from fertilizer use, paddy rice, \noil leakage and gas leakage. \nTable 2.4  Decomposition of the global changes in emission volume in % per year for the baseline \nscenario (1997-2010) \n  Emission factor   Activity level  Emission volume \nMethane sources       \nLivestock   - 2.3  2.8  0.5 \nPaddy rice   - 1.2  2.8  1.6 \nLeakage coal   - 1.5  0.0  - 1,5 \nLeakage oil  - 0.2  1.6  1.5 \nLeakage gas  - 1.0  2.5  1.5 \n       \nNitrous oxide sources       \nFertilizer use (N2O)  0.0  4.5  4.5 \nAdipic and nitric acid (N2O)  - 6.1  4.6  - 1.5 \n \nSource: WorldScan calculations on the basis of RIVM (2001). \n \n   17 \n2.2.2  Climate policy: Induced Technological Change \nThe emission factor may also fall as a result of climate policy. In that case, a tax on emissions \ninduces firms to alter their production technology such that the emissions per unit of output fall. \nOf course, these reductions generally do not come for free. For instance, rice producers have to \ninvest in new irrigation systems (intermittent irrigation) to lower methane emissions per unit of \noutput. The information on abatement options and their costs is summarised in so-called \nMarginal Abatement Cost (MAC) curves. An important parameter for describing the MAC-\ncurves is the reduction potential, i.e. the technical limit to the share of the emissions that can be \nabated. This variable is presented in Table 2.5 for several sources and regions. The MAC-\ncurves themselves are presented in Appendix A and explained in detail in 3.1.1. The reduction \npotential in the livestock sector is set to zero, even though there are indications that there is a \npositive reduction potential (see e.g. Burniaux, 2000). However, the data are not very accurate. \nFurthermore, the reduction potential in the livestock sector is only positive for emissions from \nmanure, which only make up 7% of total livestock emissions.  \nFor all sources, except for leakages from gas production and distribution, the MAC-curves \nshow that the reduction potential is already reached at fairly low emission taxes. This implies \nthat reductions up to the reduction potential are generally cheap for non-CO2 gases. The \nreduction potentials are often substantial. Especially for N2O-emissions from adipic and nitric \nacid, the reduction potential is large: almost all emissions can be eliminated at virtually no \ncosts. Also for emissions from losses and leakages from coal mining, oil production and gas \nproduction and distribution, the reduction potential is large.  \nTable 2.5  Regional reduction potential relative to 1997 emission factor \n \nUSA \n \nEU-15 \n \nFormer \nSoviet Union \nEastern \nEurope \nRest \nOECD \nMiddle \nEast \nLatin \nAmerica \nGlobal \naverage \n                 \nLivestock\na\n  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0 \nPaddy rice  57  57  57  57  57  57  57  57 \nLeakages coal  88  52  61  73  76  86  100  80 \nLeakages oil  21  100  38  100  29  43  35  32 \nLeakages gas  56  49  43  100  55  60  59  53 \nAdipic and nitric acid  92  92  100  92  92  100  100  93 \n                  a\n The positive reduction potential for manure is ignored, as its emissions only constitute a minor fraction of total livestock emissions. \nSource: EPA (2003), Brown et al. (1999) \n   18 \n2.3  Scope for non-CO2 greenhouse gases \nIn most economic analyses of climate policy, only CO2-emissions are considered. In that case, it \nis implicitly assumed that non-CO2 greenhouse gases are reduced by the same relative amount \nas CO2 , although no costs are attached to the reduction of non-CO2 gases. By contrast, this \npaper focuses on the gains from what-flexibility, i.e. the difference in abatement costs when the \nemissions of all greenhouse gases are taxed and when only CO2-emissions are taxed for a given \nemission target. Since non-CO2 gases offer additional reduction options that are sometimes less \nexpensive than the options involving the reduction of CO2, the costs of a multi-gas strategy will \nbe equal to or lower than a strategy in which only CO2-emissions are abated.  \nHowever, the reduction potential and the reduction costs differ per emission source, so that \nthe composition of the total emission volume is an important determinant of the abatement costs \nin a region. Hence, the effect of a multi-gas strategy is expected to vary by region, as the \ncomposition of the emission volume depends on the fundamental structure of the economy. \nSection 2.1 and 2.2 give a first indication of the importance of non-CO2 greenhouse gases in \ndifferent regions. Table 2.1, 2.2 and 2.5 suggest that all regions can gain by employing a multi-\ngas strategy, though to differing degrees. For the non-Annex B regions, the share of non-CO2 \nemissions is generally high, while for the industrialised countries the share of emission sources \nwith low abatement costs is fairly high.  \nFor all regions, the scope for reduction by abating emissions from leakages in gas \nproduction and distribution is considerable. For instance, in the former Soviet Union where \nemissions from leakages in gas production and distribution account for 56% of total non-CO2 \nemissions, almost 35% of the emission volume from this source can be abated at 100 dollar per \nton carbon equivalent. For all regions, both the reduction potential and the share in total \nemissions are considerable for this source. \nWhile reducing emissions from gas leakage and production is important for all regions, \nthere are also emission sources that are especially important for a selection of regions. \nEmissions from adipic and nitric acid production are particularly important for European \ncountries, because of their huge reduction potential at almost zero cost and their substantial \nshare in emissions in these countries.   19 \n3  Non-CO2 greenhouse gases in WorldScan \n3.1  WorldScan \nTo determine the economic impact of including non-CO2 greenhouse gases in climate policy, \nthe non-CO2 emission sources have been incorporated in the applied general equilibrium (AGE) \nmodel WorldScan. More information on this model can be found in the box below and in CPB \n(1999).  \nWorldScan in a nutshell \nWorldScan  (CPB,  1999)  is  a  multi-sector,  multi-region  Applied  General  Equilibrium  (AGE)  model.  The  model  is \ndeveloped to study long-term global issues, such as globalisation and climate change policy. The model builds upon \nneoclassical theory, has strong micro-foundations and solves for the equilibrium that maximises welfare across the \nentire economy, subject to technological constraints, greenhouse gas limitations, etc. The model is calibrated on input-\noutput tables and trade data from the GTAP5 database (Dimaranan and McDougall, 2002). The base year for the model \nis 1997. Production sectors use capital, labour, natural resources and intermediate inputs (including energy) to produce \noutput. Production technologies are described by nested constant elasticity of substitution (CES) functions. \nThe version used in this study distinguishes 15 sectors and 16 regions. These are listed in the table below. The model \nthus contains considerable detail at the European level. Also the energy sectors are modelled in considerable detail. \nThe sectoral and regional classification is the same as in CPB (2003), except that the agricultural sector is split in three \nseparate sub sectors (livestock, paddy rice, other agriculture), while the sector \u2018energy intensive products\u2019 is split in two \n(chemical, rubber and plastic products and other energy intensive sectors) to host several non-CO2 emission sources. \n \nSectors and regions in WorldScan \nSectors  Regions \n   \nLivestock  Germany  \nPaddy rice  France  \nAgriculture nec\na\n  United Kingdom  \nCoal  The Netherlands \nOil  Belgium and Luxembourg \nNatural gas and gas distribution  Italy  \nMinerals nec\na\n  Spain  \nChemical, rubber and plastic products  Rest of European Union \nPetroleum and coal products  Eastern Europe  \nOther energy intensive sectors  Former Soviet Union \nConsumer good sector  Turkey  \nCapital goods and durables  United states  \nElectricity  Rest OECD \nOther services  Latin America and Mexico \nTransport  Middle East and Northern Africa \n   Rest of world \n    a\n Nec: not elsewhere classified.   \n   20 \nIn the WorldScan model, emissions are coupled to production and consumption levels. For CO2, \nthe emissions follow from the energy input into production and consumption. Carbon dioxide \nemissions are coupled proportionally to the burning of fossil fuels.\n9 As in the case of CO2, \nemissions from non-CO2 gases stem from inputs in the production process. However, because \nthe emission intensity of non-CO2 emission sources depends on many factors, the dependence \nof emissions on inputs is not modelled explicitly. Instead, the non-CO2 emissions are modelled \nby employing a variable emission factor (per source), linking emissions to output volume\n10  \nThe activities to which the non-CO2 emission sources are linked in WorldScan are given in \nTable 3.1.  \nTable 3.1  Non-CO2 emission sources and corresponding WorldScan sectors \nEmission source  WorldScan sector/activity \n   \nPaddy rice  Rice cultivation \nManure, enteric fermentation and animal waste  Livestock \nLosses in coal production and transport  Coal production \nLosses/leakage in oil production and transport  Oil production \nLosses/leakage in gas production and distribution  Gas production and distribution \nFertilizer use  Inputs of chemicals in agricultural sectors \nProduction of adipic and nitric acid  Production of chemicals \n \n In this study, we have allowed for abatement through ITC for the following sources:\n11  \n \n\u00b7  Paddy rice \n\u00b7  Losses and leakages coal mining \n\u00b7  Losses and leakages oil recovery \n\u00b7  Losses and leakages gas recovery \n\u00b7  Production of adipic and nitric acid \n\u00b7  Fertilizer use \n \n The bottom-up MAC-curves used in this study are presented in Appendix A. \n \n \n \n8 For more information on the modeling of CO2 emissions in WorldScan, see Bollen et al. (2002). \n10 There is one exception to this way of modeling emissions of non-CO2 greenhouse gases. Emissions from fertilizer use are \ntreated similar to CO2 emissions, i.e. emissions are in fixed proportion to fertilizer input in agricultural sectors, and are not \nlinked to any output level. \n11 The emissions per unit of output cannot be reduced for all emission sources. Moreover, for some sources, there are no \nreliable data available. For these sources, abatement is accomplished solely by demand shifts. For instance, while it is \npossible to reduce emissions from enteric fermentation, the estimates widely vary (Burniaux (2000) reports reduction \npotentials ranging from 5 to 60%). For that reason, abatement options for enteric fermentation are not considered. Moreover, \nabatement options for manure are ignored, as the data are inaccurate and manure emissions only make up 7% of the global \nlivestock emissions.    21 \n3.2  Climate policy \nBoth for CO2 and for the non-CO2 greenhouse gases, emission reductions are attained by \nimposing an emission price or emission tax on polluting activities. This has an effect on both \nthe activity level of production (output) and on the emission intensity (emission factor). The \nimposition of an emission tax results in higher user prices. In the production process, inputs \nwith low emission intensity will be substituted for inputs with high emission intensity. In \naddition, the demand for emission-intensive products will fall.  \nThere are several ways to endogenise pollution control for non-CO2 greenhouse gases, \nwhich are summarised in the box below. In our model, actors can choose between paying an \nemission tax and abating the emissions. Emission abatement comes at some cost, however, as \nresources have to be diverted to abatement. The optimal mix is thus determined by the \nparticular MAC-curve. \nHow to model non-CO2 abatement? \nNon-CO2 abatement can be modelled in several ways. One option is to include an abatement sector in the model. The \nabatement  sector  employs  capital,  labour  and  intermediate  inputs  to  reduce  emissions.  This  approach  allows  for \nflexibility in the factor shares of various abatement activities. A disadvantage of this approach, however, is that many \nabatement sectors would need to be modelled, as there are multiple abatement technologies for the different gases. \nMoreover, this method requires detailed data on the abatement technologies, which is currently not available in the form \nsuitable for an AGE-model such as WorldScan.  \nAn alternative approach would be to allow for an alternative production process for e.g. rice that is less emission \nintensive than the original technology but comes at a higher cost, as resources have to be spent on pollution control. \nAgain, the limitation of this approach is that there are many alternative production activities, each with its own emission \nintensity. This implies that a large number of production functions need to be introduced to represent the changes in \nproduction costs and emission intensity.  \nA third approach is to model emissions as an input to the production, as in Hyman et al., 2002. While this approach is \nquite common in the analytical general equilibrium models (see e.g. Copeland and Taylor, 2002), there are some \nnumerical problems when this approach is pursued in AGE modelling.\na\n  \nHere,  we  follow  a  more  direct,  though  similar  approach.  Emissions  are  modelled  in  the  traditional  way,  as  an \nundesirable output of production. Similar to Hyman et al., however, the fall in productivity associated with abatement is \ntaken into account. Firms can thus choose between investing in pollution control (accepting a lower productivity) or \npaying higher emission taxes, as with CO2. Generally, it will be optimal to abate part of the emissions, paying the \nemission tax over the remainder. \n \na\n The emission price function exhibits a discontinuity at P\nE = 0.  \n \nThe marginal abatement costs from bottom-up MAC-curves are partial equilibrium prices. \nThese MAC-curves can be used to calculate the general equilibrium marginal abatement costs \nin an AGE-model such as WorldScan. The partial equilibrium MAC-curves describe the scope \nfor Induced Technological Change (ITC) in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.   22 \nAbatement is achieved by lowering the emission intensity (emissions per unit of activity) of \nproduction. The emission factor thus declines with the imposition of an emission price. By \ndefinition it holds that \n( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) E ITC A E E\nF\nE\nF P r r P r with P r E P r E + = - \u00d7 = , 1 ,  (3.1) \nwith  F E the emission factor in the base year, and r the reduction as a function of the emission \nprice PE. The reduction r is the sum of the reduction as a result of climate policy (rITC) and the \nautonomous reduction in the baseline (rA).  \nHowever, emission reductions through ITC do not come for free. Total Factor Productivity \n(TFP) of sectors producing non-CO2 greenhouse gases will be lowered as a result of diverting \npart of the production of e.g. the livestock sector to emission abatement. The firm thus needs to \ndecide which share of its resources to use for abatement. The optimum abatement level follows \nfrom profit maximisation.\n12 Assuming that emissions are taxed at production, the profit of the \nfirm becomes: \n( ) Q r E P Q c Q A p\nF\nE \u00d7 - \u00d7 \u00d7 - \u00d7 - \u00d7 \u00d7 = P 1 ,  (3.2) \nwhere p is the producer price, A denotes the productivity with A = 1 for rITC = 0, Q is the activity \nlevel, c is the marginal cost at this activity level, and PE is the emission price. We assume that \nproductivity is a decreasing and concave function of the emission reduction rITC : the more \nresources are diverted to abatement, the less output is available for sale. The first order \ncondition for the optimal reduction level reads: \n0 ' = \u00d7 \u00d7 + \u00d7 \u00d7 =\n\u00b6\nP \u00b6\nQ E P Q A p\nr\nF\nE\nITC\n  (3.3) \nThe firm chooses the optimal abatement level, maximising its profits. We assume free entry of \nfirms and thus zero profits. Together with a postulated form for PE(rITC), Equations (3.2) and \n(3.3) yield a differential equation for the productivity A as a function of rITC. A particular simple \nparameterisation for rITC(PE) is: \n( ) ( )\n0 , \u00b3\n+\n-\n= E\nE\nforP\nP\nr P\nP r A E\nE ITC d\ne\n  (3.4a) \nwith the inverse function: \n \n12 More details on the derivation can be found in Appendix B.   23 \n( ) ( )\nA ITC\nITC A\nITC\nITC E r r\nr r\nr\nr P - < \u00a3\n- -\n\u00d7\n= e\ne\nd\n0   for ,     \n) (\n  (3.4b) \nwith \u03b5 denoting the technical limit to the possible emission reduction, \u03b4 the speed of \nconvergence , and rA the reduction through autonomous emission efficiency improvement. \nHence, Equation (3.4) describes the partial equilibrium MAC-curve. With this parameterisation \nof the MAC-curve, we get the following expression for the total factor productivity: \n( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) s\nl\nl f s\nl f s\ne l f h 2\n2\n2 2 2 / 1\n-\n\uf8f7 \uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec \uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n+ \u00d7 \u00d7 -\n- \u00d7 \u00d7 +\n\u00d7 \u00d7 - + \u00d7 + - \u00d7 =\nITC\nITC\nA ITC ITC ITC r\nr\nc r r r r A   (3.5) \nwith \n( ) ( ) ( ) ; 4 ; 1 ;\n2 / 1 2 l e f s f l d f + - \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 = - - \u00d7 = \u00d7 = A A\nF r c c r E    \nand h a constant of integration following from the constraint A(0) = 1. Considering the relation \nbetween the parameters \u03b5 and the \u03b4 and the TFP-level gives some more insight in the \nimplications of Equation (3.5). For a fixed emission price, the emission reduction will be larger \nfor a larger \u03b5 or a smaller \u03b4 (see Equation (3.4)). Larger emission reductions will be associated \nwith higher costs and thus a lower level of TFP. \nFigure 3.1 shows the fit of a particular bottom-up MAC-curve\n13 (leakages from coal mining \nin the USA) based on Equation (3.4). Figure 3.2 shows the corresponding productivity function \nA. The MAC-curve and the productivity curves are thus convex and concave functions of the \nrelative reduction r, respectively. The emission factor declines as a function of the emission \nprice and approaches the minimum dictated by the MAC-curve for an emission price going to \ninfinity. The two figures show that considerable emission reductions are already reached at \nfairly low prices, while TFP has only decreased by 3% at the reduction potential.  \n \n13  All bottom-up MAC-curves are taken from the EPA (2003) (using the base energy price scenario, assuming a 5% \ndiscount rate and a zero tax rate), except for the MAC-curves for paddy rice and fertilizer use, which are taken from Brown \net al. (1999).  \n   24 \nFigure 3.1  Fit of bottom-up MAC-curve \n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\n0 0,2 0,4 0,6 0,8 1\nRelative emission reduction r\nE\nm\ni\ns\ns\ni\no\nn\n \np\nr\ni\nc\ne\n \n(\nU\nS\n$\n/\nt\nC\ne\nq\n)\ndata points\nfitted curve\n \n \n \nFigure 3.2  Productivity of a sector as a function of the relative reduction \n0,9\n0,92\n0,94\n0,96\n0,98\n1\n0 0,2 0,4 0,6 0,8 1\nRelative emission reduction r\nP\nr\no\nd\nu\nc\nt\ni\no\nn\n \ne\nf\nf\ni\nc\ni\ne\nn\nc\ny\n \nA\n \n \n \n   25 \nUsing the parameterisation of the MAC-curves, the model calculates the general equilibrium \nmarginal abatement cost curves. These curves contain both effects of the imposition of an \nemission tax: (1) the decline of the emissions per unit of output and (2) the shift of demand to \nother products or to imports from countries with lower or no emission taxes. The fall in \nproductivity leads to an increase in production costs. Firms can thus choose between paying the \nemission tax and investing in pollution control, accepting a lower productivity. In general, it \nwill be optimal to abate part of the emissions, paying the emission tax over the remainder. The \noptimum is derived from the partial equilibrium MAC-curves. This approach thus integrates the \nbottom-up information from bottom-up MAC-curves with a general equilibrium approach. \nOur approach is similar to both that of Burniaux (2000) and Brown et al. (1999) in the use \nof an emission response function (Equation (3.4)). However, our model differs from their \napproaches in one important respect. Both Burniaux (2000) and Brown et al. (1999) attach no \ncosts to this induced technological change. In our model, productivity falls if the reduction \neffort increases. This reflects deployment of resources for abatement. In this respect, our \napproach is similar to that of Hyman et al. (2002) and to that of Copeland and Taylor (2003), \nwho model emissions as an input to production. In their formulation this leads to a difference \nbetween potential output and true output, i.e. productivity falls.  \nSeveral points can be noted about the parameterisation of the MAC-curve. Firstly, the \nreductions from autonomous emission efficiency improvement (AEEI) have to be subtracted \nfrom the MAC-curves, as these options are no longer available. The specification (3.4) thus \nforces the MAC-curve to intersect the x-axis (P\nE =0) at the point r = rA . As the reduction share \nthrough AEEI generally changes over time, the corresponding MAC-curve will also shift.  \nTable 3.2 gives an indication of the importance of AEEI. For example, for the EU-15 only \n30% of the abatement options are left after subtracting the reduction volume accomplished by \nAEEI for the three major emission sources (leakages from coal and gas production and \nproduction of adipic and nitric acid). \nTable 3.2  Percentage of the reduction options left after AEEI correction in 2010 \n \nUSA \n \nEU-15 \n \nFormer \nSoviet Union \nEastern \nEurope \nRest \nOECD \nMiddle \nEast \nLatin \nAmerica \nRest of \nWorld \n                 \nPaddy rice  64  65  88  78  101  88  66  74 \nLeakages coal  94  33  71  102  57  42  113  65 \nLeakages oil  173  49  88  88  145  58  129  89 \nLeakages gas  98  28  93  56  94  66  87  114 \nAdipic and nitric acid  21  36  56  62  24  70  96  84 \n                 \n   26 \nThis reduces the scope for reductions through Induced Technological Change in the long run. \nThis is shown in Figure 3.3 for emissions from the production of nitric and adipic acid in the \nformer Soviet Union. The figure shows how the MAC-curve shifts over time, as more and more \noptions are exhausted under AEEI. Taking 1997 as a reference point, autonomous emission \nreductions increase from 0 to 0.384 in 2010 and 0.595 in 2020. \nFigure 3.3  Shift of MAC-curve of emissions from the production of nitric and adipic acid in the former Soviet \nUnion for different portions of AEEI \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n0 0,2 0,4 0,6 0,8 1 1,2\nRelative emission reduction r\nE\nm\ni\ns\ns\ni\no\nn\n \np\nr\ni\nc\ne\n \n(\nU\nS\n$\n/\nt\nC\ne\nq\n)\nAEEI = 0.\nAEEI = .4\nAEEI = .6\n \nSecondly, several partial MAC-curves include negative cost abatement options.\n14 Part of these \nreductions or even all can be consumed in the baseline, depending on the magnitude of the \nautonomous emission efficiency improvement. We assume positive costs for the no-regret \noptions that are left after subtraction of the autonomous reductions. This reflects the view that \nthe non-adoption of these techniques in the baseline indicates that the costs are positive in \npractice. An important reason is that transaction costs may not have been fully accounted for, so \nthat abatement options with negative costs actually present net positive costs. Also, some actors \nmay not be aware of the existence of negative cost options, as the returns are likely to be small \nin the baseline. Acquiring this information also represents a form of costs, which are in general \nnot included in MAC-curves.  \nA third issue is the emission reduction in the limit of an infinite emission price. There are \ntwo possible views. Our parameterisation assumes that even in the limit of infinite costs, only a \nfraction of the emissions can be abated. However, one could also argue that the introduction of \n \n14 Negative cost options denote that emission reductions go hand in hand with overall efficiency improvement, leading to \nnegative net costs. A well-known example is the capture and sale of methane in natural gas production (EPA, 2001). It is \ncommonly assumed that these \u2018no regret\u2019 options are not implemented in the absence of climate policy because of factors \nsuch as transaction costs and information problems.   27 \nclimate policy will stimulate the development of new abatement options, as in Hyman et al \n(2002).\n15 At high enough emission prices, this will lead to more reduction options in the longer \nrun. However, the course of the MAC-curve is then hard to predict, as also the curvature of the \nMAC-curves for lower emission prices is likely to change. Therefore, we have adopted the \nconservative approach, assuming a fixed reduction potential. For the short run, this seems to be \na reasonable approach. \nFourthly, an important parameter is the price elasticity of reduction through ITC, which is \ngoverned by the parameter \u03b4.\n16 For all sources, except for leakages from gas production and \ndistribution, the reduction potential is already reached at fairly low emission taxes (a low value \nof \u03b4). This implies that reductions up to the reduction potential are generally cheap for non-CO2 \ngases. Equation (3.4) and Figure 3.3 show that with an increase in the autonomous emission \nefficiency index (rA), the abatement curve will fall below the curve of the base year. This \nreflects the intuition that abatement options generally will become cheaper over time.  \nA final point is that, in our general equilibrium framework, there will be spillover effects \nbetween the different gases. For instance, when reducing CO2 in the coal sector, also methane \nemissions from coal production are reduced. The importance of these so-called co-benefits will \nbe assessed in the next section.  \n \n15 The bottom-up MAC-curves only use currently existing abatement technologies or technologies which are incremental \nimprovements on current technologies.  \n16 To be precise, the price elasticity of the ITC reduction is equal to \u03b4 / (\u03b4 + P\nE).   28   29 \n4  Results \nThe focus of this study is twofold. Firstly, we want to assess the impact of general equilibrium \neffects on marginal abatement costs. Secondly, this study examines the scope of what-flexibility \nfor cost reductions. For both purposes, the general equilibrium MAC-curves provide useful \ninsights. In Section 4.1, the impact of general equilibrium effects on marginal abatement costs \nis explored. In Section 4.2, we look at the effect of employing a multi-gas strategy instead of a \npolicy directed at CO2 only. \n4.1  Decomposition of the general equilibrium effects \nThe previous section provides the building blocks for the decomposition of the general \nequilibrium effects. General equilibrium MAC-curves can be constructed by imposing different \nemission price levels for all regions and then determining the emission reductions.\n17 We \nconsider the year 2010, when the Kyoto Protocol is in full effect. We do not allow for emission \ntrading, as we want to focus on the effect of what-flexibility in different regions separately. \nFor the decomposition of the MAC-curves, we performed several simulations with the \nWorldScan model. The partial relation between the emission price and non-CO2 reduction is \nimposed a priori by Equation (3.4). In a first simulation we constructed a general equilibrium \nMAC-curve for CO2 by imposing an emission tax on CO2-emissions only. Also non-CO2 \nemissions are reduced in that case, as a tax on CO2 may reduce output from sectors that also \nemit non-CO2 gases. These are the so-called co-benefits. In a second simulation, an emission \nprice was imposed on non-CO2 gases only. This simulation gives us information about the \ngeneral equilibrium MAC-curve of non-CO2 and the accompanying CO2 co-benefits. As a final \nexperiment the emission tax was imposed on all greenhouse gases, leading to the full general \nequilibrium MAC-curve. \nFigure 4.1 and 4.2 present the cumulative MAC-curves for two different regions based on \nthe simulations described above. Figure 4.1 shows the cumulative MAC-curves for the former \nSoviet Union, while Figure 4.2 presents these for the EU-15. The reason to focus on these two \nregions is that they represent the two extreme cases. For the former Soviet Union, general \nequilibrium effects are considerable, while these effects are only modest for the EU-15. General \nequilibrium effects in other regions are less pronounced than in the former Soviet Union, but \nstronger than for the EU-15. \n The general equilibrium MAC-curve for all greenhouse gases can be decomposed into a \npart due to non-CO2 greenhouse gases (the area left from the non-CO2 general equilibrium \ncurve) and a part due to CO2 (the area right from the non-CO2 general equilibrium curve). This \ngeneral equilibrium MAC-curve for non-CO2 greenhouse gases can be further decomposed into \n \n17 We have considered the imposition of an emission price in all regions simultaneously. Alternatively, we could have \nimposed an emission price in a single country at the time. This will not change our results qualitatively.   30 \nthree components: co-benefits from CO2, a partial equilibrium effect and a general equilibrium \neffect. The first curve on the left represents these non-CO2 co-benefits resulting from an \nemission tax on CO2 only. The second line from the left shows the cumulative effect of these \nco-benefits and the partial non-CO2 MAC-curve. The area between the second and third MAC-\ncurve gives the general equilibrium effect, i.e. the emission reduction resulting from demand \nshifts due to higher producer prices. Thirdly, the general equilibrium MAC-curve for CO2 can \nbe decomposed into CO2 co-benefits from an emission tax on non-CO2 and CO2 reductions \nresulting from general equilibrium effects of an emission tax on CO2.  \nFigure 4.1 shows, that for the former Soviet Union the different components of the full \ngeneral equilibrium MAC-curve all constitute a substantial share. For the former Soviet Union, \nthe most important source of non-CO2 emissions is leakage from gas production and \ndistribution, representing 62% of total non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions (Table 2.1). The \nreduction potential for this source is high: after correction for autonomous emission efficiency \nimprovement the reduction potential is still 40% in 2010 (Table 3.2). In addition, even at higher \nemission prices, induced technological change offers several abatement options. Finally, the gas \nsector is also an important source of CO2-emissions, explaining the sizeable co-benefits. \nFigure 4.1  Decomposition of the non-CO2 contribution to emission reductions in the former Soviet Union \n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\n350\n400\n450\n0 100 200 300 400 500\nEmission reduction in MTCeq\nE\nm\ni\ns\ns\ni\no\nn\n \np\nr\ni\nc\ne\n \n(\nU\nS\n$\n/\nT\nC\ne\nq\n)\nNon-CO2 co-benefits\nNon-CO2 partial MAC\nNon-CO2 general equilibrium\nCO2 co-benefits\nGHG general equilibrium\n \nFigure 4.2 shows the cumulative MAC-curve for the 15 EU-countries. In contrast with the \nformer Soviet Union, the contribution of non-CO2 gases is negligible for the EU-15. There is \nonly a modest demand shift for the non-CO2 greenhouse gases. Again, these results can be \nexplained on the basis of the relative importance of non-CO2 gases and their marginal \nabatement costs. Table 2.1 shows that only 31% of the non-CO2 greenhouse gases in the EU-15 \nare produced in sectors with a considerable reduction potential for induced technological   31 \nchange. For the remainder (emissions from livestock and fertilizer use), reductions have to \ncome solely from demand shifts. Moreover, in the agricultural sectors the co-benefits obviously \nwill be modest. Furthermore, Table 3.2 shows that after correction for AEEI in the baseline only \none third of the ITC reduction potential is left. Therefore, the net reduction potential from \ninduced technological change is modest, and it is completely depleted at low emission prices.  \nFigure 4.2  Decomposition of the non-CO2 contribution to emission reductions in the EU-15 \n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\n350\n400\n450\n0 100 200 300 400 500\nEmission reduction in MTCeq\nE\nm\ni\ns\ns\ni\no\nn\n \np\nr\ni\nc\ne\n \n(\nU\nS\n$\n/\nT\nC\ne\nq\n)\nNon-CO2 co-benefits\nNon-CO2 partial MAC\nNon-CO2 general equilibrium\nCO2 co-benefits\nGHG general equilibrium\n \nFigure 4.3 shows the importance of non-CO2 greenhouse gases in total abatement at different \nemission prices for the different regions. For all regions, the share of non-CO2 gases falls with \nhigher emission prices . This shows that low-cost abatement options for non-CO2 gases are \nexhausted at intermediate emission prices. Non-CO2 greenhouse gases thus offer low-cost \nabatement options, lowering abatement costs, but once these options are exhausted, abatement \nhas to come from CO2 again.  \nHowever, as shown in the next section, abatement of non-CO2 gases can lower abatement \ncosts substantially for all regions, although the size of the cost reduction varies over regions. \nFor the former Soviet Union, the share of non-CO2 gases in total reductions is initially high, and \nremains high at higher emission prices because of the large potential for reductions through ITC \nand the considerable co-benefits. The same holds for Eastern Europe and Latin America, though \nthe shares of non-CO2 gases are somewhat lower for these regions. For the EU-15, the USA and \nespecially the Rest of the OECD, on the other hand, the share of non-CO2 gases in total \nreduction is modest and declines rapidly at higher cost levels. For these regions, the abatement \noptions through ITC are limited, especially at higher emission prices. Firstly, the \u2018low hanging \nfruit\u2019 is already reaped in the baseline, as production in these developed countries is already \nrelatively emission extensive for non-CO2 gases, so that the reduction potential is limited.   32 \nSecondly, most of the non-CO2 emissions in these regions stem from sources for which there is \nno or only limited reduction potential to start with.  \nFigure 4.3  Share of non-CO2 greenhouse gas emission reductions in the total reductions for different \nemission prices (PE = 10 $/tCeq and PE = 400 $/tCeq). \n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\nUSA EU-15 FSU Eastern\nEurope\nRest OESO Middle East Latin\nAmerica\nRest World\nN\no\nn\n-\nC\nO\n2\n \ns\nh\na\nr\ne\n 10 US$/TCeq\n400 US$/TCeq\n \n4.2  Economic impacts of including non-CO2 gases \nIn this section, we compare two cases. In the first case, we impose an emission target on all \ngreenhouse gases, while climate policy is only directed at CO2. In the second case, the target is \nthe same as in the first case, but now climate policy is aimed at CO2 as well as methane and \nnitrous oxide. This gives us an estimate for the gains from what-flexibility. We expect these \ngains to be positive, as a multi-gas strategy allows for a cost-minimising distribution of \nabatement efforts over CO2 and non-CO2 greenhouse gases.  \nIn Section 4.2.1 and 4.2.2, we describe the regional and sectoral pattern when only CO2-\nemissions are abated. In Section 4.2.3 and 4.2.4, we discuss the changes in these patterns when \na multi-gas strategy is applied. In both cases, it is assumed that the Kyoto targets are \nimplemented in all so-called Annex B countries (including the USA and Australia that have not \nratified the Protocol) except for the former Soviet Union. The former Soviet Union is excluded \nas this country faces negative emission targets. This so-called \u2018hot air\u2019 would reduce overall \ncosts and reduction levels greatly. The targets are applied to all countries simultaneously. \nFurthermore, we do not allow for emission trading, as we want to focus on the effect of \nincluding non-CO2 gases in the analysis. The focus is on the year 2010, which lies in the middle \nof the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol (2008- 2012).   33 \n4.2.1  Abatement of CO2 only: regional effects\n18 \nClimate policy has a differential impact on the different regions. These regional effects of CO2 \nabatement are shown in Table 4.1. \nTable 4.1  Regional effects of CO2-only abatement in percentage change relative to baseline in 2010 \n  CO2 emissions  Non-CO2 \nemissions \nMarginal \nabatement costs in \nUS$/tCeq\nb\n \nGDP per capita \n         \nGermany  - 8.1  - 1.9  42.3  - 0.1 \nFrance  - 7.7  - 0.6  57.9  - 0.1 \nUnited Kingdom  - 13.4  - 3.4  77.2  - 0.3 \nThe Netherlands  - 14.1\n \n- 3.6  84.9  - 0.5 \nBelgium and Luxembourg  - 19.3  - 4.2  134.9  - 0.8 \nItaly  - 10.6  - 1.5  84.3  - 0.4 \nSpain  - 2.1  - 1.0  13.1   0.0 \nRest of Europe  - 7.3  - 0.4  46.6  - 0.2 \nUSA  - 18.9  - 8.6  67.6  - 0.2 \nRest OECD  - 8.6  - 2.1  38.3  - 0.1 \nEastern Europe  0.3  - 0.4  0.0  0.1 \nFormer Soviet Union\na  0.3  - 0.6  -  - 0.0 \nMiddle East and Northern Africa\na\n  0.6  - 0.9  -  - 0.1 \nTurkey\na\n  0.4  - 0.1  -  0.1 \nLatin America\na\n  0.7  - 0.2  -  0.1 \nRest of World\na\n  0.3  - 0.1  -  0.1 \n          a\n Region without reduction commitment \nb\n Absolute change relative to baseline  \n \nThere is substantial regional variations in marginal abatement costs, with costs ranging from 0 \nUS$/tCeq in Eastern Europe to 134.9 US$/tCeq in Belgium and Luxemburg, implying that there \nis quite some scope for emission trading. Furthermore, we see that there are sizeable non-CO2 \nco-benefits for some regions such as the USA, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and \nBelgium and Luxembourg, but smaller co-benefits in other regions. Finally, the fall in per \ncapita GDP is only modest. GDP per capita even rises for some non-Annex B countries. Not \nsurprisingly, the fall in GDP per capita is the largest for the countries with high marginal \nabatement costs. The main cause of the fall in per capita GDP in Annex B regions is the \nintroduction of inefficiencies by the imposition of an emission tax. The inefficiencies are caused \nby sectoral restructuring which lowers overall productivity. \nGDP per capita also falls in some of the regions without reduction commitments, such as the \nMiddle East and Northern Africa and the former Soviet Union. These regions are large \nexporters of fossil fuels, so that they are hurt by the fall in demand for fossil fuels resulting \nfrom the imposition of an emission tax in Annex B countries. The costs of climate policy are \nthus partly shifted to these regions. \n \n18 For a more elaborate analysis of the impact of CO2-only policy, see Bollen et al. (2002) and Bollen et al. (2001).   34 \nHowever, there are also regions which benefit from climate policy, such as the WorldScan \nregion \u201cRest of World\u201d. As a result of an increase in the producer prices of energy intensive \nproducts in Annex B regions, the competitiveness of non-Annex B regions improves. The \nenergy intensive sectors in these regions thus expand, leading to so-called carbon leakage: the \nemissions of CO2 in these regions increase, as can be seen in Table 4.1.  \n4.2.2  Abatement of CO2 only: sectoral effects \nThe sectoral effects of the imposition of an emission tax on CO2 emissions are presented in \nTable 4.2 for a selection of sectors and regions. \nThe imposition of an emission tax leads to substitution between products and sectors. \nFirstly, within the class of energy carriers, energy carriers with high carbon content such as coal \nwill be substituted for energy carriers with lower carbon content such as gas and petrol. Indeed \nwe see in Table 4.2 that the coal sector generally loses most.  \nTable 4.2  Sectoral effects of CO2 reductions (percentage change in value added relative to baseline in \n2010) \n  Germany  France  USA  Former \nSoviet Union\na\n \nMiddle East \nand Northern \nAfrica\na\n \nRest of \nWorld\na\n \n             \nCoal  - 23.3  - 30.5  - 33.0  - 1.1  - 4.0  - 1.7 \nOil products  - 4.0  - 5.1  - 17.6  0.5  1.7  1.1 \nGas  - 6.0  - 7.8  - 10.7  - 1.7  - 2.0  - 1.1 \nOil  - 8.8  - 4.0  - 15.0  - 2.1  - 3.4  - 6.3 \nElectricity  - 3.0  - 0.8  - 8.9  0.4  0.3  0.2 \nEnergy intensive products  - 0.1  0.0  - 0.2  0.3  0.4  0.2 \nChemical products  - 0.1  - 0.0  - 0.7  0.5  0.7  0.4 \nTransport  - 0.3  - 0.6  - 2.3  0.8  1.2  0.6 \nRice  - 1.0  - 1.1  - 1.0  0.4  0.8  0.2 \nLivestock  0.3  0.3  0.3  0.3  0.7  0.1 \nRest agriculture  0.2  0.3  - 0.6  0.5  1.0  0.2 \nServices  0.1  0.1  0.4  - 0.0  0.0  0.0 \n             \nMacro GDP  - 0.1  - 0.1  - 0.2  - 0.0  - 0.1  0.1 \n              a\n Region without reduction commitment. \n \nSecondly, within a region, energy carriers will be substituted for other production factors or \nproducts. In production, energy carriers will be substituted for labour and capital, while \nconsumption will shift from energy intensive products to services. Indeed the service sector and \nsome agricultural sectors expand in Annex B regions, while the share of energy intensive \nsectors such as transport, chemical products and electricity declines in Annex B regions.  \nFinally, there will be international substitution as the production of energy intensive goods will \nrelocate to non-Annex B regions (carbon leakage), as Table 4.2 shows. The energy intensive \nsectors expand in these regions, and the fall in demand for energy carriers has less severe   35 \nconsequences for these regions than for the Annex B countries. The size of this latter effect \ndepends on import and export taxes, substitution effects between foreign and domestic products \nand on transport costs. \n4.2.3  Multi-gas strategy: regional effects \nFor the second simulation, the same targets are imposed as in the CO2-only variant discussed in \nSection 4.2.1 and 4.2.2, but now climate policy is directed at carbon dioxide as well as at the \nnon-CO2 greenhouse gases. The regional effects of a multi-gas strategy relative to a CO2-only \npolicy are presented in Table 4.3. The additional reduction options from non-CO2 gases have \nseveral effects. Firstly, the fall in GDP per capita is generally lower than in the case of CO2-\nonly policy. Moreover, marginal abatement costs fall considerably in most regions. This reflects \nthe availability of cheap abatement options for non-CO2 emissions. However, this decline varies \nacross regions because of regional differences in the availability of abatement options.  \nTable 4.3                Regional effects of a multi-gas strategy (percentage relative to CO2-only policy in 2010) \n  CO2 emissions  Non-CO2 \nemissions \nMarginal \nabatement costs \n in US$/tCeq\nb\n \nGDP per capita \n         \nGermany  1.9  - 15.8  - 12.0  0.0 \nFrance  3.8  - 12.9  - 30.3  0.1 \nUnited Kingdom  3.0  - 20.2  - 21.8  0.1 \nThe Netherlands  3.8  - 22.5  - 25.9  0.2 \nBelgium and Luxembourg  2.1  - 18.1  - 19.1  0.1 \nItaly  1.5  - 12.5  - 14.7  0.1 \nSpain  1.0  - 5.0  - 6.2  0.0 \nRest of Europe  1.0  - 4.8  - 7.8  0.0 \nUSA  7.6  - 22.5  - 19.6  0.0 \nRest OECD  1.5  - 9.8  - 8.4  0.0 \nEastern Europe  - 0.1  0.6  0.0  - 0.1 \nFormer Soviet Union\na  - 0.1  0.5  -  0.0 \nMiddle East and Northern Africa\na\n  - 0.1  0.8  -  0.0 \nTurkey\na\n  - 0.1  0.5  -  - 0.0 \nLatin America\na\n  - 0.1  0.3  -  0.0 \nRest of World\na\n  - 0.0  0.2  -  - 0.0 \n \na\n Region without reduction commitment. \nb\n Change in level compared to the baseline \n   36 \nThirdly, the required abatement targets for CO2 fall as a result of the availability of low-costs \nabatement options for the non-CO2 gases. In some cases, CO2-emissions are even allowed to \nrise relative to the CO2-only case. This effect is particularly important for the industrialised \ncountries. In the industrialised countries, the share of non-CO2 gases in the total reduction \nvolume is higher than their total emission share. This implies that CO2-emissions need not fall \nas much as in the CO2-only case. However, this effect is only important at moderate emission \nprices, since at higher abatement volumes, the low-cost abatement options for non-CO2 \nemissions quickly become exhausted (see also Section 4.1 for an illustration of this point for the \nEU-15). All together, the Annex B regions benefit somewhat from the inclusion of non-CO2 \ngreenhouse gases. \n4.2.4  Multi-gas strategy: sectoral effects \nThe sectoral effects for a selection of regions and sectors are presented in Table 4.4. Several \neffects play a role when climate policy is also directed at the non-CO2 greenhouse gases. \nFirstly, a larger part of the burden will fall on the agricultural sector than in the case of a CO2-\nonly policy. The imposition of an emission tax leads to a price increase in this sector. The price \nincrease in turn leads to a fall in demand and hence to a lower production in Annex B regions. \nThe demand for these products partly shifts to non-Annex B regions, and partly to other \nproducts. Indeed, the share of agricultural sectors in the Annex B countries is lower than in the \nCO2-only case.\n19 Also the share of the gas sector in total value added is now reduced, for the \nsame reason. In the non-Annex B regions, the share of agriculture and gas production is now \nhigher as compared to the CO2-only policy.  \nSecondly, the output price of energy sectors does not rise as much as in the CO2-only case, \nas part of the burden is now borne by sectors that produce non-CO2 gases. Table 4.4 shows that \nthe share of oil products is now higher than in the CO2-only case. \nFor the coal sector , both opposing effects play a role. While there is a negative effect on \nproduction due to the tax on non-CO2 related emissions, there is also a positive effect on \nproduction, as the tax on CO2-related emissions is now lower than in the case of a policy \ndirected solely at CO2. \n \n19 This effect appears to be especially large for the rice sector. However, this is merely an artifact, as rice production is \nalmost zero in the Annex B countries, so that small absolute fluctuations in the production volume give rise to a large relative \neffect.   37 \nTable 4.4  Sectoral effects of a multi-gas strategy (percentage change in value added relative to CO2-only \nstrategy in 2010) \n  Germany  France  USA  Former \nSoviet Union\na\n \nMiddle East \nand Northern \nAfrica\na\n \nRest of \nWorld\na\n \n             \nCoal  3.9  - 7.0  7.9  0.4  2.3  0.7 \nOil products  1.2  3.4  5.0  - 0.1  - 0.4  - 0.3 \nGas  - 6.5  - 10.0  - 2.0  1.0  1.4  1.1 \nOil  1.2  0.7  1.6  0.5  0.9  1.8 \nElectricity  0.8  0.5  2.0  - 0.1  - 0.1  - 0.1 \nEnergy intensive products  0.1  0.1  0.1  - 0.1  - 0.1  - 0.1 \nChemical products  - 0.1  - 0.1  - 0.0  - 0.1  - 0.2  - 0.1 \nTransport  0.1  0.6  0.7  - 0.3  - 0.4  - 0.2 \nRice  - 6.0  - 6.1  - 4.2  0.1  0.0  0.1 \nLivestock  - 1.8  - 0.8  - 4.3  0.2  0.4  0.3 \nRest agriculture  - 0.5  - 0.6  - 1.1  0.1  0.0  0.1 \nServices  - 0.0  - 0.0  - 0.1  0.0  - 0.0  - 0.0 \n             \nMacro GDP  0.0  0.1  0.0  0.0  0.0  - 0.0 \n  a\n Region without reduction commitment. \n   38   39 \n5  Conclusions \nIn this paper, the WorldScan energy model is extended to include emissions from the non-CO2 \ngreenhouse gases methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). These greenhouse gases are \nimportant for several reasons. Firstly, they account for 10 to 40% (depending on the region) of \nthe greenhouse gas emissions in the so-called Kyoto-basket (weighted by the Global Warming \nPotential). Furthermore, some of the non-CO2 emission sources offer reduction options at low \ncosts, suggesting that the gains from what-flexibility can be large. Moreover, the sectoral \nemission profile for methane and nitrous oxide is different from that of CO2, indicating that \nincluding non-CO2 greenhouse gases in the analyses may change the sectoral effects. The \nagricultural sector, for instance, is only a minor source of CO2, while it is an important source \nof both methane and nitrous oxide in many regions. Finally, regions differ in the availability of \nlow cost reduction options for non-CO2 gases, so that the regional effects may also vary.  \nClimate policy entails the introduction of a tax on emissions. Emissions from both CO2 and \nnon-CO2 gases can be reduced by improving either the emission efficiency or by reducing the \nlevel of the activity responsible for the emissions (e.g. for CO2 gases the production volume of \nenergy intensive goods). The modelling of emissions from non-CO2 gases differs from the \nmodelling of emissions of CO2 in the sense that the many factors contributing to the emission \nefficiency are not modelled explicitly but are collected in a \u2018catch-all\u2019 factor, the emission \nfactor. Reducing emissions by improving the emission efficiency comes at a cost of reduced \nproductivity. For CO2, this means that the mix of energy inputs is changed compared to baseline \ntowards energy inputs with lower CO2 emissions. For non-CO2 gases, this is not modelled \nexplicitly, but is instead reflected in a decline in total factor productivity. A firm thus faces a \ntrade-off between paying the emission tax and improving emission efficiency. The optimum is \ncontained implicitly in bottom-up marginal abatement cost (MAC) curves showing the emission \nvolume that can be reduced at a certain cost. However, general equilibrium effects and inter-gas \ninteractions (the so-called \u2018co-benefits\u2019) are also important. By including bottom-up MAC-\ncurves into the applied general equilibrium model WorldScan, bottom-up information is \ncombined with general equilibrium effects.  \nGeneral equilibrium marginal abatement cost curves can be derived from the model. These \ncurves give a first indication of the importance of the different effects. In Section 4.1 it is shown \nthat the importance of general equilibrium effects varies over regions. These differences can be \nexplained by referring to the relative importance of the non-CO2 gases in total emissions in that \nregion and the shape of the regional marginal abatement cost curves. For instance, for the \nformer Soviet Union, there are many low cost reduction options available. In addition, there are \nconsiderable co-benefits. By contrast, for the EU-15 countries, the contribution of non-CO2 \ngases to the full MAC-curve is only modest. The reason is that only a limited share of the non-\nCO2 emissions in the EU stem from sources with a positive reduction potential, while many of   40 \nthe inexpensive abatement options are already exhausted in the baseline. Moreover, the co-\nbenefits are only small as a result of the sectoral composition of the emissions.  \nFor all regions, non-CO2 abatement lowers total abatement costs, although the size of the \ncost reduction varies across regions. For the former Soviet Union, the share of non-CO2 gases in \ntotal reductions is high even at higher emission prices as a result of the large potential for \nreductions through induced technological change and the considerable co-benefits. The same \nholds for Eastern Europe and Latin America, though the shares of non-CO2 gases are somewhat \nsmaller in these regions. For the EU-15, the USA and the other OECD countries, on the other \nhand, the share of non-CO2 gases in the total reduction volume is modest and declines rapidly at \nhigher prices. In general, the analysis shows that there is a limited role for non-CO2 gases at \nhigher emission prices. At higher emission prices, low cost reduction options for non-CO2 gases \nare exhausted. All together, the regional effects on GDP per capita of including non-CO2 gases \nare limited. Marginal abatement costs fall, but the effect on GDP per capita is limited.  \nAt the sectoral level, there is an important shift in burden. In some regions, the share in \nvalue added of oil, coal and gas products is now higher than under a CO2-only policy. By \ncontrast, the output share of agricultural sectors is reduced relative to a CO2-only policy. \nSeveral effects play a role. Firstly, the price increase for agricultural products due to emission \ntaxes will result in a fall in demand and hence to lower production in Annex B regions. The \ndemand for these products partly shifts to non-Annex B regions, and partly to other products. \nSecondly, the output price of energy sectors does not have to increase as much as in the CO2-\nonly case, as part of the burden is now borne by non-CO2 gases.  \nNote that the sectoral effects of extending climate policy to non-CO2 greenhouse gases may \nbe underestimated in this work, as it is assumed that the reduction potential in the livestock \nsector is zero as there are no data available. In reality, the reduction potential in this sector \nmight be considerable, even though this potential may be hard to realise because of the \ndispersed nature of the emission sources. This is especially important for the analysis of the \neffects of climate policy in countries such as China and India that have a large agricultural \nsector. The gains of what-flexibility for those countries are potentially large, once the reduction \npotential in the livestock sector is taken into account.  \n \n   41 \n6  References \nBrown, S., D.

In the world and European economy the role of Renewable Energy Technologies is still increasing. Energy efficiency; sustainable agriculture; renewable energies for rural development belong to main poles of sustainable development in the world economy and its regions. Agriculture is one of the economic sectors to which the EU commitment to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases applies. Like any other economic sector, agriculture produces greenhouse gases and is a major source of the non-CO2 greenhouse gases methane and nitrous oxide. It is also the strong relationship between the sustainable agriculture sector and the renewable energy development possibilities. The sustainable agriculture can be seen as  a source of renewable energy.  1. Introduction The current financial and economic crisis should not delay cost-effective investments or programmed energy projects that would create jobs, enhance energy security and help limit greenhouse gas emissions in the short and                                                  * Ph.D., Full Professor at the University of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a 6                                                             Zofia Wysoki\u0144ska medium term. Innovation and knowledge are key factors for supporting the recovery and putting the world economy on a more sustainable growth path. It is needed to accelerate innovation in relation to long-term challenges and to encourage the development of new industries, companies and services that will be decisive to create new sources of growth. The interlinked challenges of climate change, energy security and the sustainable and efficient use of natural resources are amongst the most important issues to be tackled in the strategic perspective of ensuring global sustainability. A shift towards green growth will provide an important contribution to the economic and financial crisis recovery.  Stable and secure energy availability is indispensable for social and economic development; it is essential to ensure global energy security and energy access in developing countries. The emergency response to the economic crisis should not overlook the opportunity to facilitate a global green recovery putting our economies on a path towards more sustainable and resilient growth. Our fiscal stimulus packages are increasingly investing in measures encouraging the creation of green jobs and low-carbon, energy efficient and sustainable growth. These include energy efficiency measures, investment in public transportation infrastructure, incentives for recycling and for fuel-efficient vehicles, research in alternative sources of energy, support for renewable energy technologies, as well as in enhanced CO2 reduction.  The emergency response to the recent economic crisis should not overlook the opportunity to facilitate a global green recovery putting our economies on a path towards more sustainable and resilient growth. Our fiscal stimulus packages are increasingly investing in measures encouraging the creation of green jobs and low-carbon, energy efficient and sustainable growth. These include energy efficiency measures, investment in public transportation infrastructure, incentives for fuel-efficient vehicles, research in alternative sources of energy, support for renewable energy technologies, as well as in enhanced CO2 reduction. Energy is central to our lives. We rely on it for transport, for heating and cooling our homes, and running our factories, farms and offices. However, fossil fuel is a finite resource and is a major cause of global warming. So we can no longer take energy from fossil fuels for granted. We must create an integrated energy and environment policy based on clear targets and timetables for moving to a low-carbon economy and saving energy. Driving the policy is the EU\u2019s bid to achieve a 20% reduction in its greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 (compared with 1990 levels), mainly by boosting the use of renewable energy and curbing energy consumption. The measures will also reduce dependence on imports of gas and oil and help shelter the economy from volatile energy prices and uncertain supplies.                                                 Mutual Dependence between Sustainable...                                    7 The EU policy focuses on creating a competitive internal energy market offering quality service at low prices, on developing renewable energy sources, on reducing dependence on imported fuels, and on doing more with a lower consumption of energy.  2. Sustainable energy- strategy and policy issues The Green Paper A European Strategy for Sustainable, Competitive and Secure Energy 1was an important milestone in developing an energy policy for the European Union (EU). If Europe is to achieve its economic, social and environmental objectives, it has to address major energy-related issues such as  a growing dependence on energy imports, volatile oil and gas prices, climate change, increasing demand, and obstacles to a fully competitive internal energy market. The EU must exploit its position as the world's second largest energy market and as world leader in demand management and the promotion of renewable energy sources2. The diagnose concerning the situation in the European energy sector was based on the most important factors of the following evidence: \u2022 A need for investments to meet expected energy demand and to replace ageing infrastructure. \u2022 The European import dependency is rising. Unless we can make domestic energy more competitive, in the next 20 to 30 years around 70 % of the Union\u2019s energy requirements, compared to 50% today, will be met by imported products \u2013 some from regions threatened by insecurity.  \u2022 Reserves are concentrated in a few countries. Today, roughly half of the EU\u2019s gas consumption comes from only three countries (Russia, Norway, Algeria). On current trends, gas imports would increase to 80 % over the next 25 years. The EU currently imports 82% of its oil and 57% of its gas making it the world's leading importer of these fuels. \u2022 Global demand for energy is increasing. World energy demand \u2013 and CO2 emissions \u2013 is expected to rise by some 60% by 2030. Global                                                  1 GREEN PAPER, A European Strategy for Sustainable, Competitive and Secure Energy, Brussels, 8.3.2006; COM(2006) 105 final. 2 http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/energy/european_energy_policy/l27062_en.htm 8                                                             Zofia Wysoki\u0144ska oilconsumption has increased by 20% since 1994, and global oil demand is projected to grow by 1.6% per year3.  The European Commission oriented a European energy policy on three core objectives: \u2022 sustainability - to actively combat climate change by promoting renewable energy sources and energy efficiency; \u2022 competitiveness - to improve the efficiency of the European energy grid by creating a truly competitive internal energy market; \u2022 security of supply - to better coordinate the EU's supply of and demand for energy within an international context4. The United States and Japan have a comparative advantage in biotechnology and nanotechnology patenting and in the relevant scientific fields, while the EU is the world leader in environment-related technologies and services with special reference to recycling. Recycling: proper and effective waste management and Renewable energy-two of Leads markets of the EU. Japan is second to the EU in all three environmental technology fields5.  Since 1990, the EU has been engaged in an ambitious and successful plan to become world leader in renewable energy. To take one example, the EU has now installed wind energy capacity equivalent to 50 coal fired power stations, with costs halved in the past 15 years. The EU\u2019s renewable energy market has an annual turnover of \u20ac 15 billion (half the world market), employs some 300,000 people, and is a major exporter. Renewable energy is now starting to compete on price with fossil fuels6. In the year 2010 Commission proposed new economic strategy for Europe: Europe 20207. This Strategy presented three key drivers for growth, to be implemented through concrete actions at EU and national levels:  \u2022 smart growth (fostering knowledge, R+D, innovation, education and digital society),                                                   3 GREEN PAPER, A European Strategy for Sustainable, Competitive and Secure Energy, Brussels, 8.3.2006; COM(2006) 105 final, p.3; comp. also: Summary report on the analysis of the debate on the green paper \"A European Strategy for Sustainable, Competitive and Secure Energy\" COMMISSION STAFF WORKING DOCUMENT; Brussels, 16.11.2006 , SEC(2006) 1500 4 As above. 5 OECD SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND INDUSTRY SCOREBOARD 16 2007 \u2013 ISBN 978-92-64-03788-5 \u2013 \u00a9 OECD 2007, p.p.9-16.  6 GREEN PAPER, A European Strategy for Sustainable, Competitive and Secure Energy, op.cit. p.11. 7 COM(2010) 2020; Brussels, 3.3.2010.

On the 10th November 2010, the European Commission has adopted the Communication \"Energy 2020 - A strategy for competitive, sustainable and secure energy\" The Communication defines the energy priorities for the next ten years and sets the actions to be taken in order to tackle the challenges of saving energy, achieving a market with competitive prizes and secure supplies, boosting technological leadership, and effectively negotiate with our international partners8. The three most important objectives in the energy economy to be met in the EU by 2020, known as the \"20-20-20\" targets are as follows: \u2022 20% of EU energy consumption to come from renewable resources  \u2022 A 20% reduction in primary energy use compared with projected levels, to be achieved by improving energy efficiency  \u2022 A reduction in EU greenhouse gas emissions of at least 20% below 1990 levels9.  The EU has even offered to reduce its emissions by 30% if other major economies commit to comparable emission reductions or adequate contributions. Negotiations on this are ongoing within the framework of the United Nations. In \"A roadmap for moving to a competitive low-carbon economy in 2050\", the European Commission also looked at new ways of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80 to 95% by the middle of the century. The \"Energy 2020 Strategy\" provides also a solid and ambitious European framework for energy policy, defines the energy priorities for the next ten years and sets out the action to be taken. 1.  Free movement of energy Electricity and gas are transported in grids and pipelines that often cross national borders. The energy policy decisions made by one country inevitably have an impact on other countries.                                                   8 http://ec.europa.eu/energy/strategies/2010/2020_en.htm, see. also: Energy 2020A strategy for competitive, sustainable and secure energy, {SEC(2010) 1346}, Brussels, 10.11.2010; COM(2010) 639 final 9 The EU climate and energy package,  http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/package/index_en.htm 10                                                             Zofia Wysoki\u0144ska 2.  A technological shift  Without a technological shift, the EU will fail on its 2050 ambitions to de-carbonize the electricity and transport sectors.  3.  Strong International Partnership  International energy policy must pursue the common goals of security of supply, competitiveness and sustainability.  While relations with producing and transit countries are important, relations with large energy-consuming nations and particularly emerging and developing countries are of growing significance10.  3. Powering Development with Renewable Energy Technologies (RETs) The role of RET-s in the world economy is still increasing. According to UNCTAD, Technology and Innovation Report (2011) the total renewable power capacity (including wind-, biomass-, solar- and geo-thermal power) belong in 2/3rd to developed market economies and in 1/3rd to developing countries11. Technological progress and greater investments and deployment are lowering costs of established RET-s. Global Investments in renewable energy and related technologies during the period 2004-2010 increased from 33 to 211 $ billion. The average annual growth rate amounted to 38,3%12. The green economy and Rio+20 framework should promote wider use and learning of RETs. National Policy Frameworks for Renewable Energy Technologies (according to UN and EU regulations) are mostly oriented on:  \u2022 Defining policy strategies and goals; \u2022 Enacting policy incentives for R&D, innovation and production of RETs; \u2022 Enacting policy incentives for developing greater technology absorptive capacity, which is needed for adaptation and use of available RETs; \u2022 Promoting domestic resource mobilization for RETs in national contexts; \u2022 Exploring newer means of improving innovation capacity in RETs, including North-South and South-South collaboration.                                                   10 http://europa.eu/pol/ener/index_en.htm 11 Technology and Innovation Report (2011),Powering Development with Renewable Energy Technologies, United Nations, New York, Geneva, 2011, p. 8-9. 12 as above, p.10.                                                  Mutual Dependence between Sustainable...                                    11 4. Liberalization of markets for energy products is also one of the most important objectives of the WTO Much of today\u2019s energy supply \u2014 particularly fossil fuels and natural gas \u2014 is geographically concentrated, fixed in terms of location, and prominent in the production and trade of the countries that possess the resource. Thus, trade patterns on the supply side are largely pre-determined and change only slowly, in contrast to the shifting comparative advantage we associate with economies that are less resource-endowed in this way.  But compared to the geographical concentration that characterizes the supply side of energy markets, demand is very widely spread because we all need energy to run our economies. This relationship between supply and demand has important implications for the economic and political conditions under which trade takes place. We observe in the world economy some significant changes that are occurring in energy markets, and which some argue fortify the case for closer attention on the part of the WTO to the energy sector. Over time, a larger number of players have entered the field on the supply side. In no small part this is the result of technological advances and the diversification of energy sources. Fossil fuels and natural gas increasingly compete with alternative energy sources such as nuclear power and renewable energy, including bio-fuels, wind, water and solar power.  5. Detoxifying Finance and De-carbonization the Economy: Opportunities for Clean and Sustainable Growth in Developing and Transition Economies- main problems \u2022 A transition to a low-carbon and more resource \u2013efficient economy provides a promising avenue for economic and social development in many countries, \u2022 Promoting sustainable agriculture, enhancing energy efficiency and harnessing renewable energy for sustainable rural development are but three illustrative poles that could yield a triple win: economic growth, job and income creation, as well as environmental sustainability. \u2022 Despite the fact that such investments are strategic and can be lucrative, the greening of economies requires the elimination of perverse policy frameworks as well as the availability of public finance where public investment is deficient. 12                                                             Zofia Wysoki\u0144ska \u2022 It will also require the emergence of the necessary awareness, skills, capabilities and vision to mobilize the private sector, governments, and the society as a whole13.  \u2022 A \u201enew economic growth\u201d (within the current global and financial crisis) can only emerge if inspired leadership is manifest among a critical mass of countries. Policy measures that undermine change must be reformed or eliminated, such as subsidies (e.g.) to agriculture or energy), domestic energy policy (energy pricing), as well as national investment policies14. \u2022 Liberalization of climate \u2013friendly technologies, goods and services would contribute not only to increasing the choices available to importing countries, but also lowering the costs of those choices, thus making it easier to mitigate climate change. However, finding a viable negotiating strategy for the liberalization of these goods has proved difficult in the WTO15.  \u2022 Agriculture accounts for 13 percent of global GHG emissions. This rises to almost 30 per cent if land clearance for farming, agrochemical production and trade in agricultural and food products are attributed to the sector16. \u2022 Innovative management options, such as organic farming, offer promising opportunities to reconcile the objectives of feeding a rapidly growing human population with minimal adverse impacts on the environment17. \u2022 Methane is a significant contributor to climate change, and the bulk of methane emissions, i.e. 52%, are emitted by the agricultural sector. While methane emissions in the OECD countries as well as in the CIS have declined over the past decade, methane emission have been increasing in many developing countries and regions. With continuing growth in the demand for livestock products, methane will constitute a large proportion of future GHG emissions, particularly in developing countries18.                                                  13 Trade and Environment Review 2009/2010, United Nations, New York, Geneva,2010, p. 3. 14 As above, p. 23. 15 As above, p. 17 16 As above, p. 67 17 As above., p.112 18 As above, p. 124                                                 Mutual Dependence between Sustainable...                                    13 6. Agriculture and environmental protection Integrating environmental concerns into the Common Agricultural Policy aims to head off the risks of environmental degradation and enhancing the sustainability of agro-ecosystems. Around half the EU's land is farmed. Farming is important for the EU's natural environment. Farming and nature influence each other: \u2022 Farming has contributed over the centuries to creating and maintaining  a unique countryside. Agricultural land management has been a positive force for the development of the rich variety of landscapes and habitats, including a mosaic of woodlands, wetlands, and extensive tracts of an open countryside. \u2022 The ecological integrity and the scenic value of landscapes make rural areas attractive for the establishment of enterprises, for places to live, and for the tourist and recreation businesses. The links between the richness of the natural environment and farming practices are complex. Many valuable habitats in Europe are maintained by extensive farming, and a wide range of wild species rely on this for their survival. But inappropriate agricultural practices and land use can also have an adverse impact on natural resources, like \u2022 pollution of soil, water and air, \u2022 fragmentation of habitats and \u2022 loss of wildlife. The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has identified three priority areas for action to protect and enhance the EU's rural heritage: \u2022 Biodiversity and the preservation and development of 'natural' farming and forestry systems, and traditional agricultural landscapes; \u2022 Water management and use; \u2022 Dealing with climate change. The CAP ensures that its rules are compatible with environmental requirements and that CAP measures promote the development of agricultural practices preserving the environment and safeguarding the countryside. Farmers are encouraged to continue playing a positive role in the maintenance of the countryside and the environment. This is achieved by: \u2022 targeting aid at rural development measures promoting environmentally sustainable farming practices, like agri-environment schemes; 14                                                             Zofia Wysoki\u0144ska \u2022 enhancing compliance with environmental laws by sanctioning the non-respect for these laws by farmers through a reduction in support payments from the CAP19. EU farm policy \u2013 known as the common agricultural policy \u2013 ensures adequate European food production goes hand in hand with economically viable rural communities and action on environmental challenges such as climate change, water management, bioenergy and biodiversity20. Today, EU policy aims to enable producers of all forms of food \u2013 whether cereals, meat, dairy, fruit, vegetables or wine \u2013 to: \u2022 produce sufficient quantities of safe, high-quality food for European consumers, \u2022 make a full contribution to diversified economic development in rural areas, \u2022 meet very high standards of environmental care and animal welfare. With consumers becoming ever more quality-conscious about food, voluntary EU quality marks now help them make educated choices. These labels \u2013 indicating geographic origin, use of traditional ingredients or methods, including organic \u2013 also help make EU farm products competitive on world markets. The various reforms of EU farm policy have also promoted innovation in farming and food processing \u2013 aided by EU research projects that have increased productivity and reduced environmental impacts, e.g. by using crop by-products and waste products to produce energy21. With about 40 % of the EU\u2019s land area being farmed, agriculture has  a very important impact on the natural environment: \u2022 Over the centuries, farming has created and maintained a variety of valuable semi-natural habitats on which a wide range of wildlife depend for their survival. \u2022 Farming practices can have an adverse impact on natural resources, such as pollution of soil, water and air, fragmentation of habitats, and a loss of wildlife22.                                                   19 http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/envir/index_en.htm 20 http://europa.eu/pol/agr/index_en.htm 21 Agriculture and bioenergy, http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/bioenergy/index_en.htm 22http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/agri_environmental_indicators/ introduction                                                 Mutual Dependence between Sustainable...                                    15 7. Agriculture and Bioenergy The EU is committed to combat climate change and to increase security of its energy supply. Bioenergy from forestry and agriculture plays a key role for both. The Common Agricultural Policy helps agriculture and forestry to provide biomass for energy and encourages the use of bioenergy in rural areas23.  Basic issues related to the bioenergy \u2022 Bioenergy is one form of renewable energy among many from other sources (wind, solar, hydraulic, geothermal etc). \u2022 Bioenergy, if produced sustainably, saves greenhouse gas emissions. \u2022 Bioenergy accounts for more than two thirds of total renewable energy in the EU. \u2022 Biomass for energy is mainly provided by forestry (which provides half of the EU's renewable energy), agriculture and organic waste. The share of agriculture \u2013 although still modest \u2013 is growing fast. \u2022 Feedstocks for bioenergy are storable; bioenergy can thus be produced constantly and is a reliable source of energy. \u2022 Biomass is amply available in most parts of Europe. \u2022 Biomass can be either in solid, liquid or gaseous form and can be used to produce electricity, direct heating, or transport fuels24.                                                   23 Agriculture and bioenergy, http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/bioenergy/index_en.htm 24http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/agri_environmental_indicators/ introduction 16                                                             Zofia Wysoki\u0144ska Graph 1.

Interrelations between the EU sustainable energy and sustainable agriculture policies The two main objectives of EU energy policy are increasing security of energy supply and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Central piece of legislation is the Renewable Energy Directive 2009/28/EC. It sets ambitious binding targets for all Member States such that the EU will reach a 20% share of renewable energy by 2020. For the transport sector, it sets a specific minimum 10% target for each Member States. The Directive also establishes a comprehensive sustainability scheme for biofuels.  The Directive requires Member States to plan their development of each types of renewable energy, including bioenergy, by elaborating National Renewable Energy Action Plans. Moreover, provisions for cooperation between Member States help them to achieve their targets more cost-effectively.                                                Mutual Dependence between Sustainable...                                    17 Member States were obligated to transpose the Directive in their national legislation by December 201025. The starting point, the renewable energy potential and the energy mix of each Member State vary. It is therefore necessary to translate the Community 20 % target into individual targets for each Member State, with due regard to  a fair and adequate allocation taking account of Member States\u2019 different starting points and potentials, including the existing level of energy from renewable sources and the energy mix. It is appropriate to do this by sharing the required total increase in the use of energy from renewable sources between Member States on the basis of an equal increase in each Member State\u2019s share weighted by their GDP, modulated to reflect their starting points, and by accounting in terms of gross final consumption of energy, with account being taken of Member States\u2019 past efforts with regard to the use of energy from renewable sources26. By contrast, it is appropriate for the 10 % target for energy from renewable sources in transport to be set at the same level for each Member State in order to ensure consistency in transport fuel specifications and availability. Because transport fuels are traded easily, Member States with low endowments of the relevant resources will easily be able to obtain biofuels from elsewhere. While it would technically be possible for the Community to meet its target for the use of energy from renewable sources in transport solely from domestic production, it is both likely and desirable that the target will in fact be met through a combination of domestic production and imports. To this end, the Commission should monitor the supply of the Community market for biofuels, and should, as appropriate, propose relevant measures to achieve a balanced approach between domestic production and imports, taking into account, inter alia, the development of multilateral and bilateral trade negotiations, environmental, social and economic considerations, and the security of energy supply27. The improvement of energy efficiency is a key objective of the Community, and the aim is to achieve a 20 % improvement in energy efficiency by 2020. That aim, together with existing and future legislation including Directive 2002/91/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16                                                  25 DIRECTIVE 2009/28/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 23 April 2009 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources and amending and subsequently repealing Directives 2001/77/EC and 2003/30/EC(Text with EEA relevance), Official Journal of the European Union, L 140/16 EN Official Journal of the European Union 5.6.2009. 26 as above p.15. 27 as above p. 16. 18                                                             Zofia Wysoki\u0144ska December 2002 on the energy performance of buildings, Directive 2005/32/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2005 establishing  a framework for the setting of eco-design requirements for energy-using products, and Directive 2006/32/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2006 on energy end-use efficiency and energy services, has  a critical role to play in ensuring that the climate and energy objectives are being achieved at least cost, and can also provide new opportunities for the European Union\u2019s economy. Energy efficiency and energy saving policies are some of the most effective methods by which Member States can increase the percentage share of energy from renewable sources, and Member States will thus more easily achieve the overall national and transport targets for energy from renewable sources laid down by this Directive28. Emissions of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) from agriculture Sustainable development and the integration of environmental considerations into European Commission policy instruments have been identified as long-term targets for the EU, as expressed in the 6th Environmental Action Programme and the EU Sustainable Development Strategy29. Globally, the ultimate aim of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is to limit atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases to levels such that anthropogenic interference with the climate system is minimized, while ensuring sustainable levels of economic development can occur30. Like any other economic sector, agriculture produces greenhouse gases and is  a major source of the non-CO2 greenhouse gases methane and nitrous oxide. Both of these gases are many times more powerful greenhouse gases than CO2. The aim of this indicator is therefore to present the contribution of the agriculture sector to total emissions of EU-15 greenhouse gases. \u2022 Agriculture contributed 10.1 % of the total EU emissions of greenhouse gases in 2002 Ireland (27%), France (18%) and Denmark (15%) had                                                  28 as above. p.17.  29 VI Program Dzia\u0142a\u0144 Wsp\u00f3lnoty Europejskiej w Dziedzinie Ochrony \u015arodowiska- \u015arodowisko 2010: Nasza przysz\u0142o\u015b\u0107, Nasz wyb\u00f3r, Artyku\u0142 2, propozycja decyzji Parlamentu Europejskiego i Rady ustanawiaj\u0105cej Program Dzia\u0142a\u0144 Wsp\u00f3lnoty w Dziedzinie Ochrony \u015arodowiska na lata -2001-2010. s. 66. cyt za: Wysokinska Z., Witkowska J., Integracja Europejska.

Conclusions The main objectives in the world- and in the European Economy:-promoting poles of clean growth to foster the transition to a more sustainable economy. Sustainable development and \u201dgreen economy\u201d are the most important objectives of economic and social development for the nearest 10 years future not only in the European but also in the world economy. Europe as a leader in environment related technologies promotes sustainable growth and integrated environmental goods and services standards within the new industrial policy and strategy oriented on the cooperation with developing world.  The role of Renewable Energy Technologies in the world economy is still increasing. Energy efficiency; sustainable agriculture; renewable energies for rural development belong to main poles of sustainable development in the world economy and its regions. Agriculture is one of the economic sectors to which the EU commitment to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases applies. Like any other economic sector, agriculture produces greenhouse gases and is a major source of the non-CO2 greenhouse gases methane and nitrous oxide.                                                   31IRENA 34, Share in agriculture of gas emission, http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/agri_environmental_indicators/documents/IRENA%20IFS%2034.1%20%20Share%20of%20agriculture%20in%20GHG%20emissions_F.pdf 32 IRENA 19 - Emissions of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) from agriculture http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/agri_environmental_indicators/documents/IRENA%20IFS%2019%20-%20GHG%20emissions_FINAL.pdf; comp. also with analysis presented on p. 9 of this paper. 20                                                             Zofia Wysoki\u0144ska It is also the strong relationship between the sustainable agriculture sector and the renewable energy development possibilities. The sustainable agriculture can be seen as a source of renewable energy. Agriculture has greatly enhanced the extraction of food energy from nature. However, if agriculture is to be  a sustainable source of energy for food or fuel, we must first create a sustainable agriculture.  A sustainable agriculture, like all other sustainable development, must meet the needs of the present without diminishing opportunities for the future. It must be ecologically sound, because all agricultural productivity originates in the land \u2013 in the resources of nature. It must be socially responsible, because the fundamental purpose of agriculture is to meet the needs of people \u2013 not just consumers but also farmers and society in general. It must also be economically viable for farmers. All economic value originates in nature and society. The economy produces nothing; it simply facilitates our relationships with nature and society. So, an economically viable agriculture must be ecologically sound and socially responsible.

    "abstract": "This article investigates efficient policies against global warming in the case of multiple greenhouse gases. In a dynamic optimization model conditions for an efficient combination of greenhouse gases are derived. The model is empirically specified and adapted to a simulation approach. By various simulation runs, the economics of greenhouse gas accumulation are illuminated; and in particular, it is shown that a CO2-policy alone would most likely lead to an allocation far from efficiency.

However, there is no reason to believe that a\nCC^-policy alone will ensure efficiency in terms of overall abatement costs because there exist\nseveral other greenhouse gases that also contribute to the increase in temperature (mainly\nmethane CH4, nitrous oxide N2O, and the chlorofluorocarbons CFCn and CFC^. Hence, in\norder to sustain a desired level of mean temperature it may be less costly to refrain in part\nfrom the required CC^-reduction and to reduce the emissions of, e.g., methane by an amount\nwhich is equivalent in terms of the prevented greenhouse effect. Substitution possibilities like\nthese raise the problem how to allocate abatement activities among the different greenhouse\ngases and over time in order to ensure efficiency. The theoretical properties of this mini-\nmization problem are explored in Michaelis (1992).\n1 In the present paper, I will shed some\nlight on the empirical relevance of these findings. In particular, I will show that a 'piecemeal'\napproach that is limited to CO2 will most likely lead to an allocation far from efficiency.\nIn Section 1, the theoretical model is introduced and conditions for an efficient solution are\nderived. In Section 2, the model is adapted to an simulation approach by specifying cost func-\ntions and input data. In Sections 3 through 5, various simulation results for differing time hori-\nzon and cost data are reported. In Section 6, some empirical illustrations are provided; and in\nSection 7, the paper is completed by some policy conclusions.\n1. The Theoretical Model\nThe starting point of our analysis is a generalized version of a model originally developed in\nMichaelis (1992): Assume there exist n greenhouse gases Gj (i = l,2,...,n), let ej(t) denote the\nbasic emission levels which would occur in period t without abatement activities and let v;(t)\ndenote the amount of pollutants prevented by abatement activities. The basic emission levels\ne\"i(t) are assumed to grow with an exogenous rate gj, i.e. ei(t) = (l + gi)\ntei(0). Hence, the\namount of G; actually emitted in period t, ej(t), is given by:\neL(t) = (l+g1)te1(O) - vt(t). (1)\nThe emitted greenhouse gases accumulate in the atmosphere, with S;(t) indicating the stock of\nGj in the end of period t. Accumulated stocks, in turn, are partly degraded by natural proces-\n1 In particular, it is shown how the efficient time path depends on the ecological characteris-\ntics of the gases (greenhouse potential, atmospheric lifetime) and on the planner's attitude\ntowards mtertemporal decison making (type and length of time horizon, discount rate).ses. For simplification it is assumed that these processes can be described by constant disinte-\ngration rates q (0 < q; < 1) indicating that the degradation of the stock s;(t) during the course\nof one period is qjS;(t). Hence, the change in stock between two periods t and t +1 can be cha-\nracterized by the difference equation:\n- st(t) = e^t+1) - q^Ct). (2)\nIn order to facilitate aggregation, the stocks S;(t) are converted into CO2-equivalents by\nweighting them with their specific greenhouse warming potentials, oq.\n2 Then, from (1) and (2),\nthe following relationship between the initial stocks, the previous emissions and the current\ntotal stock of greenhouse gases, measured in terms of CO2-equivalents, s(t), can be derived:\nn t n\ns(t) =\u00bb 2 OiCL-qJts^O) +2 X a^l-q^t-Tf (l+g^Tg^OJ-v^T ) ] . (3)\ni=l T=1 i=l\nEq. (3) serves to define the ecological constraint of the model. Metereological evidence sug-\ngests that the rise in global mean temperature is directly related to the growth in stock s(t).\n3\nMoreover, it has been estimated that the ecosystem's capability to cope with global warming is\nrestricted to a maximum rise in mean temperature of approximatively 1\u00b0 to 2\u00b0 C above pre-\nindustrial levels (c.f., e.g., Swart/Hootsmans, 1991). Hence, it might be reasonable to assume\nthat s(t) is not allowed to exceed an exogenously given limit of s\u00b0 units that corresponds to the\nmaximum permissible increase in temperature. As shown in Michaelis (1992), this approach\nleads to a cost Tninimiring time path of abatement activities along which the stock of green-\nhouse gases grows according to a modified Hotelling-rule.\nHowever, the ecosystem's adaptive capability depends not only on the absolute increase in tem-\nperature, but also on the rate of change. One alternative to include this additional constraint\nwould be to define a second restriction s(t +1) < (1 + n-)s(t), where fx>0 indicates the maxi-\nmum permissible rate of growth in s(t). A second alternative, that will be adopted in the pre-\nsent paper, is to fix a (politically determined) target path s(t) = s*(t) that is assumed to satisfy\nThe greenhouse warming potentials employed above indicate the amount of CO2 that is\nequivalent to one unit of G. in terms of its instantaneous greenhouse impact. In contrast to\nthis, some of the warming potentials used in the literature are calculated in such a way that\nthey already include the disintegration rate. However, for the present analysis it is more ap-\npropriate to separate these two effects by using instantaneous greenhouse warming poten-\ntials hi combination with an explicit consideration of the disintegration process.\nNote that for a given volume of the atmosphere there is a constant relationship between\nthe stock of greenhouse gases and their atmospheric concentrations.both constraints.\n4 Inserting s(t) = s*(t) into (3) and rearranging terms yields the following con-\ndition that has to be satisfied by the abatement levels Vj(t) in order to sustain the target path:\nt n\nX S Q5t(l-qi)t-'vi(T) = a(t). (4)\nT=1 i=l\nHere, a(t) contains all information on initial stocks, basic emissions and ecological constraints:\nn t n\na(t):= S a^l-q^ts^O) +1 2 a1(l-qi)t-T(i+g1)T\u00a71(0) - s*(t). (5) i=l T=1 i=l\nBefore proceeding to complete the model it should be emphasized that the existence of dif-\nferences in disintegration rates is of particular importance for the dynamics of the problem at\nhand. Suppose, for example, basic emissions in t = l have to be reduced by an amount of z>0\nunits of CO2-equivalents in order to sustain s*(l). This reduction can be accomplished by a\nmultitude of different abatement levels {v^l), v2(l) vn(l)} that lead to different combina-\ntions of gases emitted to the atmosphere.\n5 Under the unrealistic condition of equal disintegra-\ntion rates, the mix of gases emitted in t = 1 would not influence the decisions to be made in\nsubsequent periods, and the planning problem could be solved by myopic cost minimization in\neach single period (see Michaelis, 1991). However, in reality disintegration rates are different\nand the mix of gases chosen in t = 1 affects all subsequent periods: The more gases with com-\nparatively low disintegration rates are emitted in t = 1, the more abatement activities are c.p.\nnecessary in t = 2,3,...,T in order to sustain the desired time path s*(t). Hence, solely the exist-\nence of differences hi disintegration rates necessitates the employment of an intertemporal\ncost minimization procedure.\nTo complete the model it is finally assumed that the set of feasible abatement activities can be\ncharacterized by n abatement cost functions Cj[Vj(t)].\n6 In order to obtain the efficient combina-\ntion of abatement activities among greenhouse gases and over time, the present value of the\naggregated abatement costs has to be minimized subject to the constraint (4). Minimising the\ncorresponding Langrangean:\n4 From a purely theoretical point of view the former approach might be superior because it\nimplies more intertemporal flexibility. However, from an policy-oriented point of view the\nalternative adopted in this paper seems to be more realistic.\n5 Each combination of abatement levels that satisfies the condition a1v1(t)+a2v2(t) +\n... + otnvn(t) = z yields a reduction in emissions of z units of CO2-equivalents .\n6 The cost functions are assumed to possess the usual properties: c.'[v.(t)]=0 for v.(t)=O,\nci'[\nvi(t)] > 0 for v.(t) > 0 and c.\"[v.(t)] > 0 for V;(t) >0.

Based on this observation the following relationship\nbetween marginal abatement cost can be derived from (7):\ni-qj -,T-(t+D r qj-qi i T r i-qj -,T- -aric-.(t) = | \u2014 I Z aL-ic\\(T)\\ | .

This equation clearly reveals the importance\nof differing disintegration rates as discussed above: Under the unrealistic assumption of equal\nrates q4 = q: the RHS of (8) reduces to zero, i.e. efficiency requires to equalize marginal abate-\nment cost per unit of CO2-equivalent across gases in each single period. Under more realistic\nassumptions, however, the existence of differences in disintegration rates drives a wedge bet-\nween marginal abatement costs that is indicated by the RHS of (8). For q,< qj this wedge im-\nplies osj^c'^t) >aj\"Vj(t), i.e. lower disintegration rates demand for higher marginal abatement\ncost per unit of CC^-equivalent. Moreover, as can be seen from the RHS of (8), this difference\nbetween marginal costs is c.p. the larger, the larger the difference in disintegration rates is, the\nsmaller the discount rate is, and the longer the remaining time-horizon is.\n2. A Simulation Approach\nConditions (5) and (7) provide a system of m = nxT independent equations which determines\nthe cost minimizing time path of abatement levels Vj(t) that is consistent with the contraint\ns(t) = s*(t). In order to facilitate a numerical computation of this solution, quadratic cost func-\ntions Cj[Vj(t)] = a^t)\n2 with aj > 0 are defined. Differentiating c;[Vj(t)] with respect to Vj(t) andinserting into (7) yields together with (5) a linear system of equations that can be written as\nAx = b, where x and b are m-dimensional column vectors, and A indicates the coefficient ma-\ntrix of order mxm (see Appendix). Using appropriate input data, this system can be solved\nthrough matrix inversion.\nTable 1 shows the input data employed in the simulation runs. The first row indicates the\ninstantaneous greenhouse warming potentials a; of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4),\nnitrous oxide (N2O) and the chlorofJuorocarbons CFC^ and CFC12 as published by the Inter-\ngovernmental Panel on Climate Change (cf. IPCC, 1990). At present, these five gases together\ncontribute approximately 90% to the human-made greenhouse effect. Tropospheric ozone\n(O3), which also contributes significantly to global warming, is not considered here because it\ntakes a special position: O3 is not directly emitted from anthropogenic sources but is created\nby highly complex and non-linear atmospheric processes that involve nitrogen oxides, meth-\nane, carbon monoxide and other trace gases. Hence, there exists no straigthforward way to in-\nclude O3 into the simulation model.\nco2\nCH4\nN2O\nCFCU\nCFC12\n0=1)\n(i=2)\n(i=3)\n(i=4)\n(i=5)\nai\n1\n58\n206\n3970\n5750\nqi\n0.0083\n0.0952\n0.0066\n0.0165\n0.0077\nSj(O)\n10\n6\n4860\n8 75\n0.8\n1.4\ne;(0)\n13300\n520\n8\n0.05\n0.05\n\u00a7i\n0.011\n0.002\n0.006\n-0.020\n-0.020\nai\nJ\n150\n60000\n-\n-\nTable 1: Input data to be used in the simulation runs (source: IPCC, 1990, own calculations).\nDirect estimates of the disintegration rates q; are not available, but as shown elsewhere (cf.\nMichaelis, 1992) the magnitude of qj can easily be derived from the gases' atmospheric lifeti-\nmes that are also published by the IPCC (1990). The resulting rates are given in the second\nrow of Table 1. It should be noted, however, that the atmospheric lifetime used to calculate\nthe disintegration rate of CO2, 120 years, is not unambiguous because this timespan also in-\ncludes periods in which the gas does not contribute to global warming because it is temporary\nconverted into biomass. Consequently, it would also be reasonable to employ a higher dis-\nintegration rate in calculating the efficient time path. The likely effect of an adjustment to a\nhigher disintegration rate will be in Section 5.Concerning the initial stocks s;(0) and the basic emissions levels e;(0) it is important to realize\nthat the cost minimizing solution only depends on the relative magnitudes of these figures.\nTherefore, the initial stock of carbon dioxide, s1(0), has been normalized to an (arbitrarily\nchosen) amount of 10\n6 units. Based on this benchmark the initial stocks of the remaining gases\nhave been adjusted in such a way that the resulting composition of the total initial stock s(0)\nreflects the actual atmospheric concentrations in the late eigthies (see IPCC, 1990).\nSimilarily, the initial basic emission levels, e;(0), have been adjusted in such a way that for each\ngas the growth in stock, that would result under a status quo regime (i.e. without abatement\nactivities), corresponds to the respective growth in atmospheric concentration that actually has\nbeen estimated by the IPCC (1990). The growth in basic emission levels, indicated by gj, has\nbeen calculated according to the long-term 'business as usual'-scenario of the IPCC (1990).\n7\nIn the case of CFCn and CFC^, however, another approach has been chosen in order to\nincorporate the likely impact of the Montreal Protocol. Here it is assumed that compulsory\nplans concerning the reduction of CFCs have already come into force, and the resulting\ndecrease in emissions is modelled by negative growth rates g$ and g$. This approach implies\nthat the emissions of CFCn and CFC12 affect the ecological constraint, but they are not\nsubject to the cost minimization procedure.\nThe likely magnitude of the growth rates g^ and g5 is highly uncertain because the number of\ncountries that ultimately will ratify the protocol and the extent to which the parties actually\nwill comply with the protocol is unknown yet. Different scenarios published by the Ojfice of\nTechnology Assessment (OTA, 1989) indicate that the average annual growth in global\nconsumption of CFC1:1 and CFC12 may range from -2.6% in the most optimistic case to\n+ 3.9% under worst-case assumptions. In the present paper a rather optimistic view of the\nprospects of Montreal is adopted, and it is assumed that the emissions of CFC11 and CFC12\nare reduced by 2% per year.\n8\nEmpirical estimates of abatement costs are only available for CO2 and CFCs (see, e.g.,\nNordhaus, 1991) but not for CH4 and N2O. For the FRG and comparable countries of the\nnorthern hemisphere, there is ample evidence to believe that the abatement of one ton of N2O\nis much more costly than the abatement of one ton of CH4 which, in turn, is much more costly\nthan the abatement of one ton of CO2 (see Section 6). However, a precise quantification of\n7 This scenario predicts for the period of 1990 to 2100 a total increase in emissions of about\n260%, 90% and 28% for CO2, CH4 and N2O, respectively.\n8 This assumption, however, neglects substantial time lags that may exist between reductions\nin consumption and reductions in emissions (see Hammit, 1987).these costs is far beyond the scope of the present paper. Therefore, more heuristic approach is\nadopted: In the first step, for pure illustrative purposes more or less arbitrarily chosen cost\nparameters aj are employed in order to demonstrate the dynamics of the simulation model\n(see Table I).\n9 In the second step, numerous simulation runs with varying cost parameters are\ncalculated in order to assess for which range of parameters a piecemeal approach leads to an\nacceptable approximation of the efficient solution. And finally, it is discussed whether or not\nreal abatement costs are likely to be in the range identified above.\nCO\n1\nr\ne\ne\nn\nh\no\nu\ns\nC3\nS\nt\no\nc\nk\n \no\no\nt\na\nl\ne\nn\nt\ns\n;\n \ns\n(\n0\n)\n=\n1\nZ3 cr\nUJ\nCSI\no\no\n1 2O -\n115\"-\n100 -\no 5\n'Business as Usual' Path^/\n^^\u2014~\u2014 ~~ Target Path\n1O 16 2O 25\nTime (years)\nFigure 1: Stock of greenhouse gases: 'Business as usual'-path versus target path.\nIn addition to the data presented in Table 1 a suitable target path s*(t) has to be defined. As\nemphasized by Swart(1992), a policy that is intended to be sustainable in the long run has to\naim at stabilizing the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases (see Swart 1992, p.39).\nTherefore, s*(t) is defined in terms of a growth rate jx(t) that diminishes over time: s*(t) =\n[1 + |x(t)]s*(t-l) with s*(0) = s(0) and |i(t) = 0.9\n1\"V- In order to facilitate a smooth adaption to\n9 Note that a1 can be normalized to ax = 1 because the optimal solution of the model de-\npends only on the ratio between the cost parameters, but not on their absolute magnitude.the target path the initial growth rate |x\u00b0 equals the initial 'business as usual' growth in s(t) that\namounts to about 0.6%. Figure 1 shows the resulting target path for a time-span of 25 years\ntogether with the 'business as usual'-path that would occur without any reduction measures\nconcerning CO2, CH4 and N2O. As can be seen, under 'business as usual'-conditions the stock\nof greenhouse gases grows with an almost constant rate, whereas the target path implies a\nstabilization at a level of about 6% above the initial stock.\n3. Simulation Results in the Case of a Finite Time Horizon\nFigure 2: Percentage reduction of greenhouse gases: Piecemeal approach versus compre-\nhensive approach in the case of a finite time horizon.\nFigure 2 shows the percentage reduction in emissions of CO2, CH4 and N2O - i.e. the ratio\nbetween Vj(t) and e\"j(t) - that is necessary to sustain s*(t) at minimum cost provided a discount\nrate of 5% and a finite time horizon of 25 years. Additionally, the dashed line 'CO2 alone' in-\ndicates the percentage reduction of CO2 that would be required under a piecemeal ap-proach.\n1\n0 This percentage considerably increases over time because in the latter case reduc-\ntions in CO2 emissions have to compensate for increasing basic emission levels of all green-\nhouse gases (except CFCs).\nGiven the cost parameters specified in Table 1, efficiency requires significant reductions in the\nemissions of CH4 and N2O, whereas only minor reductions hi CO2 emissions are necessary\n(see Figure 2). As a consequence, there is a remarkable gap between the percentage abate-\nment in CO2 emissions under a comprehensive approach at the one hand and a piecemeal ap-\nproach at the other hand. This gap indicates that hi the case at hand a piecemeal approach\nwould result hi an allocation far from efficiency.\n1\n1\nOf course, the particular shape of the time path depicted hi Figure 2 crucially depends on the\nassumption of a finite time horizon. In particular, the influence of differing disintegration rates\ndiminishes over time and becomes the smaller the closer one comes to the end of the horizon\n(see Section 1). However, the notion of a finite time horizon which is held fixed even when the\nfinal period is approached might be unrealistic from a political point of view. But the alterna-\ntive idea of a decision maker who plans over an infinite number of time periods also seems to\nbe naive due to several reasons like, e.g., planning costs and uncertainty about the distant fu-\nture. A possible way out of this dilemma may be to assume a time horizon that is finite but\n'sufficiently long\n5 concerning the issue of global warming, According to Cline (1991) this\nwould require a tune horizon of at least 250 to 300 years. However, from the political economy\nof public decision malting there is ample evidence to believe that the political process is not\nable to cope with the demand for such a long time horizon (e.g. Downs, 1957). A sensible way\nto overcome this dilemma is offered by the idea of sequential overlapping planning (see Faber/\nProops, 1990; Schmutzler, 1991) that will be introduced in the next Section.\n4. Simulation Results in the Case of Sequential Planning\nThe notion of sequential overlapping planning describes an intertemporal decision process\nwhere plans are set up for a finite time horizon of T periods and after a certain number of\nperiods, S (S<T), plans are reevaluated with the time horizon being T periods as before.\nContinuous repetition of this procedure leads to an (at least hi principle) infinite number of\n1\n0 As can easily be calculated from (4) the percentage abatement of CO- emissions under a\npiecemeal approach is given by v^t) = a(t)-(l-q )a(t-l).\n1\n1 In fact, for the cost parameters employed above it can be calculated that the present value\nof aggregated abatement costs is about nine times as high hi the piecemeal case compared\nto the cost minimizing comprehensive solution (see Section 5).10\noverlapping T-period plans, and the resulting sequence of the first S periods of each plan con-\nstitutes the time path that is actually realized. This approach represents a more realistic de-\nscription of political decision making than the notion of a single (finite or infinite) time\nhorizon because it reconciles short-term planning with long-term considerations.\nIn order to explore the impact of sequential planning, it is assumed that plans are reevaluated\neach year and the decision maker's time horizon covers always 12 years ahead (i.e. S = 1 and\nT = 12). Before analysing the resulting time path, it is instructive to compare the abatement\nlevels predicted by the first 12-year plan with the outcome of the 25-year plan described in the\nlast Section. As indicated by Figure 3, reducing the time horizon from 25 to 12 years leads to\nhigher percentage reductions in CH4 emissions that are accompanied by smaller reductions in\nN2O and CO2 emissions. This shift in abatement activities occurs because a trunctation of the\ntime horizon reduces the economic valuation of the natural disintegration processes, i.e. it be-\ncomes c.p. more attractive to reduce the emissions of the comparatively short-lived green-\nhouse gas CH4.\n4O 1\nO\nCO\nCO\no\nCO\nTO\no\nCD\n3O\n2O -\n1O\no -\n15\nFigure 3: Percentage reduction of greenhouse gases: Effects of reducing the time horizon.11\nFigure 4 shows the time path resulting from the first 25 plan evaluations together with the\nfinite horizon-path derived in the last Section. These curves reveal that the development of\npercentage reduction rates becomes more even and regular when the decision maker employs\nsequential planning instead of a finite time horizon. This alteration is caused by the dynamic\nproperties of sequential planning: Because the actually employed time horizon always covers\nthe same time-span ahead (12 years in the present example), the economic valuation of dif-\nferences in disintegration rates does not change over time and therefore the efficient time path\nevens out.\n6O\nFinite Time Horizon\nSequential Planning\no\nCO\nCO\no\no\nen\nCO\nL\nO\n<x>\nCL.\n4O\n2O f\n25\nFigure 4: Percentage reduction of greenhouse gases: Sequential planning versus finite time\nhorizon.\nMoreover, an interesting change in the allocation of abatement effort among gases can be\nobserved: During the first half of the time-scale considered in Figure 4, the number of years\ncovered ahead by sequential planning - always 12 years - is larger than the number of years\nstill covered ahead by the finite horizon-plan . Hence, under sequential planning it is more\nattractive to reduce the emissions of the comparatively short-lived greenhouse gas CH4. And12\nconsequently, the mix of greenhouse gases emitted to the atmosphere contains less CH4 and\nmore of the other (long-lived) greenhouse gases. However, in the medium term this accumula-\ntion of larger amounts of long-lived greenhouse gases forces the economy to intensify abate-\nment effort in order to compensate for slower natural disintegration processes. At the same\ntime, the number of years covered ahead by sequential planning begins to exceed the number\nof years still covered ahead by the finite horizon-plan. As a consequence, for the last decade\nconsidered in Figur 4, the percentage reductions in emissions of N2O and CO2 obtained under\nsequential planning considerably exceed the respective figures predicted by the finite horizon-\nplan, whereas an opposite effect occurs with respect to CH4.\nHowever, apart from the differences discussed above, Figure 4 also shows that the main con-\nclusion derived in Section 3 under the assumption of a single finite time horizon still remains\nvalid in the more realistic case of sequential planning: After all, there still exists a considerable\ngap between the percentage abatement in CO2 emissions under a piecemeal approach on the\none hand and a comprehensive approach on the other hand. Hence, for the cost parameters\nassumed above, a policy that is limited to the reduction of CO2 emissions is doomed to end up\nin an allocation far from efficiency. As will be shown in the next Section, this conclusion holds\nnot only for the particular figures employed above, but for a wide range of cost parameters.\n5. Sensitivity Analysis\nIn the last Sections it turned out that the cost data employed in the simulation runs are too\nsmall to permit efficiency under a piecemeal approach. Hence, in order to assess for which\nrange of cost data a piecemeal approach leads to an acceptable approximation of the efficient\nsolution, the parameters a2 and a3 have to be increased gradually.\n1\n2 The effects of such an in-\ncrease are clear in principle: With increasing costs of reducmg CH4 and N2O it becomes more\nattractive to reduce CO2 emissions, and the differences between a piecemeal approach at the\none hand and a comprehensive approach at the other hand diminish. Hence, with increasing\ncosts of reducing CH4 and N2O the (relative) inefficiency of a piecemeal approach decreases.\nIn order to obtain a quantitative indicator of this effect, the following ratio between aggrega-\nted abatement costs under both policy regimes is defined:\nT T 3\nR:= [ X (l+r)i-ta1v1-(t)2]/[ \u00a3 X (l+r)i-t aivt*(t)2] , (9) t=l t=l i-1\n1\n2 Note that a1 can be held fix at a^, = 1 because the optimal solution depends only on the ratio\nbetween the cost parameters but not on their absolute magnitude.Bibliofhek\n4m Instihjts fur Weltwirfcchoft\n13\nwhere v^t) and Vj*(t) denote the amount of greenhouse gas emissions to be prevented under\na piecemeal regime and under a comprehensive regime, respectively. For example, R = 2 im-\nplies that the present value of aggregated abatement costs is twice as high in the piecemeal\ncase compared to the cost minimizing comprehensive solution.\na2\na3\n60.000\n100,000\n200,000\n400,000\n1,000,000\n2,000,000\n150\n9.87\n8.83\n9.21\n8. 79\n8. 73\n8.34\n8.49\n8.24\n8.35\n8.18\n. 8.30\n8.16\n300\n6.31\n5.25\n5.62\n4.96\n5.13\n4. 76\n4.89\n4.65\n4. 75\n4.59\n4. 70\n4.57\n600\n4.55\n3.46\n3.83\n3.19\n3.32\n2.97\n3.09\n2.87\n2.95\n2. 76\n2.90\n2. 73\n1,200\n3.69\n2.40\n2.94\n2.31\n2.42\n2.09\n2.18\n1.97\n2.04\n1.92\n1.99\n1.89\n2,500\n3.24\n2.14\n2.46\n1.85\n1.94\n1.63\n1.69\n1.52\n1.55\n1.46\n1.51\n1.44\n5,000\n2.98\n1.93\n2.23\n1.64\n1.71\n1.43\n1.47\n1.31\n1.33\n1.25\n1.28\n1.23\nTable 2: Effects of varying abatement costs on the relative efficiency of a piecemeal approach\n(source: own calculations).\nTable 2 shows the magnitude of R for a variety of cost parameters a2 and a3, where the upper\nfigures refer to the reference case of a finite time horizon of 25 years, and the lower figures\nrefer to the case of sequential planning with a moving time horizon of 12 years. As can be seen\nfrom this table, even for cost parameters that appear - at least at first glance - to be consider-\nably high, the model predicts enormous losses in efficiency due to a policy that is limited solely\nto the reduction of CO2 emissions. Hence, even under favourable conditions, i.e. high abate-\nment cost concerning non-CO2 gases, the piecemeal approach might be no adequate policy\nresponse to global warming. This, of course, is only a very preliminary conclusion that has to\nbe re-examined in the light of empirical information on abatement cost (see Section 6).\nHowever, before turning to a discussion of empirical abatement cost, two qualifications should\nbe noted. Firstly, as mentioned in Section 2, due to ambiguities concerning the proper quanti-\nfication of the atmospheric lifetime of CO2, it would also be reasonable to employ a higher dis-14\nintegration rate q^. Such an increase in qls however, implies that it becomes c.p. less attractive\nto reduce the emissions of CO2 and the gap between the two different policy increases. This,\nin turn, implies an increase in the ratio R, i.e. it becomes even more unlikely that the piece-\nmeal approach leads to an acceptable approximation of the efficent solution.\nSecondly, the degree of (relative) ineffeciency of the piecemeal approach crucially depends on\nthe reference case determining the efficient solution. The outcome of the reference case, hi\nturn, depends not only on the cost parameters but also on the discount rate and the time hori-\nzon employed by the decision maker. The effect of varying these figures is clear in principle:\nLowering the discount rate or prolonging the time horizon increases the economic valuation of\ndifferences in disintegration rates, thereby discouraging measures aiming at reducing CH4 and\nencouraging abatement activities related to CO2 and N2O. Hence, the gap between the per-\ncentage reductions in CO2 under the different policy approachs, constituting the inefficieny of\na piecemeal regime, is c.p. the smaller the smaller is the discount rate and the longer is the\ntune horizon. However, assuming a longer time horizon than employed above seems to be un-\nplausible due to the political economy discussed in Section 3. Moreover, in several simulations\nruns with non-negative discount rates below the magnitude of 5% that has been employed so\nfar, it turned out that the impact of variations in r is almost insignificant. Hence, it can be\nsupposed that for the relevant ranges of r and T the mam conclusions derived above remain\nvalid irrespective of the concrete magnitudes of r and T actually chosen by the decision maker.\n6. Empirical Illustration\nAlthough the simulation results summarized in Table 2 provide a first clue to the question in\nwhich case a piecemeal approach leads to an acceptable approximation of the efficient solu-\ntion, the final answer depends on the definition of the term 'acceptable'. As an (arbitrarily\nchosen) illustrative example it may be assumed that the additional costs implied by the piece-\nmeal approach should not exceed, say, 30% of the efficient costs (i.e. R < 1.3). In this case, the\nmodel predicts that the cost parameters should at least amount to a2 = 5,000 and a3 = 400,000\nin order to justify a piecemeal approach (see Table 2). In the following it will be discussed\nwhether or not real abatement cost are likely to meet this requirement.\nThe analysis, however, will be restricted to emission sources and abatement options that are\ntypical for the developed countries of the northern hemisphere. As point of reference, a situa-\ntion where all gases under consideration (i.e. CO2, CH4 and N2O) are intended to be reduced\nby the same percentage amount of 20% compared to then- basic emission levels is chosen.\nEmpirical evidence provided by various studies on carbon taxation (for an overview see Bar-15\nret, 1990) suggests that a tax rate of abaout S 150 per ton of carbon would be needed to\nachieve a 20% reduction in CO2 emissions. For a conversion rate of about 3.7 tons of CO2 per\nton of carbon this implies marginal abatement cost of about $ 40 per ton of CO2. In the fol-\nlowing, this figure will be used as benchmark. In doing so, it is assumed that the real cost\nstructures actually can be described by quadratic cost functions of the type employed above.\n1\n3\nGiven the assumption of quadratic cost functions, the ratio of marginal abatement cost bet-\nween two gases Gj and G: equals the ratio of cost parameters weighted by the ratio of abate-\nment levels: MCj(v;)/MCj(v:) = [aj/a:]-[Vj/Vj]. Rearranging terms and taking into account that aj\nhas been normalized to ax = l yields: ai = [MCi(vi)v1]/[MC1(v1)vi]. Hence, in order to satisfy aj > aj, marginal cost per ton of CH4 or N2O, respectively, should at least amount to marginal\ncost per ton of CO2 weigthed by ajVj/vj:\nMCt(Vi) > \u2014\nL-MC1(v1) (i=2,3). (10)\nAccording to Table 1, an uniform percentage reduction in all gases under consideration\nimplies a ratio of abatement levels of v^Vj = 1/25 between CH4 and CO2 and v^Vj = 1/1700\nbetween N2O and CO2. Inserting these figures into (10) and accounting for MCj = $ 40,\na2 = 5,000 and a3 = 400,000 results in to MC^S 8,000 and MC3>$ 9,400. In other words:\nGiven the assumptions specified above, the model predicts that a piecemeal approach limited\nto CO2 can only be justified in terms of efficiency if the marginal abatement cost for a 20%\nreduction amount to at least $ 8,000 per ton of CH4 and $ 9,400 per ton of N2O. As will be\nshown below, there is strong empirical evidence which suggest that these requirements are not\nmet in reality.\nMethane\nIn- the industrialized countries of the northern hemisphere, the anthropogenic emissions of\nGH4 can be traced back almost completely to three types of sources: livestock (ruminants),\nwaste disposal at landfills; and leakages from fossil fuel cycles (coal mining, distribution of\nnatural gas). For example, in the FRG, annual emissions of CH4 amount to about 3 million\ntons, of which 31%, 27% and 38% are attributable to livestock, landfills and fossil fuel cycles,\nrespectively (see Bundesregierung, 1992a).\n1\n4\n1\n3 As suggested by Nordhaus (1992, p.50), this assumption may be not too far from reality at\nleast in the case of carbon dioxide.\n1\n4 These percentages can not be applied to other countries because they are heavily biased\ntowards fuel cycles due to the bad condition of the energy systems in the former GDR.16\nConcerning efficient policies to reduce CH4 emissions, it seems quite reasonable to suppose\nthat any least-cost strategy would first of all aim at reducing agricultural emissions because all\nother options (i.e. overhauling leaky gas distribution systems; installing gas insulation equip-\nment at landfills and coal mines) would involve extremely high capital costs. At present, the\nonly practicable way to reduce agricultural emissions of CH4 is a reduction in livestock itself\nbecause the CH4-production per unit of livestock can hardly be influenced by measures like\nchanges in feeding, and moreover, there exist no low-cost technologies to prevent the rumi-\nnants' digestive gases from escaping to the atmosphere (see Sauerbeck/Brunnert, 1990).\nAmong all ruminants, milk cows possess by far the highest 'emissions coefficient' - about 0.1\ntons of CH4 per year and unit of cattle. Therefore, the following discussion concentrates on\nthe option of reducing CH4 emissions via reducing the number of milk cows. Hence, in order\nto guess whether the cost condition a2 > a2 is met, it has to be asked whether the social value\nof the last ten milk cows, that have to be slaughtered in order to achieve the desired level of\nCH4 reduction, is likely to amount to at least $ 8,000.\nIn a perfectly competitive environment the social costs of slaughtering a milk cow equal the in-\ndividual fanner's loss in income corrected for the induced price effects on producers' and\nconsumers' surplus. However, in the FRG, as well as in most other countries, the market for\nmilk is not competitive but highly regulated by quotas and price floors inducing an enormous\nexcess supply. Hence, it may be assumed that there exists considerable scope for reducing the\nnumber of milk cows without significantly increasing milk prices, so that total social costs can\nbe approximated by the farmers' loss in income. In the FRG, for example, the fanners' aver-\nage net income from milk production at present amounts to about $ 600 per cow and year (see\nBundesregierung, 1992b). This figure, however, includes a huge amount of indirect subsidies\ncaused by the regulations mentioned above, so that the true social costs of reducing livestock\nmay be well below the figure of $ 600 per cow and year. Hence, as long as reducing livestock is\npossible without significantly increasing prices, it is quite reasonable to conclude that marginal\nsocial costs per ton of CH4 (i.e. the equivalent of 10 cows) are not likely to add up to $ 8,000.\nNitrous Oxide\nAs pointed out by the German Enquete Commission on Protecting the Earth's Atmosphere (cf.\nEnquete, 1990), the use of industrial and, to a smaller extent, organic nitrogen fertilizer has to\nbe regarded as the main source of human-made N2O in the countries of the northern hemis-\nphere. Empirical evidence suggests that an average of about 2-3% of the utilized nitrogen is\nconverted into N2O and emitted to the atmosphere (cf. Sauerbeck/Brunnert 1990). Account-\ning for the relative molecular mass of nitrogen and oxygen this leads to an average emission\ncoefficient of about 0.04 tons of N2O per ton of nitrogen. Hence, reducing the emissions of17\nN20 by one ton requires an average reduction in agricultural input of nitrogen in the order of\nmagnitude of about 25 tons.\nAssuming that prices remain unchanged, the social costs of reducing the agricultural input of\nnitrogen can be approximated by the farmers' loss in income corrected for direct and indirect\nsubsidies. For example, in the FRG the annual input of nitrogen at present amounts to about\n1,500,000 tons at a price of $ 650 per ton (see Statistisches Bundesamt, 1991). Under the as-\nsumptions that farmers behave rational (i.e. price of nitrogen = value of marginal product)\nand that nitrogen demand is given by a linear demand curve with an elasticity of -0.5 at current\nprices (cf. Andr6asson, 1989) it can be calculated that marginal loss in income at a 20% reduc-\ntion level amounts to $ 260 per ton of nitrogen.\n1\n5 Accounting for the emission coefficient\nderived above this implies a marginal loss in income of about $ 6,500 per ton of N2O. Since\nthis figure, furthermore, is not corrected for subsidies, and since it is based on the heroic\nassumption of rational behaviour, it seems obvious that marginal social costs per ton of N2O\nare well below the benchmark of $ 9,400.\n7. Policy Conclusions\nAlthough the model presented above describes the respective economy-environment interac-\ntions within a considerably simplified framework, and although the empirical results derived\nfrom the model are highly speculative, the basic policy implication is obvious: A piecemeal ap-\nproach that is limited to CO2 alone is most likely to lead to an allocation far from efficiency.\nAs the model illustrates, excessive abatement costs imposed on society by ignoring potential\nsubstitution possibilities between the different greenhouse gases may amount to 30% or more\ncompared to the efficient solution. These results strongly suggest that policy measures against\nglobal warming should tackle not only carbon dioxide but also methane and nitrous oxides. A\nreasonable way to pursue an efficient allocation of abatement activities among greenhouse\ngases would be the implementation of a comprehensive charge system on greenhouse gases.\n1\n6\nThe most striking implication of such an approach may be that it would not only affect the use\nof fossile fuels but it would also impose a considerable burden on modern agriculture special-\nising hi livestock and in intensive farming techniques because these activities contribute\nsignificantly the atmospheric accumulation of methane and nitrous oxide.\n1\n5 This can easily be calculated using the geometrical properties of linear demand functions.\nFor an example, see Andr6asson (1989).\n1\n6 The theoretical and practical properties of such a charge system on greenhouse gases are\ndiscussed in Michaelis (1992).18\nAppendix\nAs shown in Section 2, from an empirical point of view the problem at hand boils down to the\ncost minimizing allocation of abatement activities among n = 3 greenhouse gases, viz. CO2,\nCH4 and N2O. In this case, the column vectors x and b are given by x' = [v1(l) Vj(2) v1(3) ...\nVi(T) v2(l) ... v?(T) v3(l) ... v3(T)] and b' = [0 0 ... 0 0 CT(1) a(2) cr(3) ... a(T)].

    "title": "Mitigating Greenhouse Gases in Agriculture",
    "abstract": "Climate change has severe adverse effects on the livelihood of millions of the world\u2019s poorest people. Increasing temperatures, water scarcity and droughts, flooding and storms affect food security. Thus, mitigation actions are needed to pave the way for a sustainable future for all. Currently, agriculture directly contributes about 10-15 percent to global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Adding emissions from deforestation and land use change for animal feed production, this rises to about 30 percent. Scenarios predict a significant rise in agricultural emissions without effective mitigation actions. Given all the efforts undertaken in other sectors, agriculture would then become the single largest emitter within some decades, and without mitigation in agriculture, ambitious goals, such as keeping global warming below two degrees may become impossible to reach. The main agricultural emission sources are nitrous oxide from soils and methane from enteric fermentation in ruminants. In addition, conversion of native vegetation and grasslands to arable agriculture releases large amounts of CO2 from the vegetation and from soil organic matter. The main mitigation potential lies in soil carbon sequestration and preserving the existing soil carbon in arable soils. Nitrous oxide emissions can be reduced by reduced nitrogen application, but much still remains unclear about the effect different fertilizer types and management practices have on these emissions. Methane emissions from ruminants can only be reduced significantly by a reduction in animal numbers. Sequestration, finally, can be enhanced by conservative management practices, crop rotation with legumes (grass-clover) leys and application of organic fertilizers. An additional issue of importance are storage losses of food in developing and food wastage in developed countries (each about 30-40 percent of end products). Thus, there are basically five broad categories of mitigation actions in agriculture and its broader context: zz reducing direct and indirect emissions from agriculture; zz increasing carbon sequestration in agricultural soils; zz changing human dietary patterns towards more climate friendly food consumption, in particular less animal products; zz reducing storage losses and food wastage; zz the option of bioenergy needs to be mentioned, but depending on the type of bioenergy several negative side-effects may occur, including effects on food security, biodiversity and net GHG emissions. Although there are many difficulties in the details of mitigation actions in agriculture, a paradigm of climate friendly agriculture based on five principles can be derived from the knowledge about agricultural emissions and carbon sequestration: zz Climate friendly agriculture has to account for tradeoffs and choose system boundaries adequately; zz it has to account for synergies and adopt a systemic approach; zz aspects besides mitigation such as adaptation and food security are of crucial importance; zz it has to account for uncertainties and knowledge gaps, and zz the context beyond the agricultural sector has to be taken into account, in particular food consumption and waste patterns. Regarding policies to implement such a climate friendly agriculture, not much is yet around. In climate policy, agriculture only plays a minor role and negotiations proceed only very slowly on this topic. In agricultural policy climate change mitigation currently plays an insignificant role. In both contexts, some changes towards combined approaches can be expected over the next decade. Its 13 is essential that climate policy adequately captures the special characteristics of the agricultural sector. Policies with outcomes that endanger other aspects of agriculture such as food security or ecology have to be avoided. Agriculture delivers much more than options for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and serving as a CO2 sink. We close this report with recommendations for the five most important goals to be realized in the context of mitigation and agriculture and proposals for concrete actions. First, soil organic carbon levels have to be preserved and, if possible, increased. Governments should include soil carbon sequestration in their mitigation and adaptation strategies and the climate funds should take a strong position on supporting such practices. Second, the implementation of closed nutrient cycles and optimal use of biomass has to be supported. Again, governments and funds should act on this. Policy instruments for nitrate regulation are a good starting point for this. As a third and most effective goal, we propose changes in food consumption and waste patterns. Without a switch to attitudes characterized by sufficiency, there is a danger that all attempts for mitigation remain futile. Finally, there are two goals for research, namely to develop improved knowledge on nitrous oxide dynamics, and on methods for assessment of multi-functional farming systems. Without this, adequate policy instruments for climate friendly agriculture and an optimal further development of it are not possible",

\nmore than one billion people go to bed hungry every \nnight. Climate change is threatening the livelihoods of \nmany around the world. The ACT Alliance therefore wel-\ncomes this study by ACT members on mitigating green-\nhouse gases in agriculture. Working to relieve hunger \nand ensure that people can live in peace and with dignity \nis at the heart of ACT\u2019s development and humanitarian \nwork. \nSince the beginning of the ACT Alliance, climate change \nhas been a subject of great importance as it is having \nhighly damaging effects on the global south. Some of \nour members are already experiencing the effects of \nclimate change. Changing rainfall patterns, more floods \nand droughts, and storms that are becoming more vio-\nlent, are all becoming more frequent. A predicted rise in \nglobal temperature will have even more serious impacts, \nthe full extent of which we do not yet know. \nFor people who are already struggling to survive and \nwho are dependent on agriculture for their daily needs, \nclimate change is a huge threat. They will have to adapt \ntheir  food  production  and  agriculture  techniques,  all \nwhile trying to ensure they have enough food to keep \ntheir  families  alive.  As  an  alliance  of  more  than  110 \nchurches and church-related organisations working to-\ngether in over 140 countries around the world, we are \nproud that our members are sharing their knowledge \nand expertise to pursue our goal of a more just world. \n \nJohn Nduna \nGeneral Secretary \nACT Alliance 11\nPreface\nFood is a basic need and a human right. However, to-\nday\u2019s world is more distant than ever from being free \nfrom hunger. While abundant food is available, almost \none billion people are suffering from hunger. Prevailing \nhunger in a world of plenty is a clear result of lacking \npolitical will, as it has been stated by the UN Secretary \nGeneral\u2019s Task Force on Hunger. Moreover, hunger is a \nsevere breach of States\u2019 human rights obligations in in-\nternational law, i.e. the International Covenant on Eco-\nnomic, Social, and Cultural Human Rights (ICESCR), which \nhas been ratified by the vast majority of States.\nWhile  today\u2019s  world  is  being  characterized  as  a  world \nof plenty which deprives one out of six human beings \nfrom the right to be free from hunger and malnutri-\ntion, global warming bears the enormous risk to deepen \nthe current food crisis and to eventually lead to a future \nworld where our children suffer from global food scar-\ncity.  Changing  and  less  predictable  weather  patterns, \nmore extreme weather events such like droughts and \nfloods as well as coastal erosion and sea level rise are \nworsening the framework conditions of food produc-\ntion already today. This hits poor people in particular. Be-\nsides adaptation measures in agriculture, the mitigation \nof greenhouse gases is a precondition to keep global \nwarming below 2\u00b0C. Once again, agriculture comes into \nthe picture. Around 10 to 15 percent of all greenhouse \ngas emissions can be accounted to agriculture, not even \nincluding emissions of deforestation where agriculture \nagain is the single most important driver.\nThis report was commissioned from the Research Insti-\ntute of Organic Agriculture (FiBL) to shed light on the \nmitigation potential of agriculture. The conclusions cre-\nate some hope. There is a great potential to significantly \nreduce emissions from agriculture \u2013 and it seems to be \na potential which has only been started to be explored. \nHowever, the report also points to the fact that the in-\ncrease in food production and the global shift to a more \nmeat and protein based \u201cwesternized\u201d diet will become \na ticking bomb of boosting emissions if no corrective \naction is being taken.\nThe authors of the study argue that the two most im-\nportant strategies that need to be taken within the ag-\nricultural production system are to increase soil carbon \nand to close the nutrient cycles in agriculture. Besides \ntheir  mitigation  potential,  both  strategies  have  other \nadvantages, too, such as increased soil fertility and water \nholding capacity and hence an important contribution \nto adaptation, increased productivity and food security. \nPolitical framework conditions are key factors to either \nfoster or hinder necessary changes towards a more cli-\nmate friendly agriculture. This is true for both indus-\ntrialized  and  developing  states.  This  report  analyses \n(agricultural) policies at both national and international \nlevels, taking the lessons from three case studies, the \nEuropean Union, Brazil, and Indonesia. In none of these \ncases, the mitigation potential in agriculture has been \nsystematically mobilized. In contrary, current agricultur-\nal policies in all three countries include incentives for an \nemission intensive agriculture. Based on their findings, \nthe authors give policy recommendations for necessary \npolicy changes.\nBut we need not wait for farmers or policy makers to \nmove  \u2013  consumers  can  act  now:  massive  changes  in \nconsumption  patterns  towards  a  more  regional,  sea-\nsonal, environmentally sound and more vegetarian diet \nwith less wastage will decrease emissions from agricul-\nture, whereas continuing in the same way will lead to an \nincrease in emissions. Civil society in general and faith \nbased organizations in particular have an important role \nto play. Let\u2019s get it started.\n \nBeat Dietschy \nBread for All\nCornelia F\u00fcllkrug-Weitzel \nBrot f\u00fcr die Welt\nErik Lys\u00e9n \nChurch of Sweden\nHenrik Stubkj\u00e6r \nDanChurchAid12\nExecutive summary\nClimate change has severe adverse effects on the liveli-\nhood of millions of the world\u2019s poorest people. Increas-\ning temperatures, water scarcity and droughts, flooding \nand storms affect food security. Thus, mitigation actions \nare needed to pave the way for a sustainable future for \nall.\nCurrently, agriculture directly contributes about 10-15 \npercent to global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Add-\ning emissions from deforestation and land use change \nfor animal feed production, this rises to about 30 per-\ncent. Scenarios predict a significant rise in agricultural \nemissions  without  effective  mitigation  actions.  Given \nall the efforts undertaken in other sectors, agriculture \nwould  then  become  the  single  largest  emitter  within \nsome  decades,  and  without  mitigation  in  agriculture, \nambitious goals, such as keeping global warming below \ntwo degrees may become impossible to reach. \nThe main agricultural emission sources are nitrous ox-\nide from soils and methane from enteric fermentation \nin ruminants. In addition, conversion of native vegeta-\ntion and grasslands to arable agriculture releases large \namounts of CO2 from the vegetation and from soil or-\nganic matter. The main mitigation potential lies in soil \ncarbon sequestration and preserving the existing soil \ncarbon in arable soils. Nitrous oxide emissions can be \nreduced  by  reduced  nitrogen  application,  but  much \nstill remains unclear about the effect different fertilizer \ntypes and management practices have on these emis-\nsions. Methane emissions from ruminants can only be \nreduced significantly by a reduction in animal numbers. \nSequestration, finally, can be enhanced by conservative \nmanagement  practices,  crop  rotation  with  legumes \n(grass-clover)  leys  and  application  of  organic  fertiliz-\ners. \nAn  additional  issue  of  importance  are  storage  losses \nof food in developing and food wastage in developed \ncountries (each about 30-40 percent of end products). \nThus, there are basically five broad categories of mitiga-\ntion actions in agriculture and its broader context: \nreducing direct and indirect emissions from agricul-   z\nture; \nincreasing carbon sequestration in agricultural soils;   z\nchanging human dietary patterns towards more cli-   z\nmate  friendly  food  consumption,  in  particular  less \nanimal products;\nreducing storage losses and food wastage;   z\nthe option of bioenergy needs to be mentioned, but    z\ndepending on the type of bioenergy several negative \nside-effects may occur, including effects on food se-\ncurity, biodiversity and net GHG emissions. \nAlthough  there  are  many  difficulties  in  the  details  of \nmitigation actions in agriculture, a paradigm of climate \nfriendly agriculture based on five principles can be de-\nrived from the knowledge about agricultural emissions \nand carbon sequestration:\nClimate friendly agriculture has to account for trade-   z\noffs and choose system boundaries adequately; \nit has to account for synergies and adopt a systemic    z\napproach; \naspects  besides  mitigation  such  as  adaptation  and    z\nfood security are of crucial importance; \nit  has  to  account  for  uncertainties  and  knowledge    z\ngaps, and \nthe context beyond the agricultural sector has to be    z\ntaken into account, in particular food consumption \nand waste patterns. \nRegarding policies to implement such a climate friendly \nagriculture, not much is yet around. In climate policy, \nagriculture only plays a minor role and negotiations pro-\nceed only very slowly on this topic. In agricultural policy \nclimate change mitigation currently plays an insignificant \nrole. In both contexts, some changes towards combined \napproaches can be expected over the next decade. It 13\nis essential that climate policy adequately captures the \nspecial  characteristics  of  the  agricultural  sector.  Poli-\ncies with outcomes that endanger other aspects of ag-\nriculture such as food security or ecology have to be \navoided. Agriculture delivers much more than options \nfor mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and serving as \na CO2 sink. \nWe close this report with recommendations for the five \nmost important goals to be realized in the context of \nmitigation and agriculture and proposals for concrete \nactions. First, soil organic carbon levels have to be pre-\nserved and, if possible, increased. Governments should \ninclude soil carbon sequestration in their mitigation and \nadaptation strategies and the climate funds should take \na strong position on supporting such practices. Second, \nthe implementation of closed nutrient cycles and opti-\nmal use of biomass has to be supported. Again, govern-\nments and funds should act on this. Policy instruments \nfor nitrate regulation are a good starting point for this. \nAs a third and most effective goal, we propose changes \nin  food  consumption  and  waste  patterns.  Without  a \nswitch to attitudes characterized by sufficiency, there \nis a danger that all attempts for mitigation remain fu-\ntile. Finally, there are two goals for research, namely to \ndevelop improved knowledge on nitrous oxide dynam-\nics, and on methods for assessment of multi-functional \nfarming systems. Without this, adequate policy instru-\nments for climate friendly agriculture and an optimal \nfurther development of it are not possible.14\n1  Introduction \nClimate change will adversely affect hundreds of mil-\nlions of people and will pose serious threats to the glo-\nbal food system and to rural livelihoods. To assure food \nsecurity, adaptation to climate change is unavoidable. \nIn addition, as much climate change mitigation as pos-\nsible needs to be undertaken for reducing this pressure. \nWhile  clearly  acknowledging  the  fundamental  impor-\ntance of successful adaptation to climate change in ag-\nriculture, the focus of this report is on mitigation in ag-\nriculture. Adaptation is thus mentioned repeatedly, but \nit is not in the focus of the following analysis. \nAgriculture contributes significantly to global GHG emis-\nsions and thus to anthropogenic climate change. But \nagriculture has also a huge potential to contribute to cli-\nmate change mitigation. Moreover, agriculture is strong-\nly affected by climate change. The direct contribution of \nagriculture to total global greenhouse gas emissions is \nabout 10-15 percent. Counting indirect emissions from \nland use change (viz. deforestation and cultivation of \npeatlands) and input production as well, this share rises \nto more than 30 percent (Smith et al. 2007, 2008; Bel-\nlarby et al. 2008). \nCurrently, national and international climate policy and \ndiscussions  of  their  future  development  focuses  on \nmitigation  in  the  energy,  industry  and  transportation \nsectors, and also in reducing deforestation. The mitiga-\ntion potential of agriculture, however, has yet received \nlittle attention in these policy discussions. Climate policy \nshould harvest this mitigation potential, and, with a sim-\nilar aim, agricultural policy should put more emphasis on \nclimate change aspects. \nMitigation in agriculture has to be achieved in a sustain-\nable way. Furthermore, other outputs from agriculture \nsuch as various ecosystem services have to be duly ac-\ncounted for. Mitigation is only one among many param-\neters of sustainable agriculture. In particular, mitigation \nin agriculture must not compromise food security for a \ngrowing population. \nMany  intergovernmental  and  national  governmental \nbodies  and  NGOs  deal  with  these  aspects,  some  with \na more science-based approach while others are more \npolicy-based.  This  report  supports  the  work  towards \noptimal climate change mitigation in agriculture by as-\nsessing it in the context of agriculture as an emitter, as \na sector with considerable mitigation potential, and as a \nsector of crucial relevance for all aspects of sustainability \nincluding food security and livelihoods for many of the \npoorest people on earth. Thereby, it accounts for both \nthe science and policy aspects. \nThe report is divided into four parts. Following the in-\ntroduction,  including  the  background  and  context  of \nthis study, section 2 provides some methodological re-\nmarks. The next part includes section 3 to 6. It begins \nby providing a global picture of agricultural greenhouse \ngas emissions and their sources within the agricultural \nsector. Next, carbon sequestration in agricultural soils is \ndescribed in more detail, as this has a substantial miti-\ngation potential and has become a topic of rapidly in-\ncreasing interest. In order to further illustrate the rel-\nevance of agricultural mitigation, the report continues \nby presenting trends and future climate scenarios. All \nthis information sums up to the fact that considerable \npotential for climate change mitigation exists in the ag-\nricultural sector and that realizing this mitigation poten-\ntial is essential for reaching stringent mitigation goals \nsuch as the two-degree goal. This leads to the need for \na new paradigm for agricultural development: climate \nfriendly  agriculture.  Different  possibilities  to  actualize \nclimate friendly agriculture are then presented in the \nfollowing section. \nAll this factual information serves as a scientific basis to \nunderstand the relevance of the agricultural sector in \nclimate change mitigation policies. In section 7 and 8, \nwe describe and analyze global (UN), regional (EU) and \ncountry policies (Indonesia, Brazil) with regard to their \nsupport  for  agricultural  mitigation.  Both  climate  and \nagriculture focused policies are considered. The choice \nof the country policies was driven by the specific inter-\nest in case study based assessments of climate policy of \nan important rice producer (Indonesia) and of a meat, \nfodder and biomass producer (Brazil). This part thus as-15\nsesses both climate and agricultural policies at different \nlevels.\nThe  report  concludes  in  section  9  by  providing  con-\ncrete policy recommendations, aimed at harvesting the \npotential of the agricultural sector to mitigate climate \nchange in a sustainable way. \nWe  want  to  acknowledge  the  very  valuable  input  of \nBread for all, \u201dBrot f\u00fcr die Welt\u201d, Dan Church Aid, Church \nof Sweden, APRODEV, Urs Niggli and J\u00f8rgen Olesen who \nreviewed the whole or parts of the report.16\n2  Methodological Remarks\nThe information in section 3 to 6 of the report is based \non a literature review drawing on scientific databases \nand the expert knowledge of the authors. (Inter-)gov-\nernmental  (e.g.  UNFCCC,  FAOSTAT,  EU  Commission), \nsome NGO and academic sources were considered. \nFor the assessments and comparisons of greenhouse \ngas emissions and soil carbon sequestration, those are \nusually expressed in CO2 equivalents (CO2-eq). We also \nadopt this approach in this report. Each greenhouse gas \ncontributes to a larger or smaller extent to the green-\nhouse effect. In order to be able to compare the effects \nof different greenhouse gases, they are all converted \nto the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) that would cre-\nate as high a greenhouse effect as the gas in question. \nConsidering (as usually done) a 100 year global warming \ntime horizon, methane (CH4) has a global warming po-\ntential of 25, and nitrous oxide (N2O) of almost 300.\nWhen analysing emissions and sequestration, it is im-\nportant to point out that the respective data is always \nafflicted with uncertainties and faces data gaps. Thus, \nfigures must be regarded with care (Mayo and Sessa \n2010; Steenblik and M\u00f6is\u00e9 2010). Reasons for this in-\nclude that:\nMethods to determine emissions rely on many es-   z\ntimated and uncertain values, such as average crop \nharvests,  irrigation  levels  and  livestock  numbers \n(Baumert et al. 2005).\nLocal  conditions  play  a  strong  role  in  agriculture.    z\nLocal ecosystems, soil parameters, available labour \nand  commonly  used  production  techniques  vary \nstrongly  from  place  to  place.  This  is  of  particular \nimportance for nitrous oxide emissions, and less so \nfor methane; cf. e.g. the assessment given in Muller \nand Aubert (forthcoming).\nMany  important  processes  behind  agricultural    z\nemissions  are  not  yet  fully  understood,  e.g.  the \nsoil processes behind nitrous oxide emissions and \ntheir interaction with soil carbon sequestration. In \nconsequence,  many  potential  mitigation  options \nin agriculture are neither fully understood nor fully \ndeveloped. \nAs a consequence, compiling data on greenhouse    z\ngas emissions from the agricultural sector is a chal-\nlenging  task,  especially  for  developing  countries \n(Mayo and Sessa 2010).\nDifferent sources use different categorizations for    z\nagricultural  and  other  emissions,  and  accounting \nof emissions can be done in different ways. The life \ncycle  assessment  approach,  for  instance,  tries  to \ncapture all emissions that are related to the produc-\ntion, trade, consumption and disposal of a specific \nproduct expressed as a functional unit (for example \nfor 1 kg milk). This approach is also used for calculat-\ning the so-called \u201ccarbon footprints\u201d of agricultural \nproducts (Steenblik and M\u00f6is\u00e9 2010). An approach \nfocusing on single farming practices, on the other \nhand, may be based on data covering on-farm emis-\nsions only and not indirect emissions from inputs. \nThus, system boundaries need to be taken into ac-\ncount when assessing and comparing different ag-\nricultural emission data.\nThe different sectors overlap and interact, compli-   z\ncating the picture even more. For instance, energy \nproduction  by  the  agricultural  sector  (\u201cbiofuels\u201d) \nproduces  interactions  with  the  transport  sector: \nDue to biofuels, emissions from the transport sector \nare reduced, while at the same time emissions from \nland use change and agriculture are increased.\nA literature review was also the basis for section 7 and \n8, and the relevant literature was gathered in the same \nmanner as for the previous part. Given the topic, the \nemphasis  was  naturally  stronger  on  (inter-)govern-\nmental  documents.  Besides  scientific  policy  assess-\nments, nonscientific sources (NGO reports and policy \nbriefs) were considered as well. In fact, scientific peer-\nreviewed publications assessing policies with regard to \nagricultural mitigation were rather scarce. This is due \nto the nature of the topic. The fast dynamics of the 17\npolicies, their ever changing contents and form and \nthe debates surrounding them necessitate a strong in-\nvolvement of civil society and governmental agencies, \nwhile  scientific  analysis  is  adequate  for  certain  spe-\ncific aspects of this process only. Besides the sources \nmentioned, one climate policy and agriculture expert \nwas interviewed and some authors were contacted by \nemail and commented on specific aspects. \nBased  on  these  sources,  on  the  factual  background \nprovided in the report\u2019s first part and on their individual \nexpertise, the authors draw conclusions in the section \n9, which correspondingly also depend on the authors\u2019 \nindividual  judgements.  These  conclusions  comprise \nrecommendations on how to improve, change or im-\nplement new policies in order to exploit agriculture\u2019s \npotential to contribute to the global challenge of cli-\nmate change mitigation. In drawing these conclusions \ndue account is paid to not compromise food security, \npoverty alleviation or various ecosystem services and \nclimate change adaptation. It is crucial to emphasize \nthat mitigation in agriculture is only feasible if it sup-\nports  the  important  contributions  of  agriculture  re-\ngarding other aspects of sustainable development.\nThroughout the report, we use the term \u201cagricultural \nsector\u201d when referring to the narrow IPCC categoriza-\ntion: According to that, the agricultural sector corre-\nsponds to the so-called \u201cSource/Sink Category 4\u201d and \ncomprises emissions from six broad subsectors (IPCC \n1996): \nemissions from enteric fermentation in ruminants;   z\nemissions from livestock manure management;   z\nmethane emissions from flooded rice fields;    z\nemissions from fertilized agricultural soils;    z\nemissions from field burning of biomass waste and   z\nemissions from burning of savannas (for pest, weed    z\nand  vegetation  growth  control  and  nutrient  cy-\ncling). \nNot covered under this definition of the agricultural \nsector  are  1)  Sewage  emissions  (covered  under  the \nwaste sector); 2) CO2 emissions and sequestration due \nto land conversion, e.g. deforestation to gain/expand \nagricultural land are counted under the land use, land \nuse change and forestry sector \u2013 LULUCF \u2013 which is the \nnumber one cause of deforestation; 3) Emissions from \nagrochemical  productions,  which  are  covered  under \nthe  industrial  sector;  4)  Emissions  related  to  energy \nconsumption  \u2013  e.g.  machinery,  irrigation,  buildings, \netc. \u2013 which are covered under the energy sector.\nWhen we refer to \u201cagriculture\u201d we mean all agricultural \nemissions as just described, including both the emis-\nsions of the IPCC`s \u201cagricultural sector\u201d, which we call \n\u201cdirect emissions (from agriculture)\u201d and the above-\nmentioned  additional  four  emissions  sources,  which \nwe subsume under \u201cindirect emissions (from agricul-\nture)\u201d.18\n3  Greenhouse gas emissions \nfrom agriculture\nThis section discusses global greenhouse gas emissions \nfrom  agriculture,  using  the  common  metric  of  CO2-\nequivalents (cf. section 2). We present the share of ag-\nricultural emissions to total emissions and then further \ndifferentiate in three complementary ways, namely by \ngases (nitrous oxide, methane, carbon dioxide), sub-sec-\ntors (e.g. rice production, livestock), and regions (e.g. \ndeveloped versus developing world, EU). More details on \nthe EU and details on Brazil and Indonesia are given in \nsection 8, where this region and the two countries are \npresented as case studies. Emission trends over time are \npresented in section 5. \n3.1  Share of agricultural to total \nemissions\nAccording to the narrow UN definition of the agricul-\ntural sector, it causes 10 \u2013 15 percent of global anthro-\npogenic GHG emissions (Baumert et al. 2005; Smith et \nal. 2007; Bellarby et al. 2008; EC 2010a) . Including the \nindirect sources, this percentage increases to more than \n30 percent (Bellarby et al. 2008). This makes agriculture \nthe second largest emitter after fossil energy use (US-\nEPA 2006a). Agriculture is also the largest produ  cer of \nboth methane and nitrous oxide, which together make \nup about 22 percent of global emissions (Baumert et al. \n2005).\n3.2  Emissions by regions\nOn a regional level, the shares of the different green-\nhouse gases in the total and the contributions of various \nsectors to it are different than on the global level. In the \nEU-27, for instance, about 9 percent of total GHG emis-\nsions originate from the agricultural sector (Figure 1). \nThis can be explained by the fact that agriculture plays \n1  Values vary slightly between different years: most recent globally aggregated numbers are given in Smith et al. 2008, refer-\nring to model results from 2005 that base on underlying data from 2000. Recent numbers for 2009 are available for industrial \ncountries from their natio  nal inventories.\na less prominent role (if measured in GDP shares) in Eu-\nrope than globally. Again, this figure must be considered \na low estimate, as indirect emissions are accounted for \nunder other sectors (Schulze 2010). In Brazil, for exam-\nple, shares are much higher, with direct emissions from \nthe  agricultural  sector  at  more  than  20  percent  and \nemissions from LULUCF at about 60 percent (cf. section \n8.3).\nFigure  2  shows  the  total  and  per  capita  agricultural \nemissions by country for the 25 most emitting coun-\ntries worldwide. Together, they are responsible for 72 \npercent of all agricultural emissions worldwide (Baumert \net al. 2005). There is a clear distinction between total \nemissions \u2013 e.g. 1.1 Gt CO2-eq /yr in China \u2013 and per \ncapita emissions \u2013 e.g. less than 1 tCO2-eq per capita and \nyear in China.\n3.3  Emission sources by agricultural \nsub-sectors and by gases\nAgricultural practices are each associated with certain \nemissions.  Typical  direct  emissions  are  methane  and \nnitrous oxide. In addition, CO2 is directly released as a \nresult of agricultural activities. Counted as direct agricul-\ntural emissions under the IPCC categorization are only \nCO2 emissions from microbial decay or burning of plant \nlitter  and  soil  organic  matter,  and  not  the  emissions \nfrom fossil fuel use in machinery and input production \n(IPCC 2006). Indirect emissions occur also in the form of \nmethane, nitrous oxide and CO2. \nThe most important source of nitrous oxide emissions \nare fertilized soils. A certain part of the nitrogen ap-\nplied to soils via organic and mineral nitrogen fertilizers \nor green manure and other forms of plant residues is \nemitted as nitrous oxide, which is generated through \nsoil microbial processes. These nitrous oxide emissions \naccount for more than 40 percent of the sector\u2019s overall \nemissions (cf. Figure 3). Nitrous oxide emissions are par-19\nFigure 1:  Share of the GHG emissions of the agricultural sector in total EU-27 emissions in 2007 (CO2-eq)\nBased on EEA databases (on the basis of EU Member States greenhouse gas inventories and projections) (EC 2009a)\nFigure 2:  CO2-eq emissions from agriculture, total and per capita, 2000: Top 25 GHG emitters\nSources and notes: WRI, based on CAIT and IEA 2004a.

Not only do many factors play a \nrole, but also knowledge on how exactly they influence \nemissions is incomplete (Bouwman et al. 2002). \nA robust finding is that reduced nitrogen inputs result in \nreduced nitrous oxide emissions. This effect is particu-\nlarly strong for shifts from very high to medium nitro-\ngen fertilization levels (Bouwman et al. 2002). However, \nfigures of nitrous oxide emissions must always be re-\ngarded with special care. \nMethane is produced mostly by enteric fermentation in \nruminants and in rice production. About a third of all ag-\nricultural emissions are from the enteric fermentation in \nruminants. Most of the world`s rice is produced as wet-\nland rice in so called rice paddies under flooded condi-\ntions, which leads to methane emissions from anaerobic \nprocesses. Other sources of methane are manure man-\nagement and biomass burning.\nThe animal sector is a good illustration on how differ-\nent  approaches  for  allocating  emissions  to  different \nsectors  can  influence  an  assessment.  In  its  2006  re-\nport \u201clivestock`s long shadow\u201d, the FAO used a life cycle \nanalysis, accounting for all direct and indirect emissions \nalong the livestock value chain (Steinfeld et al. 2006). \nThey found that 18 percent of all anthropogenic green-\nhouse gas emissions are caused by the livestock sector if \nassessed in such an encompassing manner. Considering \ndirect manure and livestock emissions only, the share is \nabout 5 percent.\nNot only ruminants, but livestock in general are an im-\nportant source of emissions, as feed production is often \nassociated  with  carbon  dioxide  emissions  from  large-\nscale  deforestation  and  corresponding  biomass  and \nsoil carbon losses, e.g. for soy and maize production. In \nfact, land use change is the most important source of \ncarbon emissions associated, at least indirectly, with the \nexpanding agriculture. Estimates are very uncertain, but \nit accounts for about 5.9 +/- 2.9 Gt CO2-eq/yr globally. \nThis is slightly more than total global emissions from the \nagricultural sector (Bellarby et al. 2008). Besides from \nland use change, CO2 is also released from fossil fuel use \nfor irrigation, agricultural machinery and the heating of \ngreenhouses. This corresponds to about 10 percent of \ndirect  agricultural  emissions  although  not  counted  in \nthe agricultural sector by the IPCC categorization (Bel-\nlarby et al. 2008).\nOverall global agricultural emissions, for which are count-\ning direct agricultural emissions plus input production \nand energy use, but land use change is disregarded, are \ncomposed of about 41 percent nitrous oxide, 49 per-\ncent methane and 10 percent carbon dioxide according \nto Bellarby et al. (2008) (Figure 3).\nIn  relation  to  total  global  emissions  of  each  of  these \ngases, the agricultural sector causes about 50 percent \nof methane emissions, and 60 percent of nitrous oxide \nemissions worldwide (Smith et al. 2007). With regard to \ntotal global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, \nmethane  accounts  for  about  15  percent,  and  nitrous \noxide  for  about  8  percent  of  total  emissions  (US-EPA \n2006a).\nAbout  38  percent  of  annual  direct  global  agricultural \nsector emissions are derived from fertilizer use (2.1 Gt \nCO2-eq; in relation to an average of 5.6 Gt CO2-eq; Bel-\nlarby et al. 2008), followed by enteric fermentation (32 \npercent, 1.8 Gt CO2-eq), biomass burning (12 percent, \n0.7 Gt CO2-eq), paddy rice (11 percent, 0.6 Gt CO2-eq) \nand manure handling (7 percent, 0.4 Gt CO2-eq). Ferti-\nlizer production emissions, not accounted for in direct \nagricultural emissions, are also of the order of 7 percent \nif put in relation to these direct emissions. \nEmissions from energy use are again lower with 0.37 \nGt CO2-eq for irrigation (6 percent) and 0.16 Gt CO2-\neq for farm machinery (3 percent, again put in rela-\ntion to direct emissions). For Europe, this distribution \nis slightly different. Rice cultivation does not play a role \nhere (only about 1 percent), and fertilized soil accounts \nfor almost half of the total agricultural emissions (cf. \nFigure 4).21\nFigure 3:  GHGs from agriculture counting direct agricultural emissions plus input production and \nenergy use, disregarding land use change \nAdapted from Bellarby et al. 2008\nFigure 4:  GHG emissions of the agricultural sector for EU-27\nBased on EEA databases on the basis of EU Member States greenhouse gas inventories and projections (EC 2009a)\nCH4: Enteric fermentation\n31%\nCH4: Manure management\n12%\nN2O: Manure management\n7%\nN2O: Agricultural soils \n49%\nCH4: Rice cultivation\n1%\nRest 90%\nAgricultural\nsector 10%\nSoils \n(nitrous \noxide)\n38%\nEnteric \nfermentation\n(methane)\n32%\nBiomass burning\n(methane and \nnitrous oxide)\n12%\nManure \n(methane) 7%\nFertilizer production CO2, N2O 7%\n2\nIrrigation CO2 6%\nMachinery CO2 3%\nRice (methane)\n10%\nNitrous oxide\n45%\nMethane\n55%\nA.

Thus, soil carbon se-\nquestration means increasing soil organic carbon and \nsoil inorganic carbon stocks through judicious land use \nand recommended management practices (Lal 2004). Al-\nthough soil carbon sequestration does not mean avoid-\nance  and  reduction  of  the  formation  of  greenhouse \ngases it is considered as a significant mitigation strategy \nbecause of the soils\u2019 potential to store large amounts of \nCO2 at a global scale (IPCC 2007). \nThe global soil carbon pool is about 9,200 Gt CO2-eq, \nthereof about 5,700 Gt CO2-eq are soil organic carbon \nand 3,500 Gt CO2-eq soil inorganic carbon (e.g. Lal 2004). \nThe soil carbon pool is 3.3 times bigger than the atmos-\npheric pool (2,800 Gt CO2-eq) and 4.5 times bigger than \nthe biotic pool (2,000 Gt CO2-eq) (e.g. Lal 2004). High \nsoil carbon levels have also other beneficial effects, as \nthey improve soil structure, fertility and soil life, thus \ncontributing  to  improved  plant  health,  water  holding \nand retention capacity, resistance against drought and \nextreme weather events. The main reason for high soil \ncarbon levels are high organic matter inputs, crop ro-\ntations  with  grass-clover/forage  legumes  leys  and/or \nlittle disturbance of protected soil organic matter. Par-\nticularly high soil carbon levels are found in wetlands, \nwhere anaerobic conditions prevent degradation of the \norganic matter. Conservation of high soil carbon levels \nis achieved in undisturbed, permanent systems such as \nforests, grasslands and wetlands.\nIn this section, we assess soil carbon levels and their de-\nvelopment, including losses of soil carbon. We differen-\ntiate findings about soil carbon levels and developments \naccording to regions/vegetation/soil types, crops, and \nmanagement techniques/fertilizer types. While soil car-\nFigure 5:  Changes in carbon stock from peat land to arable land and from arable land to grassland\nChanges in carbon stock from peatland to arable land (blue/light line) and from arable land to grassland (red/dark \nline). Each Eco-system and agroforestry management crop system has a soil carbon equilibrium.

It should also be mentioned \nthat besides sequestering soil carbon, the most impor-\ntant issue is probably to protect the existing stocks of \nsoil carbon, since the increase in large-scale arable agri-\nculture to produce more cereals and protein feed will in \nmany cases reduce soil organic matter levels.\nSoil carbon levels follow a saturation dynamics (cf. Fig-\nure 5). This means that undisturbed soils in temperate \nclimates are in equilibrium with relatively high carbon \nlevels. This is found for example in forests, or grasslands. \nA land use change then usually leads to a decrease in soil \ncarbon levels, e.g. in the case of deforestation for crop-\nland development. This decrease is slowed and halted at \nlow carbon levels again. \nSimilarly, soil carbon sequestration comes to a halt at \nhigh carbon levels, when equilibrium is reached again. \nThis dynamics extends over several decades, depend-\ning on the climate conditions. While conventional agri-\nculture led to huge soil carbon losses on a global level \nover the past decades (Lal 2004), with correspondingly \nadverse effect regarding soil fertility, erosion and pro-\nTable 1:  Global carbon stocks in vegetation and top one metre of soils\nBiome Area Carbon Stocks\n(Pg CO2-eq)\nCarbon stock concentration\n(Pg CO2-eq M km2\nM km2 Vegetation Soils Total\nTropical forests 17.60 776 791 1,566 89\nTemperate forests 10.40 216 366 582 56\nBoreal forests 13.70 322 1,724 2,046 149\nTropical savannas 22.50 242 966 1,208 54\nTemperate grasslands 12.50 33 1,080 1,113 89\nDeserts and semideserts 45.50 29 699 728 16\nTundra 9.50 22 443 465 49\nWetlands 3.50 55 824 878 251\nCroplands 16.00 11 468 479 30\nTotal 151.20 1,706 7,360 9,066 60\nductivity, there are management practices that can halt \nsoil carbon losses and even reverse them, thus leading \nto sequestration. Examples are use of organic fertilizers, \ncrop rotations with grass-clover leys improved residue \nmanagement and reduced tillage practices (cf. section \n6). \n4.1  Regions, vegetation and soil types\nSoil  carbon  stocks  are  distributed  unevenly.  Generally, \nintensively managed land will have lower carbon stocks \nthan  natural  vegetation  (Table  1).  Croplands  have  the \nlowest carbon stock concentration of all terrestrial eco-\nsystems, except for deserts and semi-deserts. Wetlands \nhave by far the greatest carbon stock concentration, be-\ning more than eight times that of croplands. Wetlands \ncover only a small percentage of land, but they still con-\ntribute twice as much to the global carbon stock than \ncroplands do (Table 1). \nAs a result, the conversion from a more natural type of \nland use to croplands can have a pronounced negative \neffect on carbon stocks (Figure 5). The drainage of peat-\nlands and the deforestation of woodlands prior to land \nuse change are the actions with the most detrimental \nimpact on CO2 release. With drainage of peatlands the \npreviously anoxic and methane emitting peat horizons \nSource: Bellarby et al. 200824\nbecome oxic and the aerobic decomposition of organ-\nic matter to CO2 starts subsequently and will turn the \npeatland from a previous CO2 sink to a CO2 source (e.g. \nMinkkinen et al. 1999). Thereby, CO2 emissions are that \nhigh that they offset the methane emission reductions \nfrom drainage. The lowland peatlands of south-east Asia \nrepresent an immense reservoir of fossil carbon and are \nreportedly responsible for 30 percent of the global CO2 \nemissions from Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry \n(Couwenberg et al. 2010). These authors conservatively \nestimated emissions of at least 9 t CO2-eq/ha/yr for each \n10 cm of additional drainage depth.\nWith forest clearance it is not only the soil carbon stock \nbut also the vegetation biomass, which is transformed \ninto CO2 to a large extent. In some areas, like in Brazil, \nland use change by deforestation is a significant source \nof GHG emissions (cf. section 8, about 60 percent of to-\ntal emissions from Brazil).\nGrasslands,  although  they  are  often  used  for  agricul-\nture show higher soil carbon stocks than the croplands \nbecause of their permanent vegetation cover and the \nt CO2-eq/ha/y Loss (-) or Gain (+)\nCrop Lower range Upper range\nSugar beet  -2.8  -4.8\nPotatoes  -2.8  -3.7\nMaize (silage)  -2.1  -2.9\nCereal crops, oleiferous crops  -1.0  -1.5\nGrain legumes  +0.6  +0.9\nAlfalfa grass/Clover grass  +2.2  +2.9\nStubble crops  +0.3  +0.4\nInterrow crops  +0.7  +1.0\nTable 2:  Benchmark values for crop-specific changes in soil organic carbon stocks expressed in \nCO2-equivalents (t CO2-eq/ha/y)\nNegative values show the required humus demand. Within crop rotations positive and negative changes can be par-\ntially or totally compensated (Redrawn from VDLUFA 2004; this is a study from Germany and data on other crops, in \nparticular from the South (rice, yams, etc.) is not available. As the reason behind these numbers lies in the cropping \nand tillage practices and less in species characteristics themselves, one may assume that other root-vegetables will \nhave a similar range of losses as potatoes and dry rice would be similar to wheat. No indication for wet rice can be \nderived from this data, though). \nunderlying undisturbed soil horizons. With the conver-\nsion to cropland, this carbon reservoir is turned to CO2 \ngradually because of tillage-induced disturbances initi-\nating aerobic decay of the organic matter.\n4.2  Crop selection\nCrop species and the corresponding crop specific man-\nagement  differ  widely  with  respect  to  their  effects \non soil carbon levels (cf. Table 2). Maize for example is \nplanted in late spring in Mid Europe in width larger than \n50 cm allowing significant areas of bare soil prone to \nwind and water erosion. Furthermore, maize does not \nexpress intensive rooting within its short vegetation pe-\nriod. Such management related factors and less the spe-\ncific characteristics of the crops themselves are mainly \nbehind the carbon balance of individual crops as shown \nin Table 2. \nLegumes which were part of crop rotations of Mid Eu-\nropean agriculture for centuries were replaced in recent \ndecades  by  maize  varieties  as  with  progress  in  plant \nbreeding maize cultivation was also possible in disad-25\nvantaged cropping areas with lower temperatures, less \nsunshine and poorer soil qualities, where legumes were \nstandard  fodder  crops  before.  But  this  replacement \nof the fodder crops red clover and alfalfa by maize for \nsilage  leads  to  changes  in  soil  organic  carbon  stocks, \nmainly due to the management differences. Whereas \nclover and alfalfa cultivation lead to significant soil or-\nganic  carbon  accumulation,  maize  for  silage  depletes \nthe humus stocks of up to -3 t CO2-eq/ha/yr (Table 2) \n(VDLUFA 2004). \nA cropping system of particular interest is agroforestry, \nwhich can lead to high soil carbon levels due to the for-\nestry part of the cultivation system. Agroforestry is the \nproduction of livestock or food crops on land that also \ngrows trees for timber, firewood, or other tree products. \nIt includes shelter belts and riparian zones/buffer strips \nwith woody species (Bellarby et al. 2008). The standing \nstock of carbon above ground is higher than the equiva-\nlent land use without trees, and planting trees may also \nincrease soil carbon sequestration (e.g. Nair et al. 2009). \nThe perceived potential is based on the premise that the \nefficiency of integrated systems in resource capture and \nutilization (nutrients, light, and water) is greater than in \nsingle-species systems and therefore will result in great-\ner net carbon sequestration (Nair et al. 2009). Estimates \nof the carbon sequestration potential of agroforestry \nsystems are derived by combining information on the \nabove-ground,  time-averaged  carbon  stocks  and  the \nsoil carbon levels. \nThe amount of carbon sequestered in any agroforestry \nsystem will depend on a number of site-specific biologi-\ncal, climatic, soil, and management factors. Nair et al. \n(2009) compiled data from 16 sites worldwide and found \na large variation in the above- and belowground carbon \nsequestration potential of agroforestry. The lowest se-\nquestration rates were found in a fodder bank in Mali \n(1.1 t CO2-eq. ha/yr; 7.5 years runtime) and the highest \nin mixed species stands, Puerto Rico (55.8 t CO2-eq./ha/\nyr; 4 years runtime) (Nair et al. 2009). \nThere are methodological difficulties, however, in esti-\nmating carbon stocks of biomass and the extent of soil \ncarbon storage under varying conditions. Also there is \na lack of reliable estimates of area under agroforestry. \nNair et al. (2009) estimate that the area currently under \nagroforestry worldwide is about 1 million ha.\n4.3  Management and fertilizers\nReduction  of  soil  disturbance  and  improved  residue \nmanagement has also a significant impact on soil car-\nbon sequestration (Bellarby et al. 2008). Soil disturbance \nby tillage aerates the soil enhancing microbial decom-\nposition along with the release of CO2 and the loss of \ncarbon. The traffic by machinery or livestock and the \ntillage can also lead to compactions and poor drainage. \nThese disturbances can be reduced through no-till prac-\ntices and less intensive grazing. No-till is a controversial \nsubject, though, due to its promotion by agribusiness \nin combination with GMO crops and adequate pesticides \nwith the correspondingly adverse effects on smallhold-\ners\u2019 livelihoods and independence. \nIn  addition  the  higher  GHG  emissions  from  increasing \nreliance on herbicides and machinery needed for weed \ncontrol may reduce the carbon benefits from no-till agri-\nculture (Bellarby et al. 2008). Most importantly, however, \nthe mitigation potential of no-till itself is also contested. \nA  recent  most  encompassing  review  on  the  available \nliterature on no-till agriculture concludes that this prac-\ntice does not lead to increased soil carbon sequestration \n(Gattinger et al. 2011). A crucial study hereby is Luo et \nal (2010) who analysed global data sets from 69 paired \nexperiments  and  found  a  SOC  enrichment  in  the  up-\npermost 10 cm of a soil and a depletion in the 20-40 \ncm horizon for no-till. Overall, adopting no-till did not \nenhance SOC stock down to 40cm. Luo et al. (2010) as-\nsumed the combination of diverse crop rotations aim-\ning at continuous vegetation cover with reduced tillage \npractices might be a more efficient strategy to sequester \nCarbon in agro-ecosystems making use of reduced soil \ndisturbance. This strategy is now introduced into organic \nfarming systems and first results from Switzerland show \na clear SOC benefit after 5 years (Berner et al. 2008). \nThe importance of complex crop rotations is illustrated \nby the meta-study of West and Post (2002), for exam-26\nple. They report increased soil carbon sequestration by \nabout 0.8 t CO2-eq/ha/yr in comparison to monocul-\ntures. \nDiacono and Montemuro (2010) investigated the effect \nof regular organic fertilisation on SOC levels by review-\ning long term experiments lasting between 3 and 60 \nyears.  They  found  that  long-lasting  application  of  or-\nganic amendments such as compost or crop residues \nincreased SOC levels by up to 90 percent versus unfer-\ntilized soil, and up to 100 percent versus chemical ferti-\nlizer treatments. \nDespite these general trends, that seem well established, \nuncertainties and knowledge gaps prevail. It has to be \nmentioned,  for  example,  that  there  could  be  trade-\noffs of high soil carbon contents and organic fertilizers \nwith higher nitrous oxide emissions (e.g. Bouwman et \nal. 2002), but more research on this is needed. Unex-\npected findings can always occur, as the following exam-\nple illustrates. Research on European croplands based \non the observation of five crop rotations and two mo-\nnocultures for 4 years at 7 different sites show carbon \nlosses, in average of 3.5 \u00b1 3.2 t CO2-eq/ha/yr (Kutsch et \nal. 2010). These results challenge current good practice \nguidelines, as even at sites where farmer applied organic \nmanure and increased residue incorporation a neutral \ncarbon  balance  could  not  be  achieved.  According  to \nKutsch et al. (2010) humus loss in spite of good practice \nis most pronounced in soils with high carbon concentra-\ntions, which are not in equilibrium. The authors assumed \nthat it may also be a result of an already ongoing climate \nchange as this leads to increased soil microbiological ac-\ntivity due to higher average temperatures.27\n5  Agriculture and mitigation \n\u2013 current trends and future \nscenarios \nThe previous two sections addressed current agricultur-\nal emissions and soil carbon sequestration. This section \naddresses the future development of these emissions \nand sequestration based on emission scenarios. \nWe  shortly  depict  the  current  trends  in  agricultural \nemissions  and  sequestration  and  subsequently  assess \nthe most important and widely used emission scenarios \nand how they picture future agricultural emissions and \ncarbon  sequestration.  We  add  some  methodological \nand concluding remarks.\n5.1  Current Trends\nAssessing current trends gives a first description on how \nagricultural emissions may develop. This does not take \ninto account systematically any driving forces or interac-\ntions with other sectors. Current trends suggest a dif-\nferentiation between developed and developing coun-\ntries, as in the latter agricultural production is becoming \nmore industrialized with correspondingly higher green-\nhouse gas emissions, while agriculture loses importance \nin most developed countries. \nGlobally, agricultural methane and nitrous oxide emis-\nsions have increased by nearly 17 percent from 1990 to \n2005 (Smith et al. 2007). During that period, develop-\ning countries showed a 32 percent increase, and were, \nby 2005, responsible for about three quarters of total \nagricultural  emissions.  Developed  countries  showed  a \ndecrease of 12 percent in the emissions of these gases \n(Smith et al. 2007).\nThus, current agricultural GHG emissions are rising and \nreasons for the upward trend include:\nGreater demand for food in general due to popula-   z\ntion growth, which leads in particular to higher total \nuse of nitrogen fertilizers and expansion of cropland \nareas (Smith et al. 2007).\nIncreasing  meat  demand  associated  with  changing    z\ndiets  and  consequently  more  livestock  and  animal \nfeed demand (Smith et al. 2007; Bellarby et al. 2008; \nSmith et al. 2008).\nFurther regional differentiation is necessary to under-\nstand the trends. Declining emissions in the developed \nworld resulted from averaging an increasing trend for \nNorth America and Canada, and a decreasing trend for \nmost  of  Europe  and  Russia.  In  Russia,  e.g.  emissions \nfrom the agricultural sector have decreased by 55 per-\ncent from 1990 to 2008, in the EU-27 by 20 percent. \nDuring the same time span, emissions have increased \nby 10 percent in the United States and by 29 percent in \nCanada (UNFCCC 2011a). \nIn  the  EU,  the  decline  in  nitrous  oxide  and  methane \nemissions over the last two decades was due to a de-\ncline in nitrogen input (Nitrate directive) and a reduction \nin animal numbers (cf. section 7). Australia also showed \na decline in emissions. This was mainly due to drought \nconditions over the past decade with correspondingly \nreduced number of animals. The end of this drought in \n2010 is expected to result in correspondingly increas-\ning emissions again (Australian Government 2010). This \nillustrates how the stories behind the development of \nemissions are very different for different regions.\nCurrent trends in agricultural emissions are also reflect-\ned in soil carbon losses from land use change due to \ngrowing demand for food and feed. From 1961 to 2002 \nthe global agricultural production area has increased by \n10 percent (Smith et al. 2007, based on FAOSTAT 2006). \nThis figure is composed of a 2 percent decrease of ag-\nricultural land in developed countries and a 19 percent \nincrease in developing countries during the mentioned \ntime span. This land use change and agricultural produc-\ntion resulted in huge soil carbon losses and correspond-\ning CO2 emissions. A very gross estimate of this can be \nbased on the annual loss of 0.6-2.8 GtC/yr as reported \nfor the 1980 (Houghton 2003, table 4), and the fact that \nthese  carbon  losses  increased  over  the  last  decades \n(Houghton 2003), arriving at 40 GtC for these 40 years, \nwhen assuming an average of 1GtC/y. Lal (2004) reports \nestimates of this for the last 150 years, providing a range 28\nof 44-537 GtC for this period, with a common range of \n55-78 GtC. These are very uncertain numbers and may \nserve only as an indication of order of magnitudes.\n5.2  The IPCC SRES Scenarios and \nAmendments\nThe  most  important  and  most  widely  used  climate \nchange emissions scenarios are the so-called SRES sce-\nnarios from the IPCC, which were developed in the Spe-\ncial Report on Emission Scenarios SRES published in 2000 \n(IPCC 2000). This report contains 40 scenarios covering \nthe development of emissions till 2100, grouped in four \n\u201cscenario  families\u201d  based  on  4  storylines.  These  story \nlines are differentiated along the key aspects of a glo-\nbalized vs. a regionalised world and a strong economic \ngrowth focus vs. a strong environmental focus. For a \nshort description of the storylines see e.g. the Summary \nfor Policymakers of the SRES (IPCC 2000, SPM, p.4). \nSeveral  criticisms  have  been  forwarded  against  these \nscenarios and specific aspects of the underlying model-\nling approaches (see e.g. the discussion in Girod et al. \n2009). Important for this report here is Strengers et al. \n(2004) who address the shortcomings of the SRES sce-\nnarios  with  regard  to  land  use,  land  use  change  and \nforestry (LULUCF). They mainly criticise that LULUCF is \nrepresented poorly in these scenarios and partly incon-\nsistent, due to use of models that are not built to cap-\nture LULUCF. They point out that not only population dy-\nnamics mainly drives LULUCF and agricultural emissions \n(as concluded in the assessment of most SRES scenarios, \nin combination with technological progress and dietary \npreferences), but also the temporal and spatial dynam-\nics of greenhouse gas sources and sinks, and systemic \nfeed backs and interactions in the climate system that \ninfluence deforestation and forest re-growth. They pro-\nvide improved assessments of LULUCF in the scenarios \nbased on an improved and more adequate model. \nThis criticism was taken up in the section on agriculture \nof the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report from 2007 (Smith \net al. 2007), which bases the analysis of aspects related \nto LULUCF on these improved calculations of Strengers \net  al.  (2004).  These  improved  SRES  scenarios  provide \nLULUCF emissions and sequestration for the period till \n2100.\nThere are however no numbers for the other agricul-\ntural emissions from the improved SRES scenarios. We \nthus  only  state  some  general  and  robust  findings.  A \ngeneral  pattern  is  that  population  dynamics,  techno-\nlogical  progress  and  dietary  preferences  (amount  of \nmeat consumption, i.e. size of the animal sector) have \na strong effect on agricultural emissions. Depending on \nthe relative strength of these drivers, emissions may in-\ncrease, stagnate or decrease. The storyline with strong \ngrowth, peaking population numbers, globalisation and \ntechnological progress (A1) leads to rather flat aggre-\ngate agricultural emissions, while the storyline with a \nstrong  emphasis  on  environmental  concerns  (B1)  has \na tendency for reduced emissions. The storyline with \nongoing  population  growth,  an  economic  focus  but \nno globalisation and correspondingly low technological \nprogress in developing regions (A2) leads to the highest \nemissions, and the storyline without globalisation but \nsome  emphasis  on  environmental  concerns  (B2)  also \nleads to some, but less high increases in emissions (IPCC \n2000, ch.5). These results are intuitive but incomplete, \nas pointed out above. \nIn  addition,  we  report  emission  scenarios  from  other \nsources that were also used in Smith et al. (2008) and \nIPCC (2007). These are the FAO World Agriculture: To-\nwards 2015/2030 forecasts on a global level (FAO 2003), \nresp. the US-EPA (2006a) forecasts till 2020 on a regional \nlevel. The trends identified are largely similar for both \nof these sources. Nitrous oxide emissions will increase \nby 35-60 percent by 2030, resp. by 50 percent by 2020, \nmainly due to increased synthetic fertilizer use and ma-\nnure management. \nMethane  emissions  will  increase  up  to  60  percent  by \n2030, mainly due to increased animal numbers. There, \nUS-EPA  (2006a)  has  lower  estimates  of  20  percent  by \n2020. Methane emissions from rice increase by 4.5 per-\ncent till 2030 according to FAO (2003) and by 16 per-\ncent till 2020 according to US-EPA (2006a), mainly due to \nincreased rice cropping areas. On the whole, emissions \nare expected to increase about 10-15 percent per dec-29\nade, and aggregated emissions from agriculture would \nthus contribute 8.3 GtCO2-eq/yr to total greenhouse gas \nemissions in 2030. Compared to a mid-value for total \nglobal emissions in the SRES scenarios in 2030, which \nalso  largely  show  increasing  emissions  by  then,  this \nwould be about 15 percent.\nAs with the above mentioned current trends of emis-\nsions,  it  makes  sense  to  differentiate  between  devel-\noped and developing countries and by different world \nregions, as the projections for 2005 till 2020 from US-\nEPA (2006a) look very different for these different coun-\ntries and regions (cf. Figure 6). \nThe  two  assessments  discussed  above  are  based  on \nmore  simplistic  modelling  approaches  than  the  SRES \nscenarios. The FAO (2003) model, as described in their \nappendix,  uses  exogenous  values  for  population  and \nGDP  growth  and  heavily  relies  on  expert  judgements \nfor more detailed regional and crop specific aspects and \nconditions. As they state in Appendix 2, p 380, \n\u201cThe end product may be described as a set \nof projections that meet conditions of ac-\ncounting consistency and to a large extent \nrespect constraints and views expressed by \nthe specialists in the different disciplines and \ncountries.\u201d \nFigure 6:  Estimated historical and projected nitrous oxide and methane emissions in the agricultural \nsector of developing and developed countries during the period 1990-2020 \nThis reference also provides detailed charts on emission trends for further differentiated regions. (Smith et al. 2007, \np. 504)\nThe US-EPA report, on the other hand, is based on com-\npilation of a huge number of country reports and pro-\njections are mainly based on country specific national \ncommunications. These projections depict business as \nusual development including mitigation policies only if \na well-established programme for those is in place. The \nmethodological details of the country specific projec-\ntions are thus very diverse and such combination of dif-\nferent approaches is in fact problematic. All these sce-\nnarios thus describe \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d developments, \nnot capturing increased mitigation actions, as e.g. nec-\nessary to reach the two-degree goal by 2100.\n5.3  Mitigation Potential \nBased  on  the  assessments  reported  above,  Smith  et \nal. (2008) calculated the technical mitigation potential \nin agriculture for the year 2030 and the mitigation po-\ntential that is economically feasible at various carbon \nprices by the same year, based on cost estimates for \nthe  various  climate  friendly  practices  in  agriculture. \nMainly based on the marginal abatement cost curves \n(MACCs) as provided by US-EPA (2006b, ch.7), they find \nthat about 90 percent of the total mitigation potential \nin agriculture as identified in Smith et al. (2008) would \nbe  realised  by  increased  soil  carbon  sequestration,  9 \npercent by methane and only 2 percent by nitrous ox-\nide emissions reductions. \nN2O Manure\nN2O Soils\nN2O Burning\nCH4 Rice\nCH4 Manure\nCH4 Enteric\nCH4 Burning\nDeveloping regions Developed regions\n6,000\n5,000\n4,000\n3,000\n2,000\n1,000\n0\n1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 2020 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 202030\nConcretely, the measures behind these mitigation po-\ntentials are a) improved cropland management such as \ntillage, nutrient and water management; b) improved \ngrazing land management; c) reduced soil GHG emissions \nfrom bioenergy crops; d) improved rice management; e) \nrestoration of cultivated organic soils; f) restoration of \ndegraded land; g) improved livestock management; and \nh) improved manure management (cf. also section 6). \nMeasures beyond agriculture, e.g. changes in consump-\ntion patterns, are not assessed here. The respective mit-\nigation potential by 2030, which is economically feasible \nat prices of 30, 50 and 100$/tCO2-eq are 1.5-1.6, 2.5-2.7 \nand 4.0-4.3 GtCO2-eq/yr and can be put in relation to \ntotal emissions from the agricultural sector of 5.1-6.1 \nGtCO2-eq/yr. Interestingly, the different storylines, resp. \nmarker scenarios, did not translate into dramatically dif-\nferent mitigation potentials, or into dramatically differ-\nent areas for cropland and grassland, which drive these \nemissions.  The  variations  around  these  representative \nvalues within each scenario family are huge, though, il-\nlustrating the importance of specific modelling details. \nA drawback of this assessment is the fact that the MACCs \nused in the above analysis do not capture several prac-\ntices that are central to organic agriculture and have a \nbig mitigation potential, such as the mitigation potential \nof switching from synthetic to organic fertilizers (ma-\nnure and compost), increased use of grass-clover leys, \navoiding deforestation by restricting concentrate feed \nfor animals or increasing the longevity of dairy animals. \nAlso, options that go way beyond the agricultural sector \nsuch as a reduction in the number of ruminants, resp. \nin meat and dairy product consumption and reduced \nstorage losses and food wastage are not systematically \ncaptured in these mitigation potential scenarios. \nAnother drawback is that the storylines of the SRES sce-\nnarios deliver the grassland and cropland areas in 2030, \nmainly  in  the  absence  of  specific  agricultural  climate \npolicy, while the implementation of the climate friendly \npractices is not linked to the storylines driving the LU-\nLUCF development. However, implementation of the cli-\nmate friendly practices clearly necessitates the presence \nof some specific agricultural climate policies. Thus, this \nassessment is based on inconsistent combination of dif-\nferent modelling approaches. Furthermore, the MACCs \nused are based on other than the SRES scenarios (US-\nEPA 2006b). Similarly, the bioenergy assessment in Smith \net al. (2008) is based on literature that is not based on \nthe SRES scenarios.\nA thorough assessment of the mitigation potential of \nthese issues would need additional model development. \nA first indication can be developed along simple extrap-\nolation of the mitigation potential per area or animal \ncombined with some assumptions on the future devel-\nopment of area and animal numbers. The drawback of \nthis approach clearly is the absence of any interactions \nwith or linkage to other developments and key drivers \nor boundary conditions. \nAnother approach would be to assess regional or coun-\ntry specific and agricultural sub-sector projections in de-\ntail. Such an approach lacks the global or whole-sector \nscope but can capture regional or sub-sector develop-\nments. A systematic assessment of such approaches is \nbeyond the scope of this report. 31\n6  Climate friendly development \nin agriculture as blue-print \u2013 a \nnew paradigm \nThe previous sections have shown that agriculture is a \nlarge emitter of greenhouse gases, but also has a large \nmitigation potential, mainly through soil carbon seques-\ntration. Calls for mitigation in agriculture have become \nlouder in recent years. Climate friendly techniques and \npractices could serve as a blueprint for a re-design of \nthe agricultural sector. \nConsidering the profound importance and urgency to \nmitigate global climate change, climate friendly agricul-\nture must become the new paradigm. As already point-\ned out in the introduction, this must not compromise \nfood security and other sustainability aspects of agricul-\nture. This approach is thus related to the \u201cclimate-smart \nagriculture\u201d as defined in FAO (2010, Footnote 1): \n\u201c[\u2026] agriculture that sustainably increases \nproductivity, resilience (adaptation), reduces/\nremoves GHGs (mitigation), and enhances \nachievement of national food security and \ndevelopment goals.\u201d \nThe new paradigm we present here is even broader, as \nit  covers  aspects  of  consumer  behaviour  and  dietary \nchange as well. \n6.1  Practices of climate friendly \nagriculture \nMany  practices  leading  to  mitigation  are  already  well \nknown. Now it is of primary importance to develop poli-\ncies that help putting into practice the solutions that we \nalready have. Furthermore, research must continue to \nlook for further improvements and for new solutions \nof  climate  friendly  agriculture  while  maintaining  food \nsecurity.\nThis section presents the options for climate friendly ag-\nriculture. The policy aspects are addressed in section 9 \nbelow. A high mitigation potential can in principle be re-\nalized through four broad fields of action in agriculture \ndirectly and in its wider context (cf. above):\nreducing direct and indirect emissions from agricul-   z\nture; \nincreasing carbon sequestration in agricultural soils;    z\nchanging  dietary  patterns  towards  more  climate    z\nfriendly food consumption;\nreducing waste throughout all food chains.   z\nProducing biofuels to replace fossil fuels is a fifth mitiga-\ntion option that needs to be assessed. Implemented in a \nsustainable manner, it may be of only local and marginal \nimportance for overall agricultural mitigation, though. \nThe  overall  mitigation  effect  and  sustainability  of  this \noption is highly contested and we shortly take up this \ncontroversy in section 6.2.3.\nOn a first level of analysis, these mitigation options can \nbe described by single practices and measures that can \nbe implemented on various levels, from rather specif-\nic field management (1. and 2.) to more systemic ap-\nproaches (3. and 4.). Table 3 at the end of this section \ngives an overview of these mitigation practices and their \neffects, focusing in detail on direct agricultural practices \n(i.e. 1. and 2. from above). The more systemic approach-\nes and bioenergy are addressed in further detail below, \nin section 6.2. The suggested practices vary in type and \nextent of effect, which is in addition not always known \nand often variable. For many practices, exact effects are \nstill unclear, or strongly dependent on local factors. Of-\nten, interactions between different practices also play \nan important role (cf. also the assessment in sections 3, \n4 and 5).\n6.2  Principles of a new paradigm\nOn a second and more important level of analysis than \nthe level of single practices, a new paradigm for climate \nfriendly agriculture should be developed based on these \npractices. Single climate friendly practices can be applied \nin many contexts and often without much change in 32\nthe overall system. To develop a truly sustainable climate \nfriendly agriculture, though, more concerted action is \nnecessary. This means, that some guiding principles for \nclimate friendly agriculture and the related policies have \nto be derived. From the table of practices and the dis-\ncussion in the previous sections, five guiding principles \ncan be derived. A new paradigm for climate friendly ag-\nriculture needs to \naccount for trade-offs and choose system bounda-   z\nries adequately;\naccount  for  synergies  and  adopt  a  systemic  ap-   z\nproach;\naccount for aspects besides mitigation (e.g. adapta-   z\ntion, food security and biodiversity);\naccount for uncertainties and knowledge gaps;   z\naccount for the context beyond the agricultural sec-   z\ntor: in particular consumption and wastage patterns.\n6.2.1 Trade-offs and system boundaries\nTrade-offs have to be considered most prominently in \nno-till agriculture, animal husbandry, bioenergy produc-\ntion and some nitrous oxide dynamics. As one purpose \nof tillage is to decrease weed pressure, this is compen-\nsated through increased pesticide use and correspond-\ningly  higher  emissions  from  inputs  in  no-till  systems. \nNo-till  systems  are  often  also  tailor-made  for  certain \ncombinations of GMOs and pesticides with the corre-\nsponding dependence of farmers on the corporations \nthat supply those. \nIn addition, pesticides and herbicides are potentially de-\nposited in ecosystems and food chains. Trade-offs also \nexists  for  certain  mitigation  proposals  in  animal  hus-\nbandry, where increasing productivity and feed additives \nhave some potential for reducing methane emissions \nfrom  enteric  fermentation  but  mostly  have  adverse \neffects  on  animal  health  as  well,  which  also  reduces \nthe mitigation potential due to a reduced productive \nlifespan of animals (cf. section 6.2.3 below).\nBioenergy  production  faces  considerable  trade-offs, \nand there are still controversies regarding its net energy \nand greenhouse gas balance, and regarding its impact \non food security (for this latter point, see also 8.2.3 be-\nlow) (Muller 2009, Berndes 2010). \nCropping legumes and using organic fertilizers reduces \nthe need for external nitrogen input and thus avoids \ncorresponding emissions. With regard to nitrous oxide \nemissions,  there  are  indications  that  organic  fertiliz-\ners  produce  higher  emissions  than  synthetic  fertiliz-\ners  (Bouw  man  et  al.  2002),  though.  Single  cases  can \nalso point in the opposite direction (e.g. Alluvione et al. \n2010). Improvements regarding nitrous oxide emissions \nmay be realised by biogas fermentation or composting \nof legume biomass and not mulching it (M\u00f6ller and Stin-\nner 2009; Heuwinkel et al. 2005), and by adding bulking \nmaterial such as biochar or sawdust for optimal com-\npost production (see e.g. Dias et al. 2010). As already \npointed out above, figures of nitrous oxide emissions \nneed always to be regarded with great care, since they \nare affected by management and environment in com-\nplex ways.\nAlso related to nitrous oxide emissions is the trade-off \nthat higher soil carbon levels can correlate with higher \nnitrous oxide emissions, thus offsetting part of the miti-\ngation potential from soil carbon sequestration (Bouw-\nman et al. 2002; Li et al. 2005). It has to be considered \nthat nitrous oxide emissions and carbon sequestration \ndiffer regarding permanence, as the latter is non-per-\nmanent only, while the emissions, once realised, cannot \nbe undone. \nThe most prominent example illustrating system bound-\naries is the feed for ruminants. While concentrate feed \nmay reduce methane emissions from enteric fermen-\ntation by about a third compared with roughage rich \nfeed (Shibata and Terada 2010), the production of the \nconcentrate feed often causes heavy land use change \nand deforestation in particular. This is the case for soy \ncake, for example (see also the case study on Brazil, sec-\ntion 8.3). The losses in soil and biomass carbon following \nland use change and deforestation and the nitrous ox-\nide emissions from the fertilized crops for concentrate 33\nfeed production can offset the reduced methane emis-\nsions from concentrate feed. Employing global system \nboundaries, concentrate rich feed thus has higher emis-\nsions than a roughage rich diet. An optimized mixed sys-\ntem based on grassland and livestock can in some cases \neven be climate neutral (Soussana et al. 2010). \nSimilarly, the proposal to switch from ruminants to mo-\nnogastric animals such as pigs and poultry may not lead \nto reduced emissions under global system boundaries. \nThose animals do not emit much methane, and they \nare much more efficient in transforming plant protein \ninto animal protein than ruminants. They do however \nmainly eat concentrate feed with the above-mentioned \ndrawbacks and the competition with humans for valu-\nable  grain  commodities.  The  favourable  performance \nof these animals regarding methane emissions can thus \npartly be offset by CO2 emissions from concentrate feed \nproduction.\n6.2.2 Synergies and systemic approach\nSynergies most prominently arise in the context of soil \nand nutrient management. Using organic fertilizers such \nas crop residues or compost not only reduces emissions \nfrom production of synthetic fertilizers but also increas-\nes soil carbon sequestration. Higher soil carbon contents \nin turn reduce energy use for tillage, due to a less dense \nsoil structure, and for irrigation, due to higher water \nholding capacity. A higher soil carbon content has posi-\ntive effects beyond mitigation as well as it improves soil \nstructure and thus water holding and retention capacity, \nreduces soil erosion and improves soil biodiverstiy and \nsoil health in general (e.g. Niggli et al. 2009). \nRelated  is  the  optimal  synergy  between  animals  and \ngrassland.  An  optimal  stocking  rate  allows  producing \nanimal  products  in  a  basically  carbon  neutral  system, \nas the grasslands involved can build up soil carbon level \nand thus have a high soil carbon sequestration potential \n(e.g. Freibauer et al. 2004, Soussana et al. 2010). \nThis  already  points  to  the  importance  of  systemic  ap-\nproaches, where not only single practices for mitigation \nare considered, but a whole system of interlinked prac-\ntices  is  implemented  and  optimized,  duly  accounting \nfor other aspects than mitigation. The prime example of \nsuch a systemic approach is organic agriculture. Organic \nagriculture does apply most of the climate friendly prac-\ntices proposed by the IPCC 2007 (Niggli et al. 2009) in a \nwell-designed systemic context. This is important, as the \nvarious  trade-offs  and  synergies  between  different  cli-\nmate friendly practices necessitate the implementation \nof an encompassing systemic approach to fully harvest \nthe  mitigation  potential.  Merely  implementing  climate \nfriendly practices as independent pieces of mitigation ac-\ntions, e.g. in the context of an otherwise unchanged con-\nventional farming system, are likely not to achieve this. \nThe main building blocks of the mitigation potential in \norganic agriculture are a lower nitrogen input per ha (up \nto 60-70 percent less input, Niggli et al. 2009), the use of \norganic fertilizers and grass-clover/forage legumes leys, \nthe absence of biomass burning, the absence of emis-\nsion and energy intensive inputs such as synthetic fer-\ntilizers, pesticides and herbicides (Nemecek et al. 2010, \nin press), and the focus on soil fertility and soil health, \ni.e., among others, on soil carbon build-up. These as-\npects are integral part of the organic standards (IFOAM \n2011). The systemic aspects are realized by a systemic \napproach to pest, disease and weed management, with \na strong basis in plant and soil health, by closed nutrient \ncycles, e.g. by optimal combination of animal and crop \nfarming in mixed farming systems, and by using crop \nand animal varieties adapted to local conditions and cli-\nmate friendly management practices. It is still subject \nto ongoing research whether organic pest and disease \nmanagement are compatible with reduced tillage and \nnon-permanently flooded rice cropping practices such \nas the System of Rice Intensification SRI. \nOrganic agriculture and agroecology have been champi-\noned as most sustainable forms of agriculture also with \nregard  to  soil  carbon  sequestration  (e.g.  De  Schutter \n2010a,  El-Hage  Scialabba  and  M\u00fcller-Lindenlauf  2010). \nLeifeld and Fuhrer (2010) analysed a total of 68 data sets \nfrom 32 peer-reviewed publications comparing conven-\ntional with organic agriculture. On average, soil organic \ncarbon (SOC) contents in organic agriculture increased by \n2.2 percent annually, while in conventional agriculture, 34\nSOC did not change significantly. As analysis of conven-\ntional systems with organic fertilizers shows, this differ-\nence is less due to the farming system as such than due \nto the use or absence of organic fertilizers. However, \ndetailed carbon sequestration values for organic farm-\ning cannot be gained from their analysis as SOC stocks \nare often missing as well as SOC values determined at \nthe start of farming system comparison. More scientific \nresearch is needed to evaluate the specific carbon ben-\nefits of these practices due to organic farming. This is \nparticularly important for organic farming practices in \ndeveloping countries. In a current literature review Gat-\ntinger et al. (in preparation) found no reliable compara-\ntive data on the SOC development under organic and \nconventional  management  from  Africa  and  Mid  and \nSouth America. This is one important reason why the Re-\nsearch Institute of Organic Agriculture (FiBL), Switzerland \ninitiated 3 years ago farming system comparison trials \n(organic vs. conventional) in Kenya, Bolivia and India rep-\nresenting regionally important cropping systems. \nA very gross and preliminary estimate of the mitigation \npotential from conversion to organic agriculture from \nNiggli et al. (2009) is a reduction by 40 percent of the \nworld\u2019s agricultural greenhouse gas emissions, and by \n65 percent if combined with reduced tillage techniques. \nThis would reduce yields in intensively farmed regions \nunder  the  best  climate  conditions  by  one  third  but \ncould significantly improve yields under low-input situa-\ntions (Niggli et al. 2009). This illustrates that productivity \ndifferences have to be seen in such a broader context. \nMaeder et al. (2002) reported an increased efficiency of \ninput use of organic agriculture. Fertilizer inputs were \nlower by 50 to 60 percent in comparison to conven-\ntional management, while the crop yield reduction was \nless than 20 percent. It is also important to mention that \nsuch increased input efficiency has direct positive eco-\nnomic effects as it lowers input costs per unit output. \nWe  emphasize  that  the  general,  aggregate  estimates \ngiven above are of very gross and preliminary nature, \nwhile numbers from single experiments, field trials and \ncomparisons can be very accurate for the case in consid-\neration, but cannot be generalised to a global estimate.\n6.2.3 Aspects besides mitigation\nA new paradigm for climate friendly agriculture must \naccount for other sustainability aspects than mitigating \nclimate change. Agriculture has multiple functions in so-\nciety and mitigation is not the most important goal. This \nmeans,  that  mitigation  measures  in  agriculture  must \nnot  only  be  evaluated  according  to  their  mitigation \npotential, but also according to their effects on other \nsustainability indicators such as food security, adaptive \ncapacity,  rural  livelihoods,  various  ecosystem  services, \nnutrient and water management and impacts on soil, \nwater and air quality. \nA focus on soil fertility, i.e. on soil carbon sequestration \nperforms well regarding such aspects, as it improves soil \nstructure and thus water holding and retention capacity, \nthus making agriculture more resilient against extreme \nweather events such as heavy rains and droughts and \nit avoids water logging. Improved soil fertility also im-\nproves plant health and correspondingly increases the \ncapacity to deal with pest and diseases, which is crucial \nin the context of adaptation to climate change, where \nincreased  pest  and  disease  pressure  is  expected.  This \nadvantageous  performance  of  an  agricultural  system \nfocusing on soil fertility is further improved by choos-\ning optimal crop rotations and locally adapted varieties. \nSimilarly,  optimal  nutrient  management  and  recycling \nplays a role, as increasing soil organic matter contents \ndepends on organic fertilizer inputs. Composting, leg-\numes and avoiding biomass waste burning are crucial \nfor these aspects. Furthermore, a smallholder focus is \noften  seen  as  crucial  for  food  security  in  developing \ncountries (Lal 2009).\nThese options are largely in line with organic agriculture \nand  are  also  in  accordance  with  the  approaches  de-\nscribed in the FAO report on \u201cFood Security and Agri-\ncultural Mitigation in Developing Countries\u201d (FAO 2009) \nand of other governmental and NGO documents with \na similar focus (e.g. Soil Association 2009 or FAO 2010). \nFAO (2009), for example, finds that many climate-friend-\nly farming practices at the same time promise economic \ngains for developing country farmers and they conclude \nthat 35\n\u201e[t]he potential for synergies is particularly \nhigh for changing food production practices \nsuch as adopting improved crop varieties; \navoiding bare fallow and changing crop rota-\ntions to incorporate food-producing cover \ncrops and legumes; increasing fertilizer use \nin regions with low N content (as in much \nof sub-Saharan Africa), and adopting preci-\nsion fertilizer management in other regions; \nseeding fodder and improving forage quality \nand quantity on pastures; expansion of low \nenergy-intensive irrigation; and, expansion \nof agroforestry and soil and water conserva-\ntion techniques that do not take significant \namounts of land out of food production.\u201c \n(FAO 2009, p.24)\nUsing organic fertilizers is absent in this list, but it is \nmentioned as advantageous at various other places in \nthis report (e.g. footnote no. 7, p20). In the context of \nfood security, Badgley et al. (2007) showed with a review \nof 293 studies on productivity that organic agriculture \ncan meet the food security challenge on a global basis \n(see also El-Hage Scialabba 2007).\nThe main points of debate between organic agriculture \nand these similar other suggestions as mentioned in the \nprevious paragraph refer to the use of synthetic fertiliz-\ners, to pest and disease control, and the use of GMOs. \nUsing organic fertilizers has many advantages, but there \nis no need to exclusively use those. Some synthetic fer-\ntilizer  application  can  make  much  sense,  in  particular \nin  nutrient-deficient  regions,  and  where  biomass  and \nresidues  for  composting  and  other  organic  fertiliser \nis  scarce.  Similarly,  avoiding  pesticides  and  herbicides \nwould be optimal, but in some cases moderate use of \nsome substances is very effective without overly bur-\ndening the environment. This mainly depends on the \ntypes of chemicals used and their toxicity. \nGMOs, finally, are most controversial. GMO technology \nmay help to considerably hasten plant breeding, but it \nis connected with potentially huge ecological as well as \nsocioeconomic risks that need to be managed based on \nthe  precautionary  principle.  Another  important  ques-\ntion  is  whether  locally  adapted  traditional  breeding \ntechniques may not perform similarly or better. More \ndetailed  discussion  of  GMOs  is  however  beyond  the \nscope of this report.\nA second broad area besides soil fertility where an in \ndepth discussion of aspects besides mitigation is need-\ned is the animal sector. Animal welfare and health are \nthe crucial topics. There are many proposals to mitigate \nmethane emissions from ruminants, either by feeding \npractices, by feeding additives to inhibit methanogen-\nesis or by breeding programmes. Many of these affect \nanimal  health  adversely,  though,  as  they  go  counter \nphysiological characteristics of the ruminants. Concen-\ntrate  feed  reduces  methane  emissions  considerable \nwith regard to roughage (reduction by one third) (Shi-\nbata and Terada 2010). \nVarious feed additives are tested with the goal to (fur-\nther) reduce methane emissions from enteric fermenta-\ntion. Some feed additives such as fatty acids or tannins \nseem promising (4-5 percent of lipids added to the feed \nreduce emissions by 15-20 percent) (Martin et al. 2010) \nbut  more  research  is  still  needed  (Sejian  et  al.  2010). \nFeed  additives  with  characteristics  of  antibiotics  and \nother  drugs  are  highly  problematic.  A  short  overview \non some feed additives is given in Smith et al. (2008). \nAlthough clearly reducing emissions per unit output, in-\ncreasing the productivity of animals towards higher milk \nyields and faster growth (for meat), also increases their \nhealth problems (e.g. mastitis) and reduces their lifetime \nperformance. \nA third area where a critical discussion is crucial is bioen-\nergy and biofuel production in particular. One problem \nis the fact that agricultural land dedicated to bioenergy \nproduction is lost for food production. In addition, in-\ncreasing bioenergy production may lead to indirect land \nuse change, as it shifts agricultural production into for-\nest areas with corresponding deforestation. There are \nstrong indications that the recent food price rises were \nat least partly driven by the expansion of energy crops \n(e.g. Mitchell 2008). Besides this competition for land, \nthere is also a competition for water and for biomass \n(see  e.g.  Muller  2009).  This  latter  point  is  particularly 36\nimportant for the context of climate friendly agricul-\nture and the important role of organic fertilizer for it. \nParticular attention has to be paid to the local situation \nof  subsistence  farmers,  as  bioenergy  strategies  may \nexclude certain groups from their traditional land use \nwith  correspondingly  adverse  consequences  for  local \nfood security of these groups, in particular in contexts \nof informal property and use rights. A clear statement \non whether and to which extent bioenergy can be pro-\nduced in a climate friendly agriculture and compatible \nwith food security is currently not possible, but when \nreforming agriculture \u2013 and the energy system \u2013 these \naspects and trade-offs clearly need to be kept in mind. \nFor this, the emissions and energy balance of bioener-\ngy and biofuels in particular need to be assessed on an \nencompassing life-cycle basis. Depending on the pro-\nduction system and its management, the net emissions \ngains from biofuels can be nil or even negative (e.g. De-\nlucchi 2010). \nIn summary, there are strong synergies between many \nmitigation and other ecological sustainability objectives \nand food security, while there are concerns regarding \nsome  mitigation  approaches  and  animal  welfare,  and \nalso regarding mitigation based on bioenergy.\n6.2.4 Uncertainties \u2013 knowledge gaps\nAs already pointed out repeatedly in the previous sec-\ntions, there are still many uncertainties and knowledge \ngaps regarding the potential effects of specific mitiga-\ntion  options,  their  adverse  or  synergistic  interaction, \nand  underlying  processes.  This  situation  considerably \ninfluences  the  monitoring,  reporting  and  verification \napproaches that are related to quantification in climate \nfriendly  agriculture.  Whether  quantification  of  some \nmitigation  potential  is  possible  on  a  detailed,  single \nfarm level, on a more aggregate level and in form of \na rough tendency only, or whether it is not possible at \nall depends on these uncertainties and knowledge gaps \nand policies supporting climate-friendly agriculture. This \nchallenge needs to be taken into account explicitly. \nA particular case where a cautious approach regarding \nquantification is important is the assessment of produc-\ntivity in organic agriculture and the assessment of the \nmitigation potential per unit output (e.g. crop yield) or \nper area. Any comparison of systemic agricultural ap-\nproaches  with  complex  crop  rotations,  high  on-farm \ndiversity, etc. with conventional systems based on mo-\nno-cropping faces considerable challenges as assigning \nemissions to units of a certain output is very difficult or \neven impossible. \nThe potentially lower yields for some crops under or-\nganic management can reduce the mitigation potential \nof organic agriculture. The carbon footprint of organi-\ncally grown potatoes for example, if measured on a per \nkg output basis, is higher (Nemecek et al. 2010, in press) \nwhereas for organically grown wheat the carbon foot-\nprint was lower than for the corresponding convention-\nal crops (Hirschfeld et al. 2008). \nIn summary there are not only direct uncertainties and \nknowledge gaps regarding emissions and sequestration \nof certain practices, but also \u201cprocedural\u201d uncertainties \nregarding how to correctly quantify mitigation in multi-\nfunctional contexts.\n6.2.5 Broader context \u2013 Consumption patterns\nAddressing  consumption  patterns  is  the  most  vision-\nary  guiding  principle  for  climate  friendly  agriculture. \nIt makes clear that successful mitigation in agriculture \nmust deal with issues well beyond the core issues of this \nsector. This is so, as the most effective way to reduce \nmethane emissions from ruminants is a reduction in the \nnumber of animals (cf. e.g. Stehfest et al. 2009 for an \nassessment of the mitigation effects of reduced meat \nconsumption). This clearly is viable only when the con-\nsumption of animal products and of meat in particular \ndecreases correspondingly. \nA certain number of animals is necessary for rural liveli-\nhoods, food security (as many areas are not suitable for \ncrop production but still can produce animal protein if \nused extensively), nutrient management and the pro-\nduction of fuel and fibre. A high and increasing number \nof animals however negatively affects food security, as it \ndirectly competes for land with food production and as 37\nthe efficiency for nutrient protein from animals is much \nlower than from plants (Carlsson-Kanayama and Gonzal-\nez 2009). An optimized grassland/animal farm system \ncan even be climate neutral, at least for some period of \ntime (Soussana et al. 2010). \nBesides  changing  the  quantities  of  certain  food  con-\nsumption,  consumer  aspects  are  relevant  for  all  the \nmeasures that involve changes in types and varieties of \nfood. Examples are the promotion of new (or old and \ncurrently not used) pest-resistant varieties, of seasonal/\nregional  food  (if  grown  without  fossil  heated  green-\nhouses) and of meat from monogastric animals (if fed \nwith sustainably grown feedstuff). All these measures \ncrucially hinge on consumer acceptance.\nReducing food wastage, finally, has a big potential, as \nin developing countries much food is lost due to poor \nstorage  facilities  (30  to  40  percent)  and  in  developed \ncountries food is wasted in final use, i.e. thrown away \nin retailers, restauration and households (again 30 to 40 \npercent) (Godfray et al. 2010). This could be changed \nwith  improved  infrastructure  in  developing  countries. \nIn developed countries, it would need a change in atti-\ntudes and expectations of consumers and suppliers (on \nimmediate availability, freshness, look of the food, etc.).38\nMeasure Mitigation effect Sources\nCrops and \nfarming system \nmanagement\nImprove crop varieties and productivity\nReduces direct (and indirect) \nemissions per kg yield IPCC recommenda-\ntions Smith et al. \n2007; Muller and \nAubert, forthcoming\nImprove residue management e.g. avoid biomass \nburning\nReduces direct emissions\nReduce reliance on external inputs (e.g. include \nnitrogen fixing plants into crop rotations)\nReduces direct and indirect \nemissions\nIntroduce legumes into grasslands (to enhance \nproductivity)\nReduces direct nitrous oxide \nand indirect emissions\nIPCC recommenda-\ntions Smith et al. \n2007\nOptimized Rice management (e.g. System of Rice \nIntensification SRI \u2013 not flooded)\nReduces methane (but may \nincrease nitrous oxide; - more \nresearch needed)\nSass 2003; Neue \n1993; US-EPA 2010, \nch. 6; Wassmann et \nal. 2000, Wassmann \nand Dobermann 2006\nWell-managed combined animal-grassland systems  Can be climate neutral Soussana et al. 2010\nFertilizer, \nmanure and \nbiomass man-\nagement\nReduce use and production of synthetic fertilizers\nReduces direct and indirect \nemissions.

First, the UNFCCC and its poli-\ncies are described in brief. Then, past policy perform-\nance  and  current  negotiations  are  critically  assessed. \nThe section then gives an overview over the on-going \ndiscussions on future UN policies for mitigation in agri-\nculture and draws some conclusions.\n7.1  Introduction to UN climate policies\nIn its narrow sense, the UNFCCC provides the UN frame-\nwork on multilateral action to mitigate and adapt to glo-\nbal climate change (UN 1992). The Kyoto protocol, an \naddition to the UNFCCC, sets legally binding targets for \nclimate change mitigation (UN 1998). In its wider sense, \nthe  UNFCCC  stands  for  the  UN  institutions  through \nwhich  international  negotiations  and  agreements  re-\ngarding climate change mitigation and adaptation are \nmanaged (www.unfccc.int). It is important to carefully \ndistinguish between the convention and the Kyoto pro-\ntocol. The USA, for instance, is party to the convention, \nbut not to the protocol and has thus not committed to \nlegally binding emissions reduction goals. \nThe  UNFCCC  has  a  permanent  secretariat  situated  in \nBonn, which supports all institutions involved in the cli-\nmate change process. Member states to the UNFCCC \n(parties) meet regularly at the so-called Conferences of \nthe Parties (COPs), where the course for global climate \npolicy is set. The 16th and most recent COP took place \nin Canc\u00fan, Mexico, in November/ December 2010, the \nnext will take place in Durban, South Africa, November/\nDecember 2011. \nThe  UNFCCC  obliges  countries  to  \u201cmitigate  climate \nchange  by  addressing  anthropogenic  emissions  by \nsources and removals by sinks of all greenhouse gases\u201d \n(UN 1992, article 4). Article 2 of the Kyoto protocol says \nthat in order to achieve emission reductions, each party \nto the convention shall implement certain policies and \nmeasurements, among others \u201cPromotion of sustain-\nable forms of agriculture in light of climate change con-\nsideration\u201d (UN 1998, article 2.1 a (iii)). The Kyoto proto-\ncol sets reduction targets for developed countries (the \nso-called Annex I or Annex B countries, according to the \nlist provided in Annex I to the Convention and Annex B \nto the Kyoto Protocol) and allows carbon emissions to \nbe offset by demonstrated removal of carbon from the \natmosphere, for instance through \u201cremovals by sinks in \nthe agricultural soils\u201d (Article 3.4). Two important bodies \nto the convention are the \u201cAd Hoc Working Group on \nLong-term Cooperative Action under the Convention\u201d \n(AWG-LCA), which was established in the context of the \nBali Action Plan 2007 at COP 13 (UN 2008) and the \u201cAd \nHoc Working Group on Further Commitments for An-\nnex I Parties under the Kyoto Protocol\u201d (AWG-KP), estab-\nlished in 2005. These groups negotiate the framework \nfor future global climate policy beyond 2012, when the \nfirst commitment period of the Kyoto-protocol ends.\nThe UNFCCC and the Kyoto protocol introduced several \nmechanisms  and  institutions  that  shape  the  interna-\ntional climate change mitigation activities: First, there \nare the so-called \u201cflexibility mechanisms\u201d of the Kyoto \nProtocol,  i.e.  emission  trading,  joint  implementation \nand the clean development mechanism (CDM). Second, \nthere are the national greenhouse gas inventories of the \nnations subjected to binding emission targets (Annex I \nparties) that report national emissions and sequestra-\ntion on an annual basis, in order to assess and docu-\nment  achievement  of  the  Kyoto  targets.  Third,  there \nis REDD+ (Reducing emissions from Deforestation and \nForest  Degradation  in  Developing  Countries  and  sup-\nporting conservation and sustainable management of \nforests and enhancing forest carbon stocks in develop-\ning countries). While the rules are clear for the flexibility \nmechanisms and the inventories for the current com-\nmitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, rules for subse-\nquent commitment periods and for REDD+ are still to be \ndecided and institutionalised. Finally, NAMAs (Nationally \nAppropriate  Mitigation  Actions)  are  gaining  increasing \nimportance as a future mitigation institution. Currently, \nthey are not defined at all and discussions on concre-42\ntisation are ongoing. All this will also affect the stand-\ning of agriculture in the UN climate policies, as there is \nan ongoing discussion on whether and how agriculture \nshould be covered in these contexts in the future. \nAlthough the awareness in the UNFCCC for the potential \nrole of agriculture in mitigating climate change and in \nparticular of soil carbon sequestration is reflected in the \nrelevant documents, agriculture is not playing a promi-\nnent role in UN climate policies as shown below.\n7.2  The role of agriculture in UNFCCC \npolicies in the past\nAgriculture and land use, land use change and forestry \n(LULUCF)  played  a  minor  role  in  mitigating  emissions \nin the past (IATP 2010 for a detailed overview, see also \nBenn  dorf et al. 2007; Murphy et al. 2009a). The clean \ndevelopment  mechanism  (CDM)  excludes  soil  carbon \nsequestration  from  agriculture,  which  represents  90 \npercent of agriculture`s mitigation potential (FAO 2010). \nRegarding agricultural sink activities, the CDM is restrict-\ned to afforestation and reforestation. According to the \nrules  on  national  GHG  inventories,  agricultural  sector \nemissions have to be reported on. From LULUCF, only \nreforestation, afforestation and deforestation have to \nbe reported on, while GHG emissions and sequestration \ndue  to  cropland  and  grassland  management  are  not \nmandatory for the inventories.\nThe reasons for the exclusion of agriculture date back \nto the negotiations that led to the Kyoto Protocol and \nsubsequent amendments (e.g. the Marrakech Accords \n(UNFCCC  2002),  where  the  detailed  rules  for  LULUCF \nwere resolved and agreed on. The FAO (2008) notes that \nagriculture is considered difficult and that it has there-\nfore been neglected, despite the fact that it is clearly \nacknowledged that the agricultural sector has the po-\ntential  to  contribute  substantially  to  greenhouse  gas \nemission reduction (Metz et al. 2007). \nThe difficulties mainly refer to huge heterogeneity in the \nsector, i.e. the large number and variety of farming sys-\ntems, agro-ecosystems and farmers, the complexities of \nthe agricultural sector with regard to measurement, re-\nporting and verification of emissions and sequestration \npotentials and the perceived lack of and expense asso-\nciated with robust methodologies for this (FAO 2008). \nFurther challenges stem from leakage (displacement of \nemissions), financial barriers, and non-permanence (car-\nbon sequestration in agricultural soil is non-permanent) \n(Murphy et al. 2009b). \nAn additional barrier is the recognition of the fact that \nfood production will have to be increased to feed a ris-\ning world population (e.g. Lal 2010). Thus, as many argue, \nit plays a special role and should not be pressurized by \ncarbon reduction targets. Many countries regard agri-\ncultural production as a sovereign right directly linked to \nfood security. They do not wish this sector to be under \nthe influence or control of an international body (Mur-\nphy et al. 2009b). \nAlthough agriculture played a limited role in past UN cli-\nmate negotiations and has been approached \u201cin a frag-\nmented manner\u201d only (Murphy et al. 2009b), action has \ntaken place on the ground, with many countries having \nincluded agriculture in their national agendas (Murphy \n2011). This is reflected in the Nationally Appropriate Miti-\ngation Actions (NAMA), which list mitigation policies and \nactivities of developing countries. Some countries are \nquite detailed on those and some include agricultural \nprojects, such as massively increasing compost and or-\nganic fertilizer use in Ethiopia and Ghana, no tillage in \nBrazil or increased soil carbon sequestration in Indonesia \n(Fukuda and Tamura 2010, UNFCCC 2011g). \nAction has also been taken on adaptation in agriculture. \nIt is widely acknowledged that agriculture faces consid-\nerable threats from climate change over the next dec-\nades  and  that  successful  adaptation  is  of  paramount \nimportance for food security and poverty alleviation for \nhundreds of millions of people (Lal 2009, 2010). Adapta-\ntion and related policies are less institutionalised than \nmitigation. The National Adaptation Programmes of Ac-\ntion NAPAs are an \u2013 albeit very heterogeneous \u2013 pool \ncollecting envisaged and planned national policies and \nactivities for adaptation, in a similar spirit as NAMAs col-\nlect  such  envisaged  and  planned  mitigation  activities \n(UNFCCC 2011b).43\n7.3  The role of agriculture in current \nUNFCCC negotiations\nWhile agriculture played a minor role in the past, there \nhas been a shift in recent negotiations: Prior to 2010, \nonly minimal progress has been made to capitalize on \nopportunities in the agricultural sector, while observers \nfrom 2010 claim that agriculture`s role is increasing sig-\nnificantly. \n\u201cAgriculture (\u2026) is one of the areas that \nmade greatest progress within the formal \nUNFCCC negotiations over 2009 and in early \n2010\u201d \nsay Murphy et al. (2010b). The question if agricultural soil \ncarbon sequestration should be included in emissions \nand removals accounting, was for instance discussed at \nthe COP in Copenhagen in 2009. \nOther indicators that mitigation related to the agricul-\ntural sector is gaining in profile in the UNFCCC negotia-\ntions (Murphy et al. 2010b) include the work of the AWG-\nLCA. This working group has written a technical paper on \nthe challenges and opportunities for mitigation in the \nagricultural sector (UNFCCC 2008). A lot of the general \nprogress with regard to the inclusion of agriculture was \nmade due to this working group. A draft text \u201cCoop-\nerative sectoral approaches and sector/specific actions \nin agriculture\u201d (ADAC 2009) was produced at COP 15 in \nCopenhagen (Dec. 2009). No decisions were taken con-\ncerning this draft, though, and the COP agreed to con-\ntinue the work of the group. \nNo big changes have been made in the draft LCA text \nabout agriculture during 2011. In the meeting of the \nAWG-LCA in April negotiations did not move at all, and \nagriculture was not discussed. In June parties met again, \nand this time agriculture created debate. However, not \nso much about the content, but about the placement of \nagriculture within the negotiations. In preparation of the \nmeeting, intergovernmental organisations (e.g. the FAO) \nand NGOs (e.g. ITAP) submitted comments on market-\nbased and non-market based mechanisms to enhance \nmitigation actions and claimed that such mechanisms \nneed to account for agriculture\u2019s characteristics (UNFCCC \n2011f). The other working group \u2013 the AWG-KP \u2013 has also \ncontributed to strengthening agriculture`s role by sub-\nmitting a request that describes modalities and proce-\ndures for possible additional LULUCF activities under the \nCDM (e.g. revegetation, cropland management, grazing \nland  management,  wetland  management,  soil  carbon \nmanagement in agriculture) (Murphy et al. 2010a). \nIn October a third session took place in Panama. Again \nthe discussion focused on how agriculture, as well as \nother  sectors,  should  be  treated  within  the  negotia-\ntions, rather than how agriculture as a sector could be \nlinked to the climate change agenda. However, the de-\nbate about the text was also reopened and it now in-\ncludes various options (e.g about the link between ag-\nriculture and trade) which needs to be resolved before \na text about agriculture can be adopted in Durban (ENB \n2011).\nThe FAO appears as a stakeholder with own interests in \nthe  UNFCCC  negotiations.  For  instance,  the  FAO  pre-\npared a report in advance of the COP in Canc\u00fan (FAO \n2010).  This  report  advocates  for  a  stronger  financial \nsupport of agriculture, arguing that agriculture needs \nsubstantial  investments  to  become  \u201cclimate-smart\u201d, \nmeaning to be able to cope with adaptation, while utiliz-\ning its full mitigation potential and still increasing yields. \nThe FAO generally emphasizes in their publications how \ndeeply involved agriculture is with climate change and \nacts upon this through several efforts and initiatives re-\nlated to climate-friendly agriculture. \nThe  increasing  importance  of  agriculture  in  climate \nchange mitigation is also reflected beyond the UNFCCC, \ne.g. in the rapidly increasing number of agricultural off-\nsetting methodologies for the voluntary carbon market \n(T-AGG 2009; Coren 2010) or in the upcoming discussions \non  the  inclusion  of  agriculture  in  existing  or  planned \nemission trading schemes (IETA 2010). \nDespite the fact that some progress was achieved at the \nCOPs in Copenhagen and Canc\u00fan, discussions on many \ndetails are continuing. It is argued that agriculture is a \nmain cause of deforestation and should therefore also 44\nbe considered in REDD+ mechanisms, which is not the \ncase so far (Parker et al. 2009; Arens et al. 2010; Murphy \net al. 2010a). Without a substantial change in policies, \ngreenhouse gas emissions from agriculture could rise \nby 40 percent by 2030, the UN Special Rapporteur on \nthe right to food warned, urging negotiators at the Can-\nc\u00fan Climate Summit to \u201cconsider climate and agricul-\ntural policies together\u201d (De Schutter 2010b).\nIt is discussed whether reporting on LULUCF emissions \nbeyond forestry, in particular sequestration in and emis-\nsions from agricultural soils, should be made obligatory \nfor developed countries for the post-2012 period, so \nthat it would count towards overall greenhouse gas re-\nduction targets. There is also some discussion to cover \nagriculture under future REDD+ regulations (\u201cREDD++\u201d \nas it is sometimes called, IATP 2010; see also Arens et al. \n2010 and Parker et al. 2009).\nTo summarize, discussions are shifting towards a broad-\ner inclusion of agriculture and there are (internal) texts \nthat can serve as a basis for further discussion (e.g. the \none presented in the AWG-LCA on June 17, ENB 2011). \nThe question on how to shape the future role of agricul-\nture in UNFCCC policies remains important.\n7.4  The potential role of agriculture in \nUNFCCC policies the future\nGiven the recent policy developments and the progress \nof science regarding uncertainties and costs in report-\ning and monitoring of emission reductions and carbon \nsequestration in agriculture, soil carbon sequestration \nand other agricultural mitigation options likely will play a \nmore important role in the future (Murphy et al. 2010b). \nStakeholders in favour of such a development, such as \nthe FAO, claim that finances are needed for agriculture \nto become climate friendly. \n\u201cThrough ambitious programmes and poli-\ncies, a \u2018Green Marshall Plan\u2019 for agriculture \nwould scale up agro-ecological approaches \ntowards more sustainable modes of agri-\nculture which are sensitive to the needs of \nvulnerable communities,\u201d \nsaid the UN Special Rapporteur on the right to food at \nthe beginning of the Canc\u00fan conference (De Schutter \n2010b).\nThose who argue in favour of increasing agriculture\u2019s \nrole emphasize the positive side-effects that an inclu-\nsion would have \u2013 for instance on smallholder livelihoods \ndependent on agriculture, especially in Africa (Murphy \net al. 2010b). Also, sustainable agricultural practices de-\nliver benefits such as increased soil fertility, enhanced \ndrought and flood resistance and thus better adapta-\ntion capacities in a changing climate (Metz et al. 2007). \nGrowth of emissions from agriculture and deforestation \nactivities (with agriculture being their major cause) oc-\ncurs mainly in developing countries, where most of the \nglobal agricultural production takes place (Nabuurs et al. \n2007; Smith et al. 2007). Thus, according to proponents, \nincluding agriculture more into UNFCCC policies might \nbe a key factor for success in broader sustainable de-\nvelopment, while missing this chance would mean that \npoor, agriculture-based countries remain largely exclud-\ned from accessing the different types of climate change \nmitigation financing (Murphy et al. 2009b). \nThe  choice  of  policy  instruments  for  a  potentially  in-\ncreased role of agriculture in UNFCCC policies is crucial \nfor the sustainability of mitigation policies in agriculture. \nMany NGOs point at the risks of addressing mitigation \npolicy in agriculture with market-based mechanisms: Ad-\nditional money entering agriculture in such ways might \nsupport large-scale and \u201cbusiness as usual industrial agri-\nculture\u201d as well as landgrabbing, rather than supporting \ntruly  sustainable,  environmentally  friendly  agriculture \n(Jordan 03.02.2011; Econexus 2009; IATP 2010). As the \nInternational  Federation  of  Organic  Agriculture  Move-\nments  IFOAM  (03.02.2011)  argues,  organic  agriculture \naccounts only for a few percent of the total agricultural \nproduction area \u2013 thus, only a tiny share of the carbon \nfinancing  would  be  dedicated  to  organic  production. \nInstead,  the  policy  instruments  might  be  abused  for \ngreenwashing conventional agricultural practices. \nThose criticisms are partly linked to a general rejection \nof market-based policy tools such as emission trading. \nSome NGOs advocate for abolishing the CDM and related 45\nmarket mechanism completely. According to them, off-\nsetting provides loopholes so that emission reductions \nonly appear on paper. Instead of being allowed to shift \nthe burden of mitigation to poor countries, the devel-\noped countries should be required to do so domestically \n(e.g. Third World Network 2010). \nWhile part of the NGOs emphasize the potential role of \nmitigation  in  agriculture,  other  NGOs  argue  also  that \nadaptation and food security and not mitigation should \nbe the focus of climate policy in agriculture. The Third \nWorld Network (2010), for example, claims that expand-\ning the CDM to include soil carbon sequestration projects \nwould be \u201ca dangerous distraction from the more ur-\ngent needs of agricultural adaptation\u201d, and would allow \ndeveloped countries to continue emission intensive ag-\nriculture domestically. It argues that most importantly, \nmoney must be provided for developing countries for \nagricultural adaptation to climate change, in order to \nensure food security. This money shall be provided with-\nout conditions.\nIt seems generally agreed that mitigation through land-\nuse measures in agriculture and forestry has a large po-\ntential to contribute to the goal of the UNFCCC \u2013 es-\npecially with regard to contributions from developing \ncountries. However, the question remains how to best \nutilize this potential in the context of climate policies, in \nparticular, whether offset mechanisms such as the CDM \nor emissions trading are adequate for this, and how to \ndeal with associated risks.\n7.5  Concluding remarks\nIt is likely that agriculture will play an increased role in the \nclimate  change  regime  after  2012.  However,    whether \nthis  inclusion  will  succeed  in  facilitating  the  urgently \nneeded global turn towards climate-friendly, sustainable \nagriculture, or whether it will instead support the op-\nposite, depends on the details. \nFirst, the detailed design of the institutional framework \nfor broader inclusion of agriculture in climate policy is \ndecisive. It is alluring to call for more money for agri-\ncultural investments, but this is clearly not enough. The \nnumerous concerns, but also ideas of NGOs, should be \nheard and included into UNFCCC policy debates to find \nways to ensure that a shift to truly sustainable agriculture \nis supported. Important aspects relate to the livelihoods \nand rights of smallholders and indigenous people, and \nto food security. These aspects have to be considered \nwhen analysing the potential of offsets and other mar-\nket based mechanisms in particular. There is a danger to \nreduce agriculture to its carbon sink effects disregard-\ning broader sustainability aspects. That market-based in-\nstruments are vulnerable to these problems can be seen \nfrom the negative experiences in the EU-ETS (registry \nfrauds), the CDM (lack of additionality) and REDD related \nprojects (indigenous peoples rights).\nThis  links  to  a  second  concern,  namely  that  climate \nchange  mitigation  is  only  one  aspect  of  sustainability \nand others of equal or even more importance must not \nbe neglected when supporting mitigation in agriculture. \nExamples are primarily adaptation, but also water and \nsoil resources, nutrient management, biodiversity, etc.\nThird, reliable measurement, reporting and verification \n(MRV)  of  emission  reductions  and  sequestration  will \nremain an important issue. In particular offset mecha-\nnisms  such  as  emission  trading  and  the  CDM  rely  on \nhigh standards of MRV to make sense. Here, caution is \nadvised on which types of mitigation actions may meet \nthe  necessary  standards  (soil  nitrous  oxide  emissions, \nfor example, are still very difficult to quantify). \nFourth, and related to this, is the fact that setting strict \nboundary conditions can help increase MRV standards, \nbut  may  be  incompatible  with  systemic  agricultural \npractices, such as organic agriculture, where complex \ncrop rotations and organic fertilizers make it difficult to \ncompare the system to a baseline to calculate emission \nreductions.  Approaches  based  on  standardisation  and \nquantification are biased towards industrialised, large-\nscale agricultural systems based on monocultures and \nchemical fertilizers. Mitigation in agriculture thus must \nnot be achieved at the expense of sustainable cropping \nsystems.46\n8  Assessing national policies \u2013 \ncase studies\nIn this section, we present three case studies. They cov-\ner EU policies and the country cases of Indonesia and \nBrazil. \n8.1  The EU Common Agricultural Policy \n(CAP) \n8.1.1 Greenhouse gas emissions from the \nEuropean agricultural sector\nEU agriculture (Agriculture, forestry and fisheries) is re-\nsponsible for 534.8 million tonnes CO2-eq in GHG emis-\nsions which is 10.6 percent of total EU emissions in 2007 \n(EC 2010c) (cf. section 3). The by far largest emitter of \nGHG in the agricultural sector is France with 104.6 mil-\nlion tonnes CO2-eq followed by Germany (57.4 CO2-e q), \nSpain (56.6), United Kingdom (54.1) and Italy (45.9). These \nfive largest emitters of agricultural GHG account for 60 \npercent of the EU total of the agricultural sector.\nBecause  of  differences  in  the  agricultural  structure \namong EU countries, also the GHG sources differ in their \nimportance. In 2008, whereas in France agricultural soils \nand rice production account for 50.2 percent respec-\ntively 0.1 percent (UNFCCC 2011c) of the domestic ag-\nricultural GHG emissions, in Italy agricultural soils emit \n46.8 percent and rice production 3.9 percent (UNFCCC \n2011e)  of  the  domestic  agricultural  GHG.  Agricultural \nsoils account for 62.6 percent to the German agricultural \nGHG emissions (UNFCCC 2011d) with a significant release \nof CO2 and nitrous oxide from cultivated organic (peat) \nsoils. These cultivated organic soils play an important \nrole even if compared to total and not only agricultural \nemissions, as they account for ca. 4 percent of the total \nGHG emissions in Germany (Flessa 2010).\nIn  the  following  paragraphs,  we  describe  the  Euro-\npean Union\u2019s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and its \nplanned reforms, with a focus on its considerations with \nregard to climate change, and we critically assess the \nimplications  of  the  CAP  concerning  the  contribution \nof European agriculture to climate change and climate \nchange mitigation.\n8.1.2 The EU CAP\nThe CAP, with a yearly budget of about 50 billion Euro, \nwhich is about 40-50 percent of the total EU budget, \nis  the  most  important  policy  framework  with  strong \ninfluence  on  land  use  management  across  the  EU.  It \nhas therefore a large potential to influence the scale to \nwhich European agriculture delivers public goods, such \nas a contribution to climate change mitigation (Cooper \net al. 2009).\nCurrently, the CAP is broadly structured in two \u201cpillars\u201d \nof polices (see Figure 7). The first pillar, accounting for \n75  percent  of  all  EU  agricultural  payments,  consists \nin  annual  direct  payments  and  market  measures,  viz. \nsubsidies, to farmers. The second, smaller pillar covers \n  multi-annual  measures  for  \u201crural  development\u201d.  This \nsecond pillar is organised along three axes. Two of those \ncan also be seen as subsidies to improve competitive-\nness on sectoral and territorial level, while one is target-\ned at payments for public goods of mainly environmen-\ntal character. The agricultural expenditure is financed by \ntwo funds, the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund \nfor pillar 1 and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural \nDevelopment for pillar 2.\nThe initial objectives of the CAP at the time of its crea-\ntion in 1957 were mainly economical, with some social \naspects: 1) to increase agricultural productivity; 2) to en-\nsure a fair standard of living for the agricultural commu-\nnity; 3) to stabilise markets; 4) to assure the availability of \nsupplies and 5) to ensure that supplies reach consumers \nat reasonable prices (EEC, 25 March 1957, article 39). \nDuring the last decades, the CAP has undergone several \nreforms, and today its targets differ significantly from \nthe original ones mentioned above. Environment-relat-\ned issues such as resource depletion, biodiversity, and \nclimate change have been increasingly considered. The \nlast reform was the so-called \u201cHealth Check\u201d (EC Agricul-\nture and Rural Development 2010), implemented from \n2009 onwards, based on the rapid international develop-47\nFigure 7:  The structure of the CAP with budget numbers as of 2009\nments since the reform in 2003, in the context of the \nfi  nancial crisis and increasingly volatile agricultural prices \nand costs. The current policy framework of the CAP is \nconfi  rmed until 2013. Negotiations on a fundamental \nreform of the CAP potentially affecting the details of all \nfunding institutions for the next EU budget period from \n2013 onwards are currently under way and several policy \ndocuments in preparation of legislative proposals of the \npost-2013  CAP  have  recently  been  published  (Bureau \nand Mah\u00e9 2008; Adinolfi   et al. 2010; EC Climate Action \n2010) (see also the web resources: Capreform 2010; IEEP \n2010; Reform the CAP 2010a). As this section was writ-\nten before the Resolution of the European Parliament \n(EP 2011) as well as the legislative proposals made by \nthe European Commission (EC 2011b), these are not re-\nfl  ected in the following analysis.\nMost important in this process is the European Parlia-\nment Resolution of 8 July 2010 (EP 2010b) and the Euro-\npean Commission Communication from November 18 \n2010 (EC 2010b). The EP Resolution dedicates a section \nto the challenges to which the post-2013 CAP must re-\nspond (Paragraphs 10 to 20). It highlights, among other \nissues, the importance of climate change (Paragraphs 13 \nand 14). The EP Resolution also defi  nes the new CAP pri-\norities for the 21st century in line with the new EU 2020 \nStrategy (Paragraphs 37, 48): It is stated that agriculture \nis well placed to make a major contribution to tackling \nclimate change (EP 2010b). The EC (2010b) names cli-\nmate change and environmental challenges as one of \nthree  key  challenges  in  agriculture,  the  others  being \nfood security and territorial imbalances, and it describes \nthree  corresponding  main  objectives  for  a  post-2013 \nCAP. These statements are based on a range of recent \noffi  cial EC and EP documents that specifi  cally address \nclimate change mitigation and adaptation in European \nagriculture and on the global IAASTD report emphasizing \nthe crucial and pressing importance to address climate \nchange in agricultural policy (Bureau and Mah\u00e9 2008; EC \n2009a, b; IAASTD 2009; EP 2010a). Three options are pro-\nposed for the post-2013 CAP in the EC communication \nwhich were also subject to public consultation on the \nReform the CAP 2010b\nPillar 1\n(total 39.5 Billion Euro)\nPillar 2\n(total 7.7 Billion Euro)\nDirect income \nsupport: \n31.3 Billion Euro\nCoupled subsidies: \n4.8 Billion Euro\nMarket support:\n3.4 Billion Euro\nFirst Axis \u2013 improve competitiveness:\n2.6 Billion Euro\nSecond Axis \u2013 agri-environmental measures:\n4.7 Billion Euro\nThird Axis \u2013 rural livelihood:\n0.4 Billion Euro48\nCAP impact assessment (EC 2010b). These options were \nchosen to reflect the main directions of ongoing de-\nbates. The three options will have to be evaluated with \nregard to economic, environmental and social impacts \nbefore being considered for the basis of the legislative \nproposals on funding instruments in 2011.\nOption 1 would consist in gradual adjustments only to \nthe current CAP. Option 2 is a balanced CAP reform in-\ncreasing spending efficiency and effectiveness and mak-\ning the CAP more sustainable. Option 3 breaks up with \nthe current CAP philosophy and adopts a strong focus \non  rural  development  and  agri-environmental  public \ngoods. Those options are however not further specified \nand complemented with concrete suggestions for im-\nplementation (Adinolfi et al. 2010). Finally, simplification \nof the CAP is also a general aim of the reform. Formal \nlegislative proposals for the post-2013 CAP are expected \nfor mid-2011 or September 2011.\n8.1.3 Financial Subsidies and non-financial \nsupport measures and the CAP \nFinancial subsidies and non-financial support measures \nare both powerful instruments through which the CAP \ninfluences European agriculture and land-use. They are \nalso the most controversial instruments: Hailed by the \nEuropean Commission as essential to ensure the eco-\nnomic  viability  of  European  farmers,  and  reward  the \nprovision of public goods, subsidies are strongly criti-\ncised by many NGOs and other stakeholders for being \ninefficient, distorting and ineffective (Jambor and Har-\nvey 2010; Reform the CAP 2010a). Major reforms or even \ntotal abolishment of subsidies is seen as one of the most \nimportant issues for the reformed post-2013 CAP. The \nEC acknowledges the need to shift subsidies such that \n\u201c[\u2026] the future CAP should contain a greener \nand more equitably distributed first pillar and \na second pillar focussing more on competi-\ntiveness and innovation, climate change and \nthe environment.\u201d (EC 2010b, p.3)\nSubsidies under the first pillar are a) direct income pay-\nments that reward farmers based on historic support \nentitlements via single farm and area payments, b) cou-\npled subsidies to increase and support the production \nof certain specific goods via production premiums and \narea payments, and c) market interventions to raise and \nstabilize prices via intervention buying and export sub-\nsidies. Direct income support is largest with 31.3 billion \nEuro in 2009, coupled subsidies were at 4.8 billion and \nmarket support at 3.4 billion. Parts of pillar two meas-\nures also count as subsidies. Those are the payments \nunder the first axis, that aim at improving the competi-\ntiveness of agriculture and forestry via modernization, \ninfrastructure provision and adding value to products \n(2.6 billion), and of the third axis, aiming at improving \nlivelihood in rural areas via village renewal, basic service \nprovision and business development (0.4 billion; Source: \nReform the CAP 2010b).\nSince 2005, direct payments are subjected to fulfilment \nof compulsory requirements, the so-called cross com-\npliance requirements. Those are based on 18 standards, \nreferring  to  environmental,  public,  animal  and  plant \nhealth, and animal welfare aspects (EC 2003, article 3 \nand 4, Annex III). None of those criteria is linked to cli-\nmate change mitigation, though, but this is now ad-\ndressed in the CAP reform process, see below. In addi-\ntion, member states shall ensure that agricultural land \nis \u201cmaintained in good agricultural and environmental \ncondition\u201d (article 5), according to the standards set out \nin Annex IV. These standards aim at reducing soil ero-\nsion, maintaining soil organic matter and soil structure, \nand avoiding deterioration of habitats. Due to the focus \non soil organic matter, these standards are of some cli-\nmate relevance. \nDespite  recent  reforms,  such  as  the  abolishment  of \nsupport for livestock on a per head basis, thus reducing \nincentives to increase and maintain high livestock num-\nbers, or a decoupling of direct payments from specific \nproduction under the \u201cHealth Check\u201d, climate change \nmitigation plays almost no role under the current CAP \npillar one measures. The situation is somewhat better \nfor rural development under pillar two. There, several \nmeasures have a clear mitigation benefit, although they \nwere not aimed at mitigation in the first place (EC 2009a). \nFarm modernisation support (Axis 1) can, for example, 49\nimprove the efficiency of energy use and fertilizer ap-\nplication, and manure management. Also possible under \nfarm modernization is support for renewable biomass \nenergy and local biogas production in particular. Under \nAxis  2,  payments  for  improved  soil  management  and \nfertiliser  application  are  available,  thus  increasing  soil \ncarbon sequestration and reducing nitrous oxide emis-\nsions from soils. Providing training and advisory services \nfor climate friendly agricultural practices is another op-\ntion for improvement. \nSome of these measures are programmed for some na-\ntional Rural Development Plans for 2007-13 (EC 2009a, \np. 44-45). Nevertheless, climate change mitigation is not \nyet a specific target under the CAP and implementation \nof measures to support mitigation and the choice of ad-\nequate policy instruments remains at the discretion of \nthe member countries. The whole discussion on those \nthen also remains somewhat hypothetical or optional, \nas reflected in the document EC (2009a), Annex 2, for \nexample.\n8.1.4 Public Good Provision\nPayments for the provision of public goods are an im-\nportant aspect of the CAP. They are provided via the agri-\nenvironmental measures under pillar 2 (Axis 2). In 2009, \n4.7 billion Euro were allocated to this axis (Reform the \nCAP 2010b). Typical public goods provided by agriculture \nare related to environmental quality, such as biodiversity, \nwater quality, water availability, soil functionality, air qual-\nity, resilience to flooding and fire and climate change \nmitigation (greenhouse gas emissions, carbon storage) \n(Cooper et al. 2009). Public good provision may play a \nmuch more important role in a reformed post-2013 CAP \nwith  a  particular  focus  on  climate  change  mitigation \n(Jambor and Harvey 2010). Most notably, there are the \nagri-environmental  measures  under  pillar  two  (Axis  2) \nthat have the potential to support environmental public \ngood provision. \nWhile  such  public  good  provision  may  have  slowed \ndown environmental degradation, there is evidence of \nundersupply of most key environmental public goods in \nagriculture (Cooper et al. 2009). Current levels of spend-\ning on environmental public goods are insufficient to \nmeet societal demands and EU targets. The undersup-\nply of agricultural public goods is due to the low im-\nportance of environmental aspects in the CAP. There are \nalso trade-offs between general goals and policies for \nincreased efficiency and productivity in agriculture and \nenvironmental goals and corresponding policies. \nMany farming systems and practices have considerable \npotential to provide public goods. For climate change \nmitigation services, most important practices are those \nthat increase soil organic matter, such as use of organic \nfertilizers, reduced tillage, and optimized crop rotations, \nand those that reduce soil nitrous oxide emissions, i.e. \npractices with reduced external nitrogen inputs. Meth-\nane reduction in the livestock sector can primarily be \nachieved by improved manure management and a re-\nduction in the number of animals (e.g. Smith et al. 2008; \nEC 2009a). \nIt is important to note that reduction of methane emis-\nsions from ruminants by feed additives is controversial, \ndue to adverse effects on animal welfare, and that the \nrelatively lower emissions from concentrate feed than \nfor roughage have to be evaluated in relation to the \nhigher  emissions  from  concentrate  feed  production, \nin particular if deforestation in the south is involved. It \nmust also be noted that many agri-environmental pro-\ngrammes like the support for organic farming depend \nstrongly on regional policies and budgets as such pro-\ngrammes are subjected to 50 percent co-financing by \nthe EU Member States, i.e. their region. That means no \nfunding  of  such  agri-environmental  is  possible  if  the \nMember State does not want to or cannot contribute a \nsufficient share.\nIn principle, supporting these mitigation practices under \nthe CAP would be possible and has in part already been \ndone (Cooper et al. 2009; EC 2009a), and some aspects \nare a recurrent topic (e.g. maintaining soil organic mat-\nter and soil structure), but a much stronger emphasis \non this topic is needed to achieve any significant results. \nEven,  some  adverse  development  can  be  seen.  The \n\u201cHealth Check\u201d from 2009, for example, abolished the \nrequirement for 10 percent set-aside land. This is done 50\nwith the aim to allow farmers maximise their produc-\ntive potential, but it will lead to soil carbon losses when \nchanging from set-aside fallows to crop production. \nAt the same time, direct premiums for energy crop pro-\nduction were abolished as well. This will likely have a neg-\native effect on energy crop production but it increases \nefficiency of the combined food/energy crop produc-\ntion as a distorting measure is abolished. Compared to \nthe three options proposed for the post-2013 CAP (cf. \nabove),  achieving  significant  mitigation  by  measures \nfrom the CAP would require a fundamental shift such as \nproposed by the third option mentioned previously.\n8.1.5 Relation to EU climate policies \nUnder the Kyoto Protocol, the EU-15 has agreed to re-\nduce GHG emissions by 2012 by 8 percent compared to \n1990 levels. In 2008, total emissions of the EU-15 were \n6.5 percent below 1990 levels and for the whole EU-27, \nthey were 11.3 percent below 1990 levels. The agricul-\ntural sector contributed about 10 percent to the total \nemissions of the EU-27 in 2008 (11 percent in 1990), ex-\ncluding emissions and sequestration from land use, land \nuse change and forestry (LULUCF). LULUCF sequestered \n8.3 percent of the total EU-27 emissions in 2008 (6.2 \npercent in 1990) (EEA 2010). We also note that emissions \nfrom  fertilizer,  pesticides  and  animal  feed  production \nand fossil energy use in farming machinery, equipment \nand buildings are not covered under \u201cagricultural sector \nemissions\u201d. \nOver the last two decades (1990-2008), agricultural sec-\ntor  emissions  in  the  EU-27  fell  by  about  20  percent, \nmainly due to a reduction in the livestock numbers (by \n25 percent), more efficient fertilizer application (a de-\ncrease of 25 percent in fertiliser use) and due to im-\nproved manure management (EC 2009a). These reduc-\ntions were partly due to CAP reforms, e.g. the shift from \nproduction based support to area payments or the rule \nfor set-aside land in force until 2009, but other policies \nsuch as the Nitrates Directive were equally important (EC \n2009a). Identification of the detailed mitigation contri-\nbution of specific policies and market developments is \nrarely possible. \nCurrent  expectations  for  future  emission  reductions \nfrom agriculture in the EU 27 are almost nil with respect \nto today (about -1 percent by 2020; EEA 2009). Expected \nreductions for the EU 15 by 2020 are -4 percent. In any \ncase, those expectations are the lowest among all sec-\ntors. According to the \u201cEffort Sharing Decision\u201d of EU \nclimate policy, the sectors not covered by the EU Emis-\nsion  Trading  Scheme  (transport,  buildings,  agriculture \nand waste; cf. below) need to reduce about 10 percent \nby 2020 (EC Climate Action 2010a). This percentage was \ndefined as the sector`s contribution to the EU`s present \ncommitment to reduce overall emissions by 20 percent \nto 2020. According to recent negotiations, this target \nmight be raised to 30 percent (EP 2010c). \nTo stabilise global warming below two degrees, reduc-\ntion  targets  of  80-95  percent  by  2050  for  developed \ncountries  are  needed  (Allen  et  al.  2009;  Meinshausen \net al. 2009). All this illustrates that enhanced action on \nmitigation in agriculture is needed and that agriculture \nwill have to achieve even larger emission reductions in \nthe future. This is, however, not necessarily reflected in \npolicy proposals. The EU Roadmap 2050, for example (EC \n2011a), which aims at emission reductions of 80 percent \nby  2050,  foresees  no  dramatic  change  in  agricultural \nemissions. Agriculture is thus projected to be the single \nmost emitting sector in 2050, accounting for about a \nthird of total EU emissions.\nThe  EU  has  many  policies  addressing  climate  change. \nSince  2000,  most  important  is  the  European  Climate \nChange  Programme  (ECCP),  which  identifies  and  de-\nvelops  all  the  measures  necessary  to  implement  the \nKyoto Protocol. It entered a second phase in 2005. The \nECCP provides an EU-wide comprehensive package of \nmitigation policy measures, which is complemented by \nnational policies that also build on the ECCP (EC Climate \nAction 2010b). However, agriculture plays a minor role in \nclimate policy only. \nAlthough the mitigation potential of agriculture and soil \ncarbon sequestration in particular has been assessed by \nspecific working groups under ECCP (ECCP 2001, 2003, \n2006), no specific climate policies for agriculture were \nderived from that (see section 7 on UNFCCC policies). 51\nA directive on soil has been proposed in 2006, but the \ndecision-making process has been blocked since 2007 \n(EC Environment 2010). Such a directive has to explicitly \naddress and support the mitigation potential of soil car-\nbon sequestration, which is not the case in the current \nproposal (EC 2006). \nThus, agriculture is still not part of EU climate policy. In-\nclusion of agriculture in the third phase (2013-2020) of \nthe most prominent EU-wide mitigation policy, the EU \nEmissions Trading Scheme EU-ETS, has been discussed, \nbut the uncertainties regarding measurement and veri-\nfication of mitigation in agriculture lead to the decision \nagainst its inclusion (EC 2008, 2009c). \nIn contrast, inclusion of agriculture in the EU-ETS is seen \nas a promising option by some stakeholders, as it would \nput  a  price  on  the  mitigation  potential  in  agriculture \nwith  corresponding  effects  on  incentives  to  provide \nsuch mitigation (e.g. Reform the CAP 2010c). According \nto a recent literature review on the CAP reform, most \nauthors, however, do not discuss concrete policy meas-\nures  for  mitigation  in  agriculture  besides  the  general \nsuggestion of putting a price on carbon (Jambor and \nHarvey 2010).\nA large mitigation potential is seen in measures linked \nto land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF). Soil \ncarbon sequestration in cropland (e.g. via use of organic \nfertilizers and reduced tillage) and pastures and in or-\nganic soils (reduced use and restoration of peatlands) is \nan important part (EC 2009a). 90 percent of the mitiga-\ntion potential in global agriculture lies in LULUCF, namely \nin soil carbon sequestration (this share is assumingly of \na roughly comparable size in the EU, e.g. judged on the \nbasis of Freibauer et al. 2004 and the Roadmap 2050, EC \n2011a). LULUCF is however not part of mitigation com-\nmitments of the EU and it is only marginally covered in \nthe CAP. Forestry covers almost as much land as agricul-\nture in the EU. Despite this, only 1 percent of the CAP \nbudget is dedicated to forests (CEPF 2010). To overcome \nthis situation of neglect, the European Commission has \nto assess ways to include emissions and sinks from LU-\nLUCF  in  the  community  reduction  commitments  by \nmid-2011 (EP 2009).\n8.1.6 Concluding remarks \nAlthough  mitigation  increasingly  gains  importance  in \nthe CAP and plays an important role in the discussion on \nthe post-2013 CAP reform, much remains to be done to \nachieve significant mitigation results in agriculture, es-\npecially considering the additional emission reductions \nthe EU will have to achieve in the coming years to con-\ntribute reaching the 2\u00b0C goal. \nFirst, targeted measures should be taken to support the \nmost effective mitigation actions. This could be achieved \nby strengthening the payments for public good provi-\nsion resp. by tying direct payments via mitigation aspects \nin the cross compliance. For this, cross compliance cri-\nteria need to be changed to also account for mitigation. \nA thorough reform of the CAP that changes its current \nform is needed (i.e. option 3 of the reform).\nMost relevant are various measures for increasing soil \ncarbon  sequestration,  sustainable  peatland  manage-\nment,  forestry  management,  optimized  fertilizer  use \nand an optimized livestock sector. In particular meas-\nures to address the latter have to be assessed in a glo-\nbal context, as the production emissions of imported \nconcentrate feed and consumer behaviour need to be \ntaken into account. Eating less meat and other animal \nproducts, resp. the corresponding reduction of livestock \nnumbers is a most effective mitigation measure.\nSecond, harmonization of mitigation aspects in the CAP \nand of coverage of agriculture in climate policy, in par-\nticular regarding LULUCF, is of primary importance. The \nrelevance of LULUCF is acknowledged in both the CAP \nand climate policy, but in both, LULUCF is only margin-\nally addressed. The discussion on full inclusion in both is, \nhowever, ongoing.\nFinally,  mitigation  is  only  one  aspect  of  a  sustainable \nagriculture.  While  strengthening  mitigation  policy,  ac-\ncounting for adaptation and other co-benefits of agri-\nculture is of crucial importance. \nThe CAP has a broader coverage with regard to these \ntopics than climate policy and in the course of harmo-52\nnization, a balanced mix must be achieved. This means, \nfor  example,  that  monetary  incentives  must  not  be \ngiven primarily for most effective mitigation measures \nonly,  but  also  for  the  most  important  adaptation  ac-\ntivities.  Given  the  globalized  agricultural  markets,  this \nshould also be reflected by complementing the five ob-\njectives of the CAP as referenced above with a sixth one, \nfocusing on global responsibility, such as suggested in \nAPRODEV (2011), for example.

It \noccupies  about  11  percent  of  the  world\u00b4s  cultivated \nland. India and China together account for more than \n50 percent of the world rice production of about 300 \nmillion t per year. Rice is used as staple food and is the \nfirst cultivated crop in Asia at least the last 10,000 years. \nPerhaps even today there is no food as widely eaten as \nrice. It is estimated that about 3 billion people are de-\npendent on rice for their daily consumption, about 1 \nbillion of the poorest people of the world included. And \npresently about 960 Million people do not have enough \nmeans to sustain themselves with sufficient food on a \ndaily basis. The majority of these people do live in coun-\ntries where rice is the daily staple food (Wassmann et al. \n2000a-c; Zhang et al. 2010).\nAbout 160,000 rice varieties are still existing (Wassmann \net al. 2000). These varieties derive from originally two \nspecies of rice: Oryza sativa in the Indo-Chinese region \nand Oryza glaberrima in the African region. The breed-\ning of rice varieties just under the aspect of quality and \nquantity is neglecting the aspects of multiresistance and \nstress tolerance highly needed for adaptation processes \ndue to climate change. \nIt is further well established that rice production con-\ntributes to climate change. While this contribution can \nbe rather substantial on a national scale, on a global scale \nit is still a minor contribution compared to the contribu-\ntions of the industrialized nations.\nAs a general rule, with every 75 ppm increase in carbon \ndioxide concentration, rice yield might increase by 0.5 \nt/ha but yield will decrease by 0.6 t/ha for every 1\u00b0C in-\ncrease in temperature particularly through higher respi-\nration losses and sterilization processes. The decrease in \nrice production in Indonesia by 2025 could then reach \n1.8 Mio t annually (Anonyma 2010). But the projected \ndecrease in rice production due to agricultural land con-\nversion is much greater than the decrease due to in-\ncreasing temperatures (Boer et al. 2008, Mitra et al. 2005, \nOrtiz-Manasterio et al. 2010, Wassmann et al. 2004).\nAll the presently used rice strains do flower at the same \ntime of the day between10-12 o\u2019clock in the morning. \nThey are then extremely sensitive to heat impact. Fur-\nther, a month delay in wet season onset due to El Nino \nevents would decrease wet season rice production by \napproximately  65  percent  for  West  and  Central  Java \n(Naylor et al. 2007).\n8.2.2 Specific situation in Indonesia and \nIndonesia\u2019s national agricultural policies \naddressing climate change\nIndonesia is the largest archipelagic state of the world \nwith a landmass of about 1,919,270 km\u00b2 encircled by \nabout 3.3 million km\u00b2 of territorial seas (Rigg 1996). It \nhas  five  large  islands  (Kalimantan,  Sumatra,  Java,  Su-\nlawesi and West Papua) and about 17,503 small islands, 7 \npercent permanently inhabited. Of the about 20 million \nha of arable land about 40 percent are wetlands, mainly \npaddies,  about  40  percent  are  dryland  and  about  15 \npercent is under shifting cultivation. The archipelago is \npart of the monsunal regime and is experiencing the so-\ncalled El Nino-Southern Oscillation impacts with some-\ntimes torrential rains followed by extended dry spells.\nBased on the occurrence of disasters recorded in the \nInternational Disaster Database (in Anonyma 2007), the 53\nten biggest disaster events in Indonesia over the peri-\nod 1907-2007 occurred after 1990 and most of these \nare  weather  -related.  The  number  of  deaths  because \nof  climate-related  disasters  has  increased  50  percent \nper decade in Indonesia. Economic losses from these \nten biggest disasters are estimated with 26 billion US$ \n(Anonyma 2007).\nThe signals are well understood by the Indonesian Gov-\nernment as expressed in the National Action Plan (NAP) \n(Anonyma 2007): The Indonesian Government does real-\nize that economic management without consideration \nof its social and ecological implications contributes to \nthe loss of human safety and social security. The na-\ntional action plan addressing climate change, issued by \nthe Ministry of Environment, is in effect since November \n2007 (Anonyma 2007). This plan has been followed by \nthe Second National Communication under the United \nNation Framework Convention on Climate Change (UN-\nFCCC) (Anonyma 2010). \nThe Indonesian Government stresses the following fields \nof action and placed the respective actions and con-\nsiderations high on their agenda in relation to climate \nchange issues:\nAgricultural land conversion to non-agricultural land    z\nresults in a development of public activities that do \nnot have a community economic historical base, and \nthis has apparently accelerated ecological damage on \na national and global scale.\nThe availability of water, for various needs of the do-   z\nmestic settlement sector, agriculture, fisheries, animal \nhusbandry, industry and environment is very depend-\nent on the climate. The supply of clean water through \nthe piping system only covers about 37 percent of \nthe urban population and about 8 percent of the rural \npopu-lation. The number of critical water catchment \nareas has increased in recent years due to forest clear-\nings, inappropriate land management practices and \npollution. None of the Indonesian Rivers satisfy the \nfirst or second class of quality standard.\nThe management of the economic performance and    z\nquality of life is linked to the reduction of GHG emis-\nsions and the reduction of energy consumption.\nThe adaptation to climate change is a key aspect of the \nnational development agenda, just as effective climate \nchange  mitigation  and  the  development  of  a  system \nthat is resilient to long-term climate change impacts. The \nimplementation of adaptation activity should be parallel \nwith poverty alleviation efforts and economic develop-\nment targets for poor communities, which are the group \nmost vulnerable to the impact of climate change. \nFigure 8:  Emission contributions in Indonesia by sectors in 2000\nAfter Anonyma 2010\nLand use change \nand forestry \n47%\nPeat fire \n13%\nWaste \n11%\nEnergy \n20%\nIndustry \n3%\nAgriculture \n5%54\nIn 2005 the total GHG emission in Indonesia for the three \nmain greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, ni-\ntrouse oxide) was estimated with 2.3 Gt CO2e (1 Gt = 1 \nbillion t). The main contributing sectors were land use \nchange and forestry followed by energy, peat-fire-relat-\ned emissions, waste, agriculture and industry (Anonyma \n2010; www.unfccc.int/ghg_data/ghg_data_unfccc/time \n_series_ annex_i/tems/3814.php) (Figure 8). This makes \nIndonesia the third largest GHG emitter of the world af-\nter the USA and China. \nGHG emissions in Indonesia are expected to grow by 2 \npercent annually reaching about 2.8 Gt CO2e in 2020 and \n3.6 Gt CO2e in 2030 under business-as-usual (BAU) condi-\ntions. \nThe total area of paddies in Indonesia is given with about \n8 million ha. The monitoring of rice cultivation between \n1993 to 2002 revealed that 190,000 t of dried grain were \nlost due to drought and 177,000 t by flooding. Further, \ndifferent rice cultivars do have different root and above \nground biomass besides different yields/ha. The cultivar \nCisadane for example, used in Central Java, is the reason \nfor much more methane (CH4) emissions with poten-\ntially up to 142 kg per ha than other cultivars like Mem-\nberamo, Way Apo Buru or IR 64 (Setyanto et al. 2009).\nThe total emissions from the agricultural sector are cal-\nculated with 139 Mt CO2e in 2005. The methane emis-\nsions from Indonesian paddies in 2005 are given with   \n51.4  Mt  CO2e    (Anonyma    2010;  http://forestclimatecenter. \norg/files/2009-08-27%20Fact%20Sheet%20-% \n20Indonesia%20Greenhouse%20Gas%20Emission \n%20Cost%20Curve%20by%20Indonesia%20 \nNational%20Council%20on%20Climate%20Change.pdf) \n(Figure 9).\nThe reduction of 3.1 percent in 2004 can be attributed \nto an El Nino event during that year (Anonyma 2010).\nUnder  the  assumption  that  all  paddies  are  continu-\nously flooded and inorganic fertilizer is applied, e.g. for \nthe Cisadane variety of rice, it is expected that meth-\nane emissions in 2030 would be about 38,804 Mt CO2e \n(Anonyma 2010).\nAnticipated fields of actions addressed in the In-\ndonesian National Action Plan concerning Climate \nChange \nThe Indonesian Government stresses in its National Ac-\ntion Plan (NAP) the following fields of action and atten-\ntion (Anonyma 2007): \nFigure 9:  Estimation of Methane emissions from rice cultivation in Indonesia from 2000-2005\nAfter Anonyma 2010\n2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005\n1,800\n1,750\n1,700\n1,650\n1,600\n1,550\n1,500\nGgCH\n455\nThe utilization of environmental friendly organic fer-   z\ntilizer and pesticides and efficient machinery needs \nto be encouraged.\nThe  regulation  of  the  height  of  the  water  puddle,    z\nminimal land processing (TOT), direct seed spreading \n(TABELA) and integrated plant management (TPT) is \nmentioned.\nThe  System  of  Rice  Intensification  (SRI),  based  on    z\nfindings that the sitting of the seedlings in the seed-\nlings-bed can be reduced to just one week instead \nof about four weeks and therefore the entire water-\nlogged period in the paddy can be reduced by about \n3-4 weeks, is also recognized.\nThe rehabilitation of the irrigation network for pad-   z\ndies is a part of the planned activities.\nAn  institutional  improvement  is  planned  by  forming \nworking groups for climate change, flood and drought \ndisaster, water consumption and weather forecasts, be-\nsides advocacy and socialization to establish the right \nunderstanding to climate change and its impacts on the \nagricultural sector. \nAlso the necessity of food diversification, agriculture de-\nvelopment policies with considerations on eco-systems, \nreduction of emissions of GHG\u00b4s on all levels and avoid-\nance of pollution is clearly seen and in the focus of at-\ntention. The integration of sustainable environment and \nnatural resources issues and climate change issues into \nthe national curricula are also part of the NAP.\nThe following actions are planned and underway since \nthe issue of the National Action Plan in 2007 and several \ninitiatives to integrate mitigation and adaptation to cli-\nmate change issues into the national development plan-\nning agenda are actively persuaded. \nThe required instruments with their institutional sup-\nport of the NAP are on their way to be institutionalized \naccording to the commitment made by the Indonesian \nGovernment at the COP 15 Meeting in Copenhagen to \nreduce the carbon emissions by 26 percent from the \npresent Business-As-Usual (BAU) situation reaching a re-\nduction of about 41 percent of GHG or about 1.2 Gt CO2e \nby 2020 (Anonyma 2010) .\nA financing management system for supporting and ac-\ncelerating the implementation of climate change pro-\ngrams called the Indonesian Climate Change Trust Fund \n(ICCTF) is operational since 2009. At the initial phase, the \nICCTF will be dominated by public funding and at a later \nstage will draw predominantly on private funds (Anony-\nma 2010) (Figure 10). \nUntil the end of the first commitment period of the \nKyoto Protocol in 2012, the implementation of NAP in \neach of the mitigation and adaptation priority sectors \nwill be measured. \nIt is understood that the reduction potential for GHG \nemissions lies mainly in the forestry, peatland and agri-\nculture sector. \nA total of about 2 Gt CO2-eq is anticipated in 2030 for \nall of Indonesia. It is expected that the forest sector will \nproduce about 850 Mt CO2-eq or 38 percent of the total \nexpected emissions by 2030. A reduction of about 1,100 \nMt CO2-eq  could  be  reached  by  halting  deforestation \nand forest degradation (REDD). Afforestation and refor-\nestation efforts could account for an additional 230 Mt \nCO2-eq. \nThrough appropriate peatland management a reduction \nof 700 Mt CO2-eq could be reached. \nThe agricultural sector contributed in 2005 about 139 Mt \nCO2-eq. Up to 63 percent could be avoided through im-\nproved water and nutrient management for rice cultiva-\ntion and restoration of degraded agricultural land (see: \nhttp://forestclimatecenter.org).\nAspects of politics concerning subsidies in \n  Indonesia\nDiscussions and demands for subsidies are playing al-\nways a very crucial role when it comes to decisions con-\ncerning mitigation of climate change impacts. Subsidies 56\nfor fertilizer, pesticides and seeds have always been a \npart  of  the  governmental  policies  for  rural  improve-\nments and support for the agro-business sector. \nHowever, offi  cially no special considerations are given by \nthe Indonesian Government to specifi  c subsidies for the \nagricultural sector under the aspects of climate change \nissues presently, but through cross sector funding dedi-\ncated specifi  cally for adaptation and mitigation of climate \nchange impacts, the needed funds could be made avail-\nable. It is admitted that due to limited funding capacities \nthrough the national budget the Government of Indo-\nnesia will try to create various funding schemes, from \ndomestic sources to bilateral and multilateral sources, \nincluding funding via REDD-related external compensa-\ntion funding (Anonyma 2010). \nA  fi  rst  sign  of  a  concrete  step  in  the  right  direction \ncan be seen in the reported action of the GOI (Jakarta \nPost,  January  2011,  http://www.thejakartapost.com/\nnews/2010/08/26/letter-the-failed-rice-field-project.\nhtml) to ban the further conversion of e.g. peatland to \nother land uses in Kalimantan and Sumatra. \nBut this came only after massive protests by local com-\nmunities and international organizations like the World \nBank and after having implemented the One Million Hec-\ntares Peatland Project in Central Kalimantan during the \nlast 10 years (so-called Mega Rice Project). \nIf the Central Government of Indonesia will adhere to \nits commitment to reduce carbon dioxide emissions \nup to 26 percent by the year 2020 about half of this \ntarget can be achieved just by re-adjusting this Mega \nRice Project.\nFor  some  further  concrete  policy  recommendations, \nsee section 9.3.2.\nFigure 10: Responsibilities and development of the Indonesian Climate Trust Fund (ICCTF) \nAfter BAPPENAS 2009\nPre-market\nResearch &\ndevelopment\nDemonstration\nMarket creation\nEarly\ndeployment\nCommercial\ndeployment\nMarket\npenetration\n2009\nPhase 1\nSectoral\nministries\nPhase 2\nSectoral ministries, local \ngovernments, privates, \nNGOs, universities\nPhase 3\nHarmonized public sector \ninvolvement (loan, refl  ow \nof transformation fund, \ncapital market etc.)\nICCTF\ninnovation fund\nICCTF\ntransformation fund\nPrivate investment Government funding\n2010 201257\n8.3  Meat, fodder and biomass \nproducers and Climate Change \u2013 Country \nCase Brazil \nBy J\u00f8rgen Olesen\n8.3.1 Introduction\nWith an area of 8.5 million km\u00b2, Brazil is the largest coun-\ntry in South America. It had 186 million inhabitants in \n2008  and  an  average  population  growth  rate  of  1.15 \npercent per year. Most of the population (85 percent) \nlives in urban centres. The GDP growth was 2.6 percent \nper year thus exceeding the population growth. \nHowever, a large proportion (30 million) of the popula-\ntion still live in poverty, and eradicating poverty, improv-\ning  health  care,  combating  hunger,  ensuring  housing \netc. is therefore a priority that ranks equal to environ-\nmental and climate change concerns (MCT 2010).\nBrazil is an emerging economy that in economic terms \nis ranked eighth in the world. It is to a large extent an \nindustrialised economy, but with a large agricultural sec-\ntor that has food exports as its main export commodity \n(about 35 percent of the country\u2019s exports). \nBrazil is the main global exporter of sugarcane, beef, \nchicken,  coffee,  orange  juice,  tobacco  and  alcohol,  it \ncomes  second  in  soybean  and  maize  exports,  and  it \nis ranked fourth in pork exports. Agriculture employs \nabout  one-quarter  of  the  labour  force.  However,  in \nterms of the total economy, agriculture only has a share \nof 5.5 percent. On a value basis, production is 60 percent \nfield crops and 40 percent livestock. \nIn 2005 the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from \nBrazil amounted to 2,189 million ton CO2-eq. (MCT 2010). \nThe major source of GHG emission is land use change \n(primarily deforestation) that contributed to 58 percent \nof total GHG emissions. Methane emissions from live-\nstock contributed to 11 percent of the total GHG emis-\nsions, and nitrous oxide emissions from agricultural use \nof fertilisers accounted for 7 percent of total GHG emis-\nsions.\n8.3.2 Land use and agriculture in Brazil\nBrazil  is  home  to  an  extremely  rich  flora  and  fauna, \nand it hosts over a third of the Earths tropical forests. \nIn addition to the rainforest in the Amazon basin, Brazil \nhas several other major ecosystems, such as savannah \nin the Cerrado as well as coastal wetlands. The climate \nof Brazil ranges from wet tropical in the rainforest over \nsemi-temperate in the south to very dry and warm in \nthe Northeast.\nBrazil has a very large agricultural area, which is located \nin different parts of the country. The southern half of \nthe country has a semi-temperate climate and adequate \n  rainfall,  good  soils,  access  to  technology  and  inputs \n(seeds, fertilisers, agrochemicals, etc.), adequate infra-\nstructure, and experienced large-scale farmers. It pro-\nduces most of Brazil\u2019s grains and oil seeds and export \ncrops. A more subsistence type of farming is located in \nthe drought-affected northeast region and in the Ama-\nzon basin, where rainfall is not well distributed, soils are \npoor, and infrastructure and capital for agricultural de-\nvelopment is lacking. \nHowever, the Amazon region is increasingly becoming \nimportant  as  a  source  of  exports  of  forest  products, \ncocoa, and tropical fruits. Central Brazil contains sub-\nstantial areas of savannah with trees covering 3 to 30 \npercent of the area (the Cerrado). The mixture of grass \nand deep-rooted trees provides good vegetation cover \nin both the wet and dry seasons. This area is increasingly \nbeing used for raising cattle and producing crops (e.g. \nsoybean) for exports. These new systems are less capa-\nble of utilising resources than the native ecosystem.\nBrazil\u2019s cattle and soybean production are concentrated \nin  the  Legal  Amazon  and  Cerrado  grasslands  regions, \nand have resulted in considerable biodiversity loss, de-\nforestation, water pollution and displacement of indig-\nenous peoples. In 2007, about 74 million cattle, or 40 \npercent of Brazil\u2019s herd, were living in the Legal Amazon. \nAlmost one million km\u00b2, or nearly half of the Cerrado, \nhave been burned and are now cattle pasture, or cul-\ntivated for soybeans, maize (both primary for livestock \nfeed), and   sugarcane for ethanol production. At least 58\none  quarter  of  Brazil\u2019s  grain  is  grown  in  the  Cerrado \nregion.  Eucalyptus  plantations  are  increasingly  being \nplanted  for  bioenergy  purposes,  often  with  negative \nimpacts on water availability due to the high water con-\nsumption of Eucalypt.\n8.3.3 Biofuel production\nBrazil  was  the  world\u2019s  second  largest  producer  (after \nUSA) of bioethanol in 2007 with a global share of 37 per-\ncent (Fischer et al. 2009). The country exported 3.5 bil-\nlion litres in 2007, 20 percent of Brazilian production, \nand about 50 percent of global ethanol exports. Where-\nas the ethanol production in USA is based on maize, in \nBrazil it is based on sugarcane. The supply of sugarcane \nin Brazil is mainly based on large farm mono-cropping \n(up to 100,000 ha), with intensive use of machines and \nagrochemicals (WWF 2006). \nFollowing  restrictive  environmental  legislation  in  the \n1990s, burning crops before harvest has been prohibited \nin the state of Sao Paulo, which accounts for the largest \nshare of Brazil\u2019s sugarcane production. The abolition of \npre-harvest field burning should have significant envi-\nronmental benefits, such as the elimination of air emis-\nsions and a reduced risk of forest fires (Pinto et al. 2003; \nGaldos et al. 2010). However, this clearly depends on the \nefficiency with which this is enforced. The effect on soil \ncarbon also depends on whether the leftover straw is \nharvested for energy purposes (e.g., incineration). There \nis no common practice of post-harvest burning of the \nstraw.\nIt has been estimated that the production of one ton of \nsugar results in emission of 241 kg CO2-eq., of which 44 \npercent results from residue burning, 20 percent from \nuse  of  synthetic  fertiliser  and  18  percent  from  fossil \nfuel use (Figueiredo et al. 2010). It is also the agricultural \nphase that dominates the GHG emissions from ethanol \nproduction (Galdos et al. 2010). It is particularly the burn-\ning of the crop residues that contributes to GHG emis-\nsions.\nSugarcane has expanded onto more degraded or poor \nareas  (mainly  previously  extensive  pastures).  It  con-\ntributes to soil recovery by adding organic matter and \nchemical-organic fertilizer, thus improving soil structure \nand making it possible to use it for agriculture again. \nSugarcane production in Brazil today causes relatively lit-\ntle soil loss through erosion. \nThis situation is improving as a result of the progres-\nsive increase in harvesting without straw burning and \nthe use of reduced soil-preparation techniques, leading \nto very low erosion losses compared to those obtained \nby direct plantation in annual crops. There may still be \nsome problems related to the use of agrochemicals in \nthe production. Since sugarcane is not irrigated in Brazil, \nenvironmental problems caused by irrigation to water \nquality, nutrients inflow and erosion are low.\nDirect biodiversity loss from suger-cane production is \ngenerally low, since sugarcane is largely cultivated on \ndegraded  or  poor  land,  and  mainly  on  \u201crecycled\u201d  ex-\ntensive pasture \u2013 but not extensively on new, unculti-\nvated land. There are, however, indirect negative effects \non biodiversity since the expansion of sugarcane onto \ngrasslands will be a driver for expansion of grasslands \nand cultivated soybean into forested areas in other re-\ngions  of  Brazil.  A  major  consequence  for  biodiversity \ncould happen if cultivation expanded to the Cerrado or \nforest land as a result of extreme demand for sugar and \nbioethanol (Kaltner et al. 2005). To maintain a sustainable \nbioethanol production in Brazil, sustainability standards \nor certified production will most probably be required \n(Smeets et al. 2008).\n8.3.4 Greenhouse gases from land use change\nIn many tropical countries, the majority of deforesta-\ntion results from the actions of poor subsistence cul-\ntivators. However, in the Amazon, these farmers con-\ntribute only to about 30 percent of deforestation, while \nthe majority (60-70 percent) of the deforestation can \nbe attributed to cattle ranches (Butler 2008). The direct \ncontribution  of  large-scale  farming  (i.e.  soybeans)  to \ntotal deforestation in the Amazon is currently relatively \nsmall. Most soybean cultivation takes place outside the \nrainforest in the neighbouring Cerrado ecosystem and \nin areas that have already been cleared. However, car-59\nbon emissions from cultivating the Cerrado can also be \nquite large.\nSoybean expansion is not the primary direct driver of \ndeforestation  of  rainforests  in  South  America  (Batlle-\nBayer et al. 2010). It is rather grasslands and savannahs \n(Cerrado that also has a large tree cover) that are con-\nverted to soy plantations, since these areas can readily \nbe used for growing soybean. As cattle farms and the \nland of some subsistence farmers are converted to soy-\nbean cultivation, cattle and subsistence farmers turn to \nforest clearing in order to obtain new land. In this sense \nsoybean expansion becomes the main indirect driver of \ndeforestation. Additionally, studies have shown a close \ncorrelation between logging and future clearing for set-\ntlement and farming. When land is cleared for cultiva-\ntion, charcoal producers remove the trees. \nThe rest of the vegetation is gathered into piles by trac-\ntors or bulldozers and burned. After clearing, the soil is \nploughed and prepared for sowing. The development of \nthe soybean area is largely driven by exports to Europe \nand other industrialized countries, where it is currently \nused as animal feed. In the future, though, soy oil could \nalso be extracted and processed into biodiesel, and this \nis already now being pushed by the national biodiesel \npolicy. This would further increase the area of soybean \nand increase the pressure on native vegetation.\nIn the agricultural frontier state of Mato Grosso crop-\nlands doubled from 2001 to 2006 to cover about 100,000 \nkm\n2, and new intensive double cropping systems occu-\npied more than 20 percent of croplands (Galford et al. \n2010a). \nDuring the period 1996-2005 there was a reported aver-\nage deforestation rate of 11,720 km\u00b2 per year, which, \nhowever, has declined to half this rate in recent years \n(Figure 11). This reduction is likely a response to govern-\nmental actions for reducing deforestation.\nDuring  land  clearing  carbon  is  lost  as  CO2  and  partly \nmethane by the slash and burn process. It can be as-\nsumed that about 1 percent of the carbon lost is emit-\nted as methane (Galford et al. 2010b). Since methane \nis a more potent greenhouse gas than CO2, its impor-\ntance for the GHG balance cannot be ignored. After the \nland clearing there are substantial losses of soil organic \ncarbon  (SOC).  However,  estimates  of  emissions  from \nchanges in SOC are quite variable, because of uncertain-\nFigure 11: Reported deforestation rates (bars) in the Amazon and levels of reduction (lines) proposed \nby the National Plan on Climate Change in reference to the 1996-2005 baseline\nRedrawn after Cerri et al. 2010, based on data from MCT 2010\n1\n9\n9\n0\n1\n9\n9\n1\n1\n9\n9\n2\n1\n9\n9\n3\n1\n9\n9\n4\n1\n9\n9\n5\n1\n9\n9\n6\n1\n9\n9\n7\n1\n9\n9\n8\n1\n9\n9\n9\n2\n0\n0\n0\n2\n0\n0\n1\n2\n0\n0\n1\n2\n0\n0\n3\n2\n0\n0\n4\n2\n0\n0\n5\n2\n0\n0\n6\n2\n0\n0\n7\n2\n0\n0\n8\n2\n0\n0\n9\n2\n0\n1\n0\n2\n0\n1\n1\n2\n0\n1\n2\n2\n0\n1\n3\n2\n0\n1\n4\n2\n0\n1\n5\n2\n0\n1\n6\n2\n0\n1\n7\n2\n0\n1\n8\n2\n0\n1\n9\n2\n0\n2\n0\n30,000\n25,000\n20,000\n15,000\n10,000\n5,000\nkm\n2\n1996-2005\nreference\n-40%\n-30%\n-30%\n-30%\n-80%60\nSource 1990 2005 Difference 1990-2005  \nin % of 1990 values\nAgriculture\n  Enteric fermentation in livestock (CH4) 184,9 248,4 34%\n  Manure storage and management (CH4, N2O) 13 16,1 24%\n  Rice cultivation (CH4) 5 5,4 8%\n  Field burning of crop residues (CH4, N2O) 4,4 4,6 5%\n  Agricultural soils and fertilisation (N2O) 132,1 192,9 46%\nTotal 339,4 467,4 38%\nLand use change and forestry\n  Forest and grassland conversion (CO2, CH4, N2O) 919,8 1074,2 17%\n  Emissions and removal from soils (CO2) 110,2 65,1 -41%\nTotal  1030 1139,3 11%\nSinks (change in biomass and land abandonment)\nTotal (CO2) -234,4 -230,2 -2%\nNet emissions (sources - sinks) 795,6 909,1 14%\nTable 4:  Emissions from agriculture and land use change and forestry, and sinks from land use \nchange and forestry expressed in million ton CO2 equivalents for 1990 and 2005, and the \nrelative change from 1990 to 2005, expressed in percentages of the 1990 values\nCerri et al. 2009\nties in estimated carbon stocks in the natural ecosys-\ntems, surveys on state of grassland conditions, and the \nmanagement data for grasslands and croplands (Maia et \nal. 2010a).\nThere are currently activities ongoing in Brazil for affor-\nestation and reforestation. The planted forests in Brazil \nwere estimated to cover 66,000 km\n2 in 2009 (Cerri et al. \n2010). More than two thirds of the planted forest are \nwith Eucalyptus species. The planted area with Eucalyp-\ntus has since 2004 shown an average annual increase of \n7.4 percent, whereas the area with other species was \nrather constant. These plantations are designed to de-\nliver high outputs of biomass for bioenergy. \nHowever, they will do little do deliver other ecosystem \ngoods and services, since these monocultures will not \nsupport biodiversity, and the Eucalyptus species gener-\nally have a high water consumption, which can threaten \nlocal water supply. In some cases Eucalyptus plantations \nwill also impact on small-scale farmers that loose access \nto their land, largely because of poor land entitlement.\n8.3.5 Greenhouse gases from agriculture\nAgriculture releases significant amounts of CO2, meth-\nane and nitrous oxide to the atmosphere (Cerri et al. \n2007). The expansion of agriculture in Brazil means that \nagricultural GHG emissions are also increasing, primarily \nfrom the livestock (Table 4). \nHowever,  the  emissions  from  agriculture  is  still  over-\nshadowed  by  emission  from  land  use  change,  which \nleads to the fact that agricultural soils are also a consid-\nerable source of CO2.\n8.3.6 Mitigation of agricultural emissions \nFor arable land the most important greenhouse gases \nare nitrous oxide and CO2 (Six et al. 2004), and manage-\nment practices highly affect the emissions. For livestock \nsystems major emissions stem from the methane from \nenteric  fermentation  and  from  methane  and  nitrous \noxide from manure management. These emissions can \nin general best be reduced by improving the efficiency 61\nof  the  entire  production  system  (Olesen  et  al.  2006), \nalthough there are also specific measures that can be \ntaken to further reduce emissions.\nBelow  is  a  list  of  particular  measures  that  have  been \nfound suitable in Brazil and for which evidence has been \nprovided for their applicability in Brazil. Some of these \nmeasures are best applied in large scale farming, e.g. \nno-tillage. However, other measures that involve agro-\necological techniques are equally well suited for small-\nholder  farming.  However,  in  many  cases  the  issue  of \nmaking  smallholders  more  climate-friendly  would  be \nthat of better empowering them in terms of knowledge \nand skills and in terms of access to necessary imple-\nments and finance. Some of these barriers can be over-\ncome  through  community-based  approaches  such  as \nestablishing water user associations (IWMI and SIC ICWC \n2003), community-based agricultural extension services \n(Coupe 2009) and organisation of micro credits. \nRestoration of degraded pastures\nGrassland management can greatly affect SOC contents, \nand a range of practices to improve SOC content in de-\ngraded grasslands have been proposed, including irri-\ngation, improved grazing, improved grass species and \nintroduction of legumes. Maia et al. (2009) compared \ntraditional  grassland  management  that  typically  leads \nto degradation with improved grassland management \ninvolving moderate grazing pressure combined with at \nleast one improvement such as fertilisation, lime, irri-\ngation, seeding legumes or planting more productive \ngrass species. They found that the improved pastures \nled to SOC increases of about 20 percent.\nElimination of field burning of crop residues\nField burning of residues is a major source of CO2 and \nmethane  emissions.  In  traditional  cropping  of  sugar \ncane, it was burnt a few days before harvesting in order \nto facilitate manual cutting by removing leaves and in-\nsects (Thorburn et al. 2001). \nHowever, since May 2000 this practice has been progres-\nsively prohibited by law in some areas of Brazil. In addi-\ntion to GHG emissions, other air pollutants are emitted \nduring  burning  causing  respiratory  problems  and  ash \nfall over urban areas. Even though the law will not be \nfully implemented before 2030, it has led to rapid adop-\ntion of mechanical harvesting, which also leads to more \nsoil organic matter accumulation. \nNo-tillage\nNo-tillage is an arable crop production system, where \nthe soil is left undisturbed from harvest to planting. This \ncauses less soil disturbance, which often results in sig-\nnificant accumulation of soil C (Carvalho et al. 2009; Bod-\ndey et al. 2010; Maia et al. 2010b). There is controversy \non the extent to which no-till really sequesters SOC, es-\npecially when the whole soil profile is considered (Baker \net al. 2007). \nThe quantity of residues returned, variations in practices \nimplemented and perhaps climate and soil type are likely \nto affect the soil carbon sequestation obtained. Results \nfrom no-tillage in Brazil have generally showed signifi-\ncant carbon accumulation in the top 30 cm of the soil \nprofile. This also has positive effects for soil fertility and \ncrop yields (Cerri et al. 2007). \nThe Brazilian Ministry of Environment has a goal of in-\ncreasing the extent of no-tillage from currently 28 mil-\nlion ha to 40 million ha in 2020 (Cerri et al. 2010). The \nadoption of no-tillage involves changes in farming prac-\ntices, which is coupled to changes in machinery, resi-\ndue management and often also changed systems of \nweed and pest control that for economic reasons often \ninvolve use of GMOs that enable simpler management \nschemes to be introduced, which lowers labour costs in \nlarge-scale farming systems.\nAgroforestry systems\nAgroforestry  systems  offer  possibilities  for  improving \nproductivity  and  sequestering  carbon  in  dry  environ-\nments by providing a better use of soil moisture. These \nsystems are particularly relevant in the dry regions of \nnorth-eastern Brazil, where rural poverty is widespread \n(Maia et al. 2007). Not all agroforestry systems are equal-62\nly efficient in delivering both climate change mitigation \nand increased productivity. Maia et al. (2007) found that \na silvo-pastoral system was the most favourable in terms \nof carbon sequestration. In this system trees provided \na 38 percent soil cover and the rest of the area was in \ngrazed grassland. \nRice cultivation\nRice is not a dominant crop in Brazil, but the emissions in \n2005 did amount to 5.4 million ton CO2-eq. Since about a \nthird of this rice cultivation is managed as permanently \nflooded rice there is a potential for reducing methane \nemissions by reducing the duration of the flooding pe-\nriod by using intermittent flooding systems.\nIntegrated crop and livestock systems\nRecently there has been a trend in parts of Brazil for \nconversion  of  pasture  and  agriculture  to  integrated \ncrop-livestock systems, where the grasslands are in ro-\ntation with the arable crops (Carvalho et al. 2010). This \nsystem has been found to be a sink of carbon that is \nlarger even than permanent pastures, perhaps due to \nmaintenance of a higher soil fertility.\nImproved manure management\nManure can be stored either wet (slurry) or dry (e.g. farm-\nyard manure). Methane emissions occur primarily when \nthe manure is stored in the liquid form. In contrast to \nthe global situation, most intensive livestock systems in \nBrazil apply drylot based manure management systems, \nwhich means that methane emissions may be relatively \nlow. On the other hand this could mean that nitrous ox-\nide emissions are high, although this would greatly de-\npend on the local environmental conditions. \nFor  the  future  development  of  livestock  systems  in \nBrazil there is a need to consider which manure man-\nagement  systems  are  put  into  place.  To  the  extent \nthat there is an increase in slurry-based systems, this \nshould be coupled with use of anaerobic digestion (bi-\nogas) to avoid increase in methane emissions (Cerri et \nal. 2010).\n8.3.7 Policies affecting agricultural greenhouse \ngas emissions\nAgricultural policy\nBrazil\u2019s agricultural sector has grown rapidly since gov-\nernment abandoned policies for import substitution (fa-\nvouring domestic production over competing imports, \ne.g.  high  import  tariffs),  and  recently  agriculture  has \nbeen largely liberalised. This has led to a large growth in \nproduction of the agricultural sector in Brazil, and much \nof this can be attributed to increased productivity and \nlower prices of imported inputs, and also to an increase \nin agricultural area.\nBrazil provides a relatively low level of government sub-\nsidy for agriculture. It amounted to about 6 percent of \nfarm income in 2005-07, compared to 12 percent in USA \nand 29 percent in the EU (Economist 2010). Producer \nsupport is supplied mostly through preferential credit \nto the sector (MAPA 2008). This support is justified to \noffset high market interest rates and to support income \ngeneration for the rural poor.\nThe agricultural policies are primarily directed towards \nimproving economic and social conditions in rural areas \nand in increasing the global competitiveness of the Bra-\nzilian agriculture. There are, however, two government \nprogrammes that are relevant for climate protection. \nThis concerns the Prolora programme that promotes \ncommercial  forestation,  forest  preservation  in  areas \nof legal reserve, and wood production for burning in \nthe drying of grains. It also concerns the Produsa pro-\ngramme that supports recovery of degraded soil and \npastures,  and  support  to  the  use  of  environmentally \nsound practices, in particular through providing fund-\ning for soil preservation, improvement of pastures and \nagroforestry.\nClimate and energy policies\nBrazil as an emerging economy so far has no reduction \ncommitments under UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol. \nDespite this, there is an array of programmes in Brazil \nto promote reduction in GHG emissions. Some of these 63\nprogrammes contribute to \u201cclean\u201d energy, while other \nmeasures are targeted at reducing deforestation (MCT \n2010).\nIn 1975 following the first oil crisis, the Brazilian gov-\nernment launched the National Ethanol Program (ProAl-\ncool), creating conditions for large-scale development \nof the ethanol industry based on sugar cane. This pro-\ngram was further developed in 1979 after the second oil \nshock by introducing a number of tax and financial in-\ncentives. The economic incentives for the industry was \nlargely dismantled during the late 1990s and replaced \nwith mandatory blending targets. \nIn the beginning of the 2000\u2019s, the Federal Government \nstarted incorporating biodiesel as part of reducing the \ndependency on fossil fuel. The intention of the Probio-\ndiesel program was also to add to the creation of jobs \nand income in the poorer parts of the country. \nBrazil is now among the largest producers and consum-\ners of biodiesel with an annual production of 1.6 billion \nlitres in 2009. The production is based on a mix of dif-\nferent oil crops (including beans and palm). There is an \nexpectation in Brazil that there will be a considerable \nexpansion of bioenergy production based on use of ag-\nricultural residues. Policies to increase biodiesel produc-\ntion include a special scheme (Social Fuel Seal), where bi-\nodiesel producers who buy feedstocks from small family \nfarms in poor regions pay less federal income tax.\nExperience with the Proalcool program gathered in the \n1980s  shows  that  rapid  expansion  of  biofuel  produc-\ntion can lead to the devastation of ecosystems. Poten-\ntial risks to biomass energy resources also include de-\nforestation and the degradation of other conservation \nland. Monocrop cultivation reduces biodiversity and soil \nfertility and degrades land. There is also a risk of com-\npetition for land between food production and biomass \nresources. \nBioenergy is not necessarily carbon-neutral, and addi-\ntional, often fossil energy is required for crop cultivation \nand fuel transportation (Galdos et al. 2010). In addition, \nincreasing international trade in bioenergy and biomass \nwill create further competitive pressure to expand un-\nsustainable  production.  Yet  with  improved  legislation \nand environmental enforcement and significant exper-\ntise in improving land-use management, some of the \nproblems faced in the early days of the Proalcool pro-\ngram have been reduced, e.g. through prohibition for \npreharvest straw burning.\nBrazil  adopted  a  National  Plan  on  Climate  Change  in \n2008 with the aim to identify, plan and coordinate ac-\ntions and measures that can be undertaken to mitigate \nGHG emissions generated in the country, as well as ac-\ntions for adaptation to climate change. In 2009, the Na-\ntional Policy on Climate Change was put in place, and \nthis policy aims to reconcile social and economic devel-\nopment with protection of the climate system through \nreductions of GHG emission and enhancement of CO2 \nremovals  through  sinks.  It  also  includes  measures  to \npromote adaptation to climate change, particularly for \nthe most vulnerable segments of society. The aim is to \nreduce projected emissions by 36-39 percent in 2020 \n(MCT 2010).\nHalf of Brazil is covered by forests, which includes both \nthe Amazon rain forest and the Cerrado. Recent migra-\ntions into the Amazon and large scale burning of for-\nest areas have placed the international spotlight on this \nsource  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  biodiversity \nloss. Much progress has been made in recent years to \ncombat deforestation, particularly in the Amazon. This \nhas been done through reduced incentives for activities \nleading to deforestation, implementation of an ambi-\ntious environmental plan, and adoption of an Environ-\nmental Crimes Law with serious penalties for violations. \nThis also includes the Action Plan for the Prevention and \nControl  of  Deforestation  in  the  Legal  Amazon.  These \nmeasures reduced the rate of deforestation by 73 per-\ncent, from 27,772 km\n2 in 2004 to 7,464 km\n2 in 2009. \nMuch  of  the  success  in  the  implementation  of  these \nmeasures is due to the fact that Brazil has advanced \nsystems for monitoring forest areas (MCT 2010). This in-\ncludes a remote sensing-based monitoring system for \nthe Amazon run by the National Institute for Space Re-\nsearch. Brazil has further developed a remote sensing 64\nsystem for monitoring burning activities. This resulted \nin creation of a Program for the Prevention and Control \nof Burnings and Forest Fires (Proarco). \nBrazil also has a large number of Federally Protected Ar-\neas covering 449,000 km\n2. When both state and federal \nprotected areas are added, the total is 2,386,000 km\n2, \naccounting for 28 percent of the country\u2019s territory. The \ngovernment further has a policy to double the planted \nforest area in Brazil. This planted forest will primarily be \nEucalyptus for paper and bioenergy production.\nA  number  of  activities  have  been  undertaken  under \nthe Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto \nProtocol. Some of these CDMs have also been applied \nto reduce GHG emissions from agriculture, in particular \nby reducing methane emissions from manure manage-\nment in large scale pig farms in Brazil. There have also \nbeen CDM activities to reduce methane emissions from \nmany small-scale pig farms.\nFor  some  further  concrete  policy  recommendations, \nsee section 9.3.2.65\n9  Conclusion: Policy \nrecommendations \u2013 how to \nachieve a climate friendly \nagriculture \nPolicy recommendations for the achievement of climate \nfriendly agriculture have to be developed in the context \nof the new paradigm for climate friendly agriculture as \npresented above in this report, and in the context of \nboth agricultural and climate policy. We repeat the five \nguiding principles for climate friendly agriculture (sec-\ntion 6): it has \nto account for trade-offs and choose system bound-   z\naries adequately; \nto account for synergies and adopt a systemic ap-   z\nproach; \nto  account  for  aspects  besides  mitigation  (adapta-   z\ntion, food security); \nto account for uncertainties and knowledge gaps; and    z\nto account for the context beyond the agricultural    z\nsector: consumption and waste patterns. \nPolicy recommendations have to fulfil criteria of their own \nas well: They basically need to answer what has to be done, \nwho has to do it and how it can be done. They thus need \nto be given in relation to clearly defined and concrete    z\ngoals;\nto address clearly named agents;   z\nto clearly define the actions these respective agents    z\nshould take.\nIn addition, we propose that they should\nbe in part pragmatic and in part visionary \u2013 but not    z\nonly  the  latter  alone  and  preferably  not  only  the \nformer alone.\nIn this context, we recommend concrete policy goals, \nagents and actions. This is done in a pragmatic way, i.e. \npurposely not covering all important aspects, but being \nselective by focusing on the most important, most ef-\nfective and most realistic aspects. And it should be done \nwith visionary ideas in mind, following new paths, where \nappropriate.\n9.1  Goals\nFrom the previous sections, we identify five main goals, \nwhich  policies  for  climate  friendly  agriculture  should \nfocus on. These are soil carbon, closed nutrient cycles, \nconsumption and waste patterns, nitrous oxide dynam-\nics  and  assessment  of  multi-functional  farming  sys-\ntems. \n9.1.1 Increase soil carbon\nIncreasing soil carbon levels has a huge mitigation po-\ntential. It is not permanent and has saturation dynam-\nics, but it could considerably contribute to gain time for \nstringent and permanent mitigation options in agricul-\nture and other sectors. \nIncreasing soil carbon levels is of paramount importance \nfor increased soil fertility, soil and plant health and thus \nfor climate change adaptation, securing rural livelihoods \nand food security. The non-permanence is not crucial in \nthis regard, as past achievements (e.g. food security in \nthe previous year) are not lost from a change in man-\nagement practices today. The saturation aspect is not \nproblematic either, as a certain high soil carbon level also \nallows for adaptation and food security if no further in-\ncrease of soil carbon contents takes place. \n9.1.2 Realise closed nutrient cycles in agriculture \nIncreasing soil carbon levels strongly depends on the \ninput of organic matter through crop residues and or-\nganic fertilizers and also on the presence of grass-clo-\nver/forage legumes leys in the crop rotation. Nutrient \nrecycling has to take into account the biomass exported \nfrom the farms as well. This is an issue when agricultural \ngoods are not processed at the production site and thus 66\ncontribute to nutrient deficits there and nutrient over-\nsupply in the areas where the processing occurs. This is \nan issue in the context of urban hot-spots of organic \nwaste generation and can even have a global dimen-\nsion when production in the South and processing in \nthe North lead to unsustainable nutrient outflows from \nSouth to North.\nClosed nutrient cycles have several advantages regard-\ning nitrogen (e.g. avoidance of the energy intensive syn-\nthetic fertilizer production and generally reduced nitro-\ngen losses resulting in reduced negative environmental \nimpacts), but they are even more important regarding \nnon-renewable nutrients such as phosphorus. \nIn the context of the emerging \u201cpeak-phosphorus\u201d dis-\ncussion, saving use and recycling of this nutrient is of \nsignificant importance. Fertilisation strategies have to \nbe developed for the agricultural sector on regional and \nnational levels aiming at a resource-efficient utilisation \nof organic and synthetic fertilisers. \nTherefore large carbon and nitrogen surpluses in farm \nbalances in intensive livestock regions have to be bal-\nanced  out  with  carbon  and  nitrogen  deficits  in  areas \nwith only little livestock. This would have to be achieved \nby  transporting  manure  or  nutrients  from  processed \nmanure (e.g. pellets) on a regional level, as far as this \ntransporting and processing makes sense, and \u2013 espe-\ncially important \u2013 by structural policy, to set incentives \nfor mixed farming systems, so as to have livestock pro-\nduction integrated with the production of the feed for \nthe livestock.\n9.1.3 Change consumption and waste patterns\nWithout  changes  in  consumption  patterns,  climate \nfriendly agriculture will never be possible. The primary \ngoal is a considerable reduction of ruminant meat con-\nsumption. But also changes towards increased accept-\nance and consumption of resistant and locally adapted \nvarieties are important. Finally, consumer changes di-\nrectly influence energy use. Choosing seasonal and in \naddition local products as well as reducing food waste \nwould reduce corresponding emissions. \nAnother  big  potential  for  increased  mitigation  lies  in \navoiding current food wastage. In developing countries, \nstorage losses could be avoided with improved infra-\nstructure. A totally different strategy is needed in de-\nveloped countries where food waste occurs for the end \nproduct. Unrestricted availability of fresh food, expecta-\ntions regarding freshness and clean look are drivers of \nthis wastage. Attempts to change this have to address \nconsumer behaviour directly. \n9.1.4 Improve the scientific knowledge on nitrous \noxide dynamics\nAlthough many aspects of methane emissions from ru-\nminants and manure still need more research, the situa-\ntion with regard to nitrous oxide from soils is even more \ncomplex. A robust finding is that lower nitrogen applica-\ntion rates correlate with lower nitrous oxide emissions, \nthus reducing nitrogen inputs is key for a climate friend-\nly agriculture. But the details of nitrous oxide emissions \nare still only partly understood. Of particular importance \nis a better understanding of the emissions from vari-\nous types of organic fertilizers and green manures and \nhow  to  optimally  apply  them  to  keep  emissions  at  a \nminimum.  Furthermore,  improved  understanding  on \nthe influence of site-specific parameters on emissions \nis necessary. Also the trade-off between carbon seques-\ntration through carbon and nitrogen containing humus \nbuilt up at the one side with the release of nitrous oxide \non the other side needs further scientific investigation \nat an international level. \n9.1.5 Develop methods for the optimal \nassessment of complex, multi-functional farming \nsystems\nQuantification  of  emissions  and  sequestration  in  the \ncontext of climate friendly agriculture is necessary. Al-\nthough uncertainties prevail and knowledge gaps hinder \nthorough assessment of the exact mitigation potential \nof many practices, trends can often be identified and it \nis also necessary to do so. Quantification however needs \nto be done in such a way that no bias is introduced. \nThere is a danger that easily quantifiable solutions win \nover truly sustainable solutions simply because the lat-67\nter might be more difficult to quantify. There is still a \nneed for conceptual work on how to best assess agri-\ncultural systems with various outputs and services in the \ncontext of mitigation. How this assessment is done will \nbe influential on the type of agriculture that will be sup-\nported as climate friendly and also on which importance \nother sustainability aspects will have.\n9.2  Agents and Actions\nWe  frame  the  discussion  in  this  section  according  to \nthe  goals  identified  above.  We  aim  at  identifying  the \nrelevant agents and the necessary actions, and provide \nsome  suggestions  for  promising  policy  instruments. \nThereby, we aim to be as concrete as possible. Also, we \nindicate the level where appropriate policies should be \nexecuted (regional/national/international). Although we \nwould like to, it is impossible for us to recommend a sin-\ngle policy instrument as the instrument of first choice \nto reach a certain goal. Such an optimality assessment \nof various policy instruments is beyond the scope of this \nreport and needs to be done for each case in its specific \nsectoral and regional or country context separately. \nOf general importance is the inclusion of the paradigms \nfor  climate  friendly  agriculture  in  the  relevant  policy \ndocuments, such as legislative texts for the CAP reform \nof the European Union, texts for UNFCCC Ad-hoc Work-\ning Group meetings and also the IPCC 5th Assessment \nReport. NGOs and other stakeholders should be ahead \nof these drafting processes and provide relevant and \nconcrete formulations to the respective writing bodies \nearly in the process to allow for critical discussion and \nadequate consideration of these aspects. \n9.2.1 Increase soil carbon \nFor this goal, most important is action on national levels \nand on the level of the UNFCCC. Governments of non-\nAnnex I countries should incorporate the increase of soil \ncarbon levels both in their Nationally Appropriate Miti-\ngation Actions (NAMAs) and in their National Adaptation \nProgrammes  of  Actions  (NAPAs),  thus  accounting  for \nthe strong synergies between mitigation and adapta-\ntion in soil carbon increases. This has to go well beyond \nmere declaration of intents. Concrete measures need to \nbe formulated in the NAMAs and NAPAs, such as sup-\nport for the various practices that increase soil carbon \nlevels via tax- or payments for environmental services \nschemes or some prescription of certain management \npractices. \nAs said, the decision on which of these policy instru-\nments is most appropriate also depends on local condi-\ntions and further analysis is necessary for each concrete \ncase. There is a window of opportunity now with regard \nto NAMAs, as their institutionalisation is currently under \ndiscussion, but it is not yet defined. NGOs should thus \nwork towards adequate coverage of sustainable agricul-\nture therein. \nGovernments of Annex-I countries should incorporate \nsoil carbon sequestration (or losses) in their national in-\nventories and in their adaptation strategies. This would \nmake it visible to policy makers and put it on the agenda \nfor interventions. The UNFCCC should make accounting \nfor soil carbon in inventories mandatory, as this would \nurge nations to include it and as it would also establish \na level playing field between nations regarding this miti-\ngation aspect. \nOn the level of EU and national policies, all countries \nshould change their subsidy schemes for agriculture to-\nwards payments for environmental services, thus also \ncovering increased soil carbon levels.\nSimilarly, financial funds for mitigation and adaptation \n(as the Adaptation Fund) should take a strong position \non supporting practices that lead to increased soil car-\nbon levels. Clearly, financing also needs to support re-\nlated dissemination and extension activities.\nIt is important to emphasize that support schemes need \nto account for the systemic character of sustainable ag-\nriculture. Techniques focussing on no-till only, for ex-\nample, are not sufficient, as they are not well adapted \nto  other  soil  fertility  increasing  strategies  such  as  di-\nversified crop-rotations, use of organic fertilizers and \nthe reduction of herbicide and fungicide use. Effective \nstrategies need to optimally combine nutrient recycling, 68\nsoil conservation and increased agro-biodiversity. It is a \ntask for state research to also focus on such systemic \nstrategies.\n9.2.2 Closed nutrient cycles\nAs for soil carbon, incorporation of nutrient recycling \nand optimal use of biomass should be covered in   NAMAs, \nNAPAs and agricultural policy on all levels. This would \nparallel  a  development  of  reduced  synthetic  fertilizer \nuse. Policies setting maximum allowed rates for nitro-\ngen inputs, such as the EU Nitrate Directive, or avoiding \nuse of inorganic fertilizers, such as area payments for \norganic farming can be very successful in this. \nEspecially in areas with marginal soils and nutrient-de-\nficiency, optimal combination of organic and synthetic \nfertilizers should be promoted. Governments need to \nassure that any policy aiming at closed nutrient cycles is \ndeveloped in close interaction with bioenergy policies, \nto avoid incompatible proposals due to lack of biomass \nfor both strategies. \nInformation provision and skill development on how to \noptimally produce and use organic fertilizers (e.g. com-\npost) play an important part for achieving this goal. The \ncorresponding extension services have to be established \nand trained by governments and NGOs. \nA dialogue with the fertilizer industry needs to be sought; \nit could be inspiring to learn from electricity producers, \nwhere promoting energy efficiency, superficially going \nagainst their business of selling electricity, becomes a \nnew, profitable business field. Initiatives in this spirit are \nalready under way in the US and Canada (VCS 2010, GoA \n2010), covering reduction in fertilizer use, but not nutri-\nent cycling, though. In regions where mixed farms are \neconomically and socially still viable, this type of farms \nshould be encouraged by advisory services. \nAs an alternative, policy actions should heavily focus on \ngiving preference to small-scale cooperations of farms \nin order to combine the positive effects of former mixed \nfarming with the economic gains of specialisation and \neconomy of scale. \n9.2.3 Change in consumption and waste patterns\nChanges in food consumption and waste patterns are \nthe most difficult, but at the same time the most effec-\ntive measures. First, an honest dialogue on consump-\ntion and waste patterns needs to be started in our liber-\nal societies, where the core-value of individual freedom \nconflicts with prescribing life-styles to individuals. Start-\ning such a dialogue lies in the responsibility of politi-\ncians. Ultimately, changing consumption patterns is not \nabout prescribing life-styles but about rising awareness \nfor the impacts of our actions in a globalized world. Not \nrestricting the freedom of others by our actions is also a \ncore value in liberal societies. In contrast to most other \npolicy instruments, it has to be seen in the time frame \nof several decades or generations rather than of a few \nyears. \nChanging consumption and waste patterns clearly also \nlies in the responsibility of individuals. Individuals must \ndevelop an understanding of themselves as citizens in a \nglobalized world and not merely as consumers. This can \nbe supported by information provision, but ultimately, \na discussion about values and preferences and about \nnotions of what constitutes a good life and about the \nvirtues of prudence and moderation cannot be avoided. \nThe key is to involve a broad public in this discussion \nand do so in an official policy frame, avoiding unpopular \nlabels such as \u201calternative\u201d, \u201cesoteric\u201d, \u201cdeep-green\u201d or \nother approaches lacking general acceptance. \nThere are a number of official governmental and related \nreports pointing in this direction, but they have never \nachieved much attention (e.g. UNEP 2001; Kaenzig and \nJolliet  2006;  IPCC  2007;  ECEEE  2006;  moderately,  but \nnevertheless pointing out the key role of consumers: \nWorld Bank 2010). It is especially the role of NGOs to sup-\nport politicians and governmental agencies to develop-\ning this topic to a level, where it can become a legitimate \ntopic in policy debates. \nThe interdependence of eating and food waste habits \nwith the quality of our landscapes, with the attractive-\nness and ecological soundness of our farms and with \nthe health and well-being of citizens should become the 69\nmajor content of the campaigns of all NGOs for years in \norder to change public awareness. \nAlthough a totally different dynamic is behind wastage \nfrom storage losses in developing countries, we shortly \ncover this here as well. Improved infrastructure, logistics \nand training are necessary to reduce these losses. This \nand the respective financial means should be promoted \nand provided by governments. \nNGOs  should  also  implement  such  projects.  Part  of \nthese projects will be of comparatively low complexity \nand have big effects with few means (e.g. provision of \nsimple household or community storage facilities). \n9.2.4 Nitrous oxide dynamics\nKnowledge on factors that affect nitrous oxide emissions \nare still scarce, in particular when it comes to technolo-\ngies and management measures that can control and \nreduce these emissions. Here, research institutes and, \nin consequence, institutions financing research (govern-\nmental agencies, but also large NGOs and private funds) \nneed to take action. \nMore research on nitrous oxide emissions from fertilized \nsoils is needed, in particular differentiating for different \norganic fertilizer types and green manuring strategies. \nFor this, ideally, a well-designed global initiative for con-\ntinuous measurements in various climate zones, and for \nvarious soil types and farming systems should be estab-\nlished. Besides fertilizer types and site-specific charac-\nteristics, this research should also cover interactions of \nnitrous oxide emissions with soil carbon sequestration \nin particular. Although the situation is somewhat bet-\nter regarding understanding methane emissions, more \nresearch is needed there as well. \n9.2.5 Assessment of multi-functional farming \nsystems\nAdditional research is needed on the role of multi-func-\ntional  farming  systems,  too,  thus  pledging  the  same \nagents as above. Also, large retailers and other agents \nalong the value chain should provide means to reach \nthis goal, as they increasingly demand such assessments \nin the context of carbon footprints for single products, \netc. This endeavour can draw on a rich body of knowl-\nedge in both life cycle analysis for agricultural products \nand in multi-criteria analysis. \nPolicymakers  and  governmental  institutions  also  play \nan important role, as they need to communicate that a \nreliable assessment and comparison of multi-functional \nfarming systems and quantification of key sustainability \naspects of those is not yet established, thus avoiding \nbias for preliminary and incomplete solutions with cor-\nresponding  biases  towards  certain  unsustainable,  but \neasily quantifiable systems.\n9.3  Policy recommendations in detail\nWe close this report with an attempt to provide some \npolicy recommendations in further detail and on a more \nspecific level of concreteness. This has illustrative char-\nacter only, as providing very concrete policy recommen-\ndations for specific contexts such as certain sub-sectors \nof agriculture or regions in the EU, in Brazil or Indonesia \nneeds to be based on a much more in-depth analysis of \nthe current situation for each specific case and its local \ncontext. This clearly is beyond the scope of this report. \nNevertheless, this attempt of more concreteness may \ninspire such additional work. We structure this part ac-\ncording to the three case-study regions and countries \nEU, Brazil and Indonesia. \n9.3.1 EU\nIn  the  cross  compliance  regulations  of  the  EU  com-\nmon agricultural policy (CAP) attention is already paid \nto  maintaining  and  increasing  soil  carbon  levels,  via \nthe  humus  content,  but  the  current  practice  is  not \nvery effective. In Germany for instance, a humus bal-\nance is not compulsory, when the farmer cultivates at \nleast 3 different crops (each crop must cover at least \n15 percent of the agricultural land) or cultivates pre-\ndominantly humus \u201cneutral\u201d or \u201cpositive\u201d crops. But if \nthe farmer does not follow these two options, only a \nfarm-gate balance or soil sampling for humus analysis \nhas to be conducted. 70\nThe  required  farm  gate  balance,  however,  is  too  un-\nspecific as it doesn\u2019t show the humus dynamics of the \nvarious fields. To allow for effective action the future \nEU-CAP should regulate a field-specific humus balance. \nWith this more detailed balance the message should be \ntransferred, that humus is not just a criterion of the \ncross-compliance catalogue, it is also an agronomic and \nenvironmental good!\nIn the same direction goes the proposal of the German \npeasant  association  AbL  (Arbeitsgemeinschaft  b\u00e4uerli-\nche Landwirtschaft) (AbL 2011). In their opinion farmers \nshould qualify for getting full support from the first pil-\nlar of the EU-CAP when a crop rotation is realized and \n20 percent of the cultivated crops are legumes such as \ngrass clover leys known to be effective in humus accu-\nmulation. If a farmer does not take this option he will \nget 30 percent less direct payment and this withdrawn \nmoney is used for agri-environmental measures in the \n2nd pillar. \nThe  commitment  to  grow  grain  legumes  in  Europe \nwould also influence land use in North and South Amer-\nica,  where  soybean  monocultures  exert  negative  im-\npacts on greenhouse gas balances especially when land \nuse change is involved.\nAnother  effective  measure  is  the  EU-wide  promotion \nand support of tillage practices preventing soil erosion. \nIn some member states these options are part of the \ncurrent agricultural subsidy schemes already, but there \nis  still  a  substantial  part  of  agricultural  land,  which  is \nprone to erosion because of slope exposition and poor \nsoil aggregation (e.g. sandy texture) and not managed \nadequately. \nA framework of good tillage practices including cover \ncrops on EU level is urgently needed and basic measures \ne.g. to prevent soil and nutrient loss at hillside situations \nshould be part of direct payment schemes (cross com-\npliance) and additional measures e.g. plough avoidance \ncan be supported through 2nd pillar programmes.\nThe  recycling  of  organic  refuse  from  households \n(kitchen refuse, green waste from gardens, lawns, etc.) \nneeds to be further developed EU-wide. Some regions \nand countries have recycling activities ongoing where \nthese organic materials are separated from municipal \nsolid waste, collected separately and processed at com-\nposting facilities and brought back to agricultural soils. \nComposts however have not the best reputation among \nfarmers and need promotion. As composts are also val-\nuable phosphate fertiliser a strategy needs to be devel-\noped to enable humus increase, general soil improve-\nment and phosphate fertilisation at the same time.\nBesides increasing soil carbon, action is needed on clos-\ning nutrient cycles. Closing nutrient cycles does imply to \ndevelop fertiliser strategies at national level. This ferti-\nliser strategy should aim at prioritising manure/fertiliser \ntypes. At the moment (arable) farmers are not obliged \nto make use of organic manures (slurries, solid wastes, \ncomposts, etc.), which are at surpluses in some areas. \nOften they do not know about the multiple benefits of \norganic manures (humus built-up, C-sequestration, N, P, \nK fertilisation, etc.) and just go for the established min-\neral fertilisers. An organic manure network needs to be \ndeveloped at national levels, which run an organic ma-\nnure exchange (internet) platform where seller and buy-\ner of organic manures meet. Such an exchange platform \nexists for fermented slurries and composts in Germany \n(www.kompost.de) but needs to be further developed \nfor solid manures and unfermented slurries. \nSuch manure exchanges enable the reduction of syn-\nthetic  N-fertiliser  in  agriculture  (reduction  of  nitrous \noxide from fertiliser industry and cultivated soils) and \nsoil organic carbon increase at the same time. Making \nuse of organic manures at least for the basic fertilisa-\ntion (Humus, N, P and K content, lime) before applying \nmineral fertiliser should be implemented into the cross-\ncompliance catalogue of EU-CAP. In that context farmers \nshould indicate that they check availability of regional \norganic manure suppliers and make use of manures (or \nnot) depending on availability.\nNitrogen surpluses well above 50 kg/ha exist in many \nEU countries/regions (http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-\nand-maps/figures/estimated-nitrogen-surplus-across-71\neurope-2005):  e.g.  Bretagne,  Netherlands,  Belgium, \nNorthwest  Germany,  Denmark,  Northern  Italy.  The  EU \nfarmers, however, are not obliged for effective nitro-\ngen control, as they are only obliged to calculate annual \nfarmgate  balances  for  nitrogen  and  phosphorous.  As \nfor humus (see above) also an area-specific nutrient bal-\nance should become compulsory for farmers in the EU \nand payments should be tied to performance regarding \nnitrogen efficiency, inputs and runoff.\nRenaissance of leguminous crops: Nitrogen-fixing leg-\numes should become integral parts of European agricul-\nture. As outlined above maize displaced legumes in Mid \nEuropean agriculture along with soil carbon losses and \nother effects. The already mentioned proposal by the \nGerman  peasant  association  AbL  (Arbeitsgemeinschaft \nb\u00e4uerliche Landwirtschaft) (AbL 2011) appears to be ef-\nfective to stimulate the cultivation of N-fixing legumes \nin the EU along with a reduction of synthetic nitrogen.\nThe further promotion and financial support of organic \nfarming  has  many  climate-related  and  environmental \nbenefits.  It  is  a  systemic  approach  and  targets  many \nsustainability criteria including the closed cycle principle \nat the same time. European and national governments \nshould dedicate a substantial part of their budgets for \nresearch and development of organic farming systems \nas it also offers great potential to developing countries \nbecause of low-external inputs requirements. The con-\ntinuation of supporting the conversion and perpetua-\ntion of organic farming through payments of the sec-\nond pillar of the EU-CAP is necessary in that respect.\nAnimal numbers need to be limited and livestock units (= \nnumber of animals/ha of agricultural land) similar to the \none of the EU organic regulation (EG-\u00d6ko-Verordnung \nNr. 889/2008) have to be introduced into the EU legis-\nlation. This will help to avoid the questionable concen-\ntration of large animal units in the Central and Eastern \nEuropean countries like East Germany, Czech Republic \nand Poland where investors established poultry, pig and \nother factories in the past with insufficient linkage to \nthe  available  agricultural  land  and  the  corresponding \nexcess of nitrogen of animal excrements at farm sur-\nroundings.\n9.3.2 Indonesia\nA number of programs and recommendations are ini-\ntiated or considered by the Indonesian Government to \nreach the proposed emission reductions (Las et al. 2008, \nBAPPENAS 2010).\nTechnical Recommendations: Major areas of action in-   z\nclude the implementation of no-burning technology \nfor land clearing and land preparation, in food crop, \nhorticulture, and in the plantation sub-sectors. Fur-\nthermore, new low methane emitting technologies \nfor bioenergy and composting and improved feed \nand optimization of the productivity of existing ag-\nricultural lands will be supported. Through introduc-\ntion of carbon efficient farming technologies and the \nincreasing use of organic fertilizer and bio-pesticides \nemission avoidance strategies are supported. \nWeather  related  recommendations:  Based  on  Data    z\nfrom the Badan Meterologie Klimatologi dean Geofisi-\nka (BMKG) the monsoon onset has changed in many \nparts of Indonesia . It is e.g. delayed in Java and the \nwet season has tended to shorten almost by a month \n(Sofian 2010). It is further forecasted that the rainfall \npattern will change under increasing GHG emissions \nand most Indonesian regions will experience much \nhigher  rainfall  than  under  the  current  conditions \nform 2025 onward (Anonyma 2010). Therefore, farm-\ners need proper weather forecasts to optimize the \nwater-logged period of the paddies.\nRecommendations for rice cultivation: Introduction    z\nof low emitting rice varieties like Ciherang, Cisantana, \nTukad  Belian  and  Way  Apo  Buru  is  recommended \nbesides  preparation  of  seed  stocks  for  accelerated \nplanting. A modified cropping pattern, improved nu-\ntrient supply, seed and seedbed management, ecolo-\ngy-based pest management and smart management \nof rice residues is also recommended. The incorpora-\ntion of appropriate fallow periods and mulching of \nrice straw is seen as a highly efficient measure to re-\nduce methane emissions. The employment of the SRI \nmethod is supported because up to 60 percent of \nthe methane emissions could be avoided. Further, by 72\nturning rice straw and husks into \u201cbiochar\u201d or ashes, \nemissions can be reduced by up to 85 percent from \nthe respective paddies. \nEstablishment  of  efficient  irrigation  and  water  saving \ntechniques like optimizing irrigation patterns for rice and \nnon-rice crops, distinct drainage periods within the sea-\nson to reduce methane emissions, intermitted and pulse \nirrigation is compared to the conventional continuously \nflooded system reducing CH4 emissions up to 62 percent \nand therefore highly recommended (Setyanto 2004). \nTentative time table for implementation of recom-   z\nmended policies for emission reduction from pad-\ndies  (Anonyma  2007,  Anonyma  2010,  Naylor  et  al. \n2007, Boer et al. 2005, 2009):\nBy 2015\nPlanning and discussion with all stakeholders of the re-\nspective National Action Plan (NAP) and establishment \nof  the  required  instruments  with  the  cross-sectoral \nsupport of all agencies involved. The different sources \nfor funding the activities to reduce the emissions need \nto be established including the so-called Indonesian Cli-\nmate Trust Fund (ICCTF). \nThe  recommendations  concerning  rice  cultivation,  in-\ncluding  cropping  pattern,  crop  management,  and  ir-\nrigation efficiency must be transferred into respective \nactivities in the field.\nBy 2030\nThe  recommendation  to  ban  the  conversion  of  rice-\nfields to other use and the expansion of the rice grow-\ning area must be fulfilled.\nThe forest cover must be maintained and increased and \nfood consumption must be diversified.\n9.3.3 Brazil\nBrazil has a huge potential for production of food and \nbioenergy. However, any expansion of the agricultural \narea into native areas have large negative consequences \nfor biodiversity and also leads to large emissions of CO2. \nIt is therefore essential from a climate perspective to \npreserve the carbon in the native vegetation by avoid-\ning further expansion of the agricultural area. To ensure \nthat the agricultural activities are sustainable from both \neconomic, environmental and social perspectives, poli-\ncies should ensure that emphasis is given to maintaining \nsoil fertility and to growing high yielding crops in crop \nrotations that add resilience to climatic and biological \nthreats. \nThe  further  expansion  of  agricultural  land  into  native \nforests and savannah regions can most likely only be \nprevented  through  strong  federal  legislation  against \ndeforestation with severe penalties coupled with local \nenforcement and social programmes that offer alterna-\ntive livelihoods to the rural poor.\nThe sustainability of large-scale farming systems can be \nimproved through legislation and adoption of sustain-\nability  criteria  (e.g.  based  on  cross-compliance  for  fi-\nnancial support) that are then controlled by federal or \nregional agencies. Such sustainability criteria should be \nincorporated into the agricultural and/or environmental \npolicies and legislation. Elements of such sustainability \ncriteria could be:\nrequirements for recycling of animal manure, house-   z\nhold waste and urban organic waste onto the agricul-\ntural lands;\nelimination of burning of straw or any other organic    z\nmaterials in the field;\navoidance of intensive soil tillage;   z\nuse of crop rotations and cover crops to retain nutri-   z\nents and increase soil organic matter;\nUse of integrated crop and livestock systems (mixed    z\nfarming);\nimproved manure management to reduce emissions    z\nduring manure storage;73\nrestoration of degraded pastures and introduction of    z\nagroforestry systems in pastures;\nuse of dryland rice or intermittent flooding systems    z\nin rice cultivation.\nFor smallholder systems it may not be feasible to adopt \nstrict legislation that will require extensive control sys-\ntems. However, many of the measures that are listed for \nthe intensive large-scale farming systems will in princi-\nple also apply in smallholder systems. In addition many \nagroecological techniques that make use of more com-\nplex  combinations  of  special  plant  and  crop-livestock \nsystems can also be used here. Some of these systems \nwill typically be classified as organic farming systems, \nand the certification of smallholders within an organic \nfarming scheme may be one way forward. In many cases \nthe most efficient way of improving the sustainability \nfor smallholders is via improving their knowledge and \nskills and their access to the necessary equipment and \nto finance. There is a particular need for setting up com-\nmunity-based programmes that can provide a range of \nservices to overcome current barriers. This may include \nEducation within climate-friendly farming,   z\nAgricultural extension services,    z\nMicro-credits for financing investments in new tech-   z\nniques, \nCommon  management  of  woodlands  or  grazing    z\nlands to avoid degradation, and \nEstablishing market access for products that may also    z\nbe certified. \nSuch approaches should be supported trough the agri-\ncultural policy, but may also be targeted by NGOs.74\nReferences\nAbL/Arbeitsgemeinschaft b\u00e4uerliche Landwirtschaft (2011): EU-Agrarreform einfach und wirksam.

    "fullText": " \nBy J\u00f8rgen E. Olesen \n  \nClimate-friendly food \nThe greatest potential for reducing the impact of climate change on the production and \nconsumption of food is expected to lie in influencing consumers\u2019 choice of food products \n  \nClimate change is without doubt one of the greatest challenges mankind has ever faced. This is \nnot least due to the enormous consequences that climate change will have for the world\u2019s \necosystems and for our living conditions. At the same time, climate change is a colossal political \nproblem, in which the world\u2019s democracies run the risk not being able to carry out the decisions \nthat have to be made. \nThe political and democratic problem builds on the very limited understanding that there is a \nconnection between emissions of greenhouse gases, climate change and their impact on the \nliving conditions of individual people. \nIn reality, there is both a spatial and a temporal separation between emissions and effects. The \nworld\u2019s industrialised countries, which emit by far the largest amount of greenhouse gases, are \nin the first instance the least vulnerable to the effects of climate change. In addition, serious \neffects will first occur much later (decades to centuries) than the emissions. Therefore it can be \nvery difficult to generate popular backing for serious initiatives against emissions of greenhouse \ngases. \nAgriculture and food production play an important role in this connection due to the importance \nof climate change for agriculture\u2019s production basis and because it is one of the sectors emitting \nmost greenhouse gases. For agriculture, the climate challenge is therefore double \u2013 it must both \nadapt to the changes and at the same time reduce its emissions of greenhouse gases. \n  \nAgriculture\u2019s emissions \nAgricultural production results in emissions of methane (CH4) and laughing gas (N2O), which \ncontribute to the man-made greenhouse effect. The greenhouse effects of methane and laughing \ngas are 23 and 296 times more powerful respectively than the effect of carbon dioxide (CO2).  \nCO2 from biological processes is neutral in relation to the greenhouse gas effect, but changes in \nland use in forestry and agriculture as well as between them can impact on the storage of carbon \nin the soil and thus on the balance between bound and atmospheric CO2. Further, agriculture has \nan energy consumption (direct and indirect) that also contributes to CO2 emission. In part this \ncan be compensated for through the use of biomass for energy production. \nOn a global scale, the overall emissions from agriculture are estimated at 17-32 per cent of the \ntotal emissions. A very great proportion of these emissions is related to livestock production. \nThe great uncertainty is especially connected with the emissions resulting from clearing woods \nand cultivating the soil.  \nIn Denmark, agriculture\u2019s emissions amount to about 16 per cent of the national emissions of \ngreenhouse gases. Emissions of methane and laughing gas from Danish agriculture fell by 26 \nper cent in the period from 1990 to 2006. The fall is especially due to smaller cattle herds and a \nconsiderable increase in agriculture\u2019s nitrogen efficiency as a result of the implementation of the \naquatic environment plans. \nFor Denmark, the EU\u2019s new proposal for an energy and climate directive means: \n  \n         An increase in renewable energy\u2019s share of energy supply from 10 to 30 per cent by \n 2020 \n         A 20 per cent reduction in CO2 emissions in 2020, compared with 2005, from sectors \n(including agriculture) that are not subject to quotas, and  \n         10 per cent of the transport sector\u2019s energy consumptions must come from biofuels in \n2020. This obviously implies both challenges and opportunities for agriculture. \n  \nMethane \n  \nMethane is formed through the decomposition of organic substances under completely oxygen-\nfree conditions, such as those found in animals\u2019 digestive systems and in environments that are \npermanently waterlogged. Ruminants\u2019 digestion is the greatest single source of methane in \nagriculture.  \nThere are also good conditions for methane production in liquid manure tanks, depending on the \ncomposition of the liquid manure and on the temperature in the tank. Methane oxidation can \noccur in the floating membrane and this is estimated to reduce methane emissions by about 10 \nper cent. Re-establishing wetlands can increase methane emissions because the changed water \nlevel distorts the balance between methane production and methane oxidation. \nMethane from animals\u2019 digestion can be reduced by changed feed or through the use of \nmethane-inhibiting substances. However, this has a number of undesired side-effects. On the \nother hand, there are a large number of possibilities for reducing emissions of methane and \nlaughing gas from animal manure. The treatment of liquid manure in joint biogas plants in \nparticular has a potential for considerable reductions in emissions. \nThere are also possibilities through new technological initiatives, including more frequent \nsluicing out of liquid manure to storage, acidification of the liquid manure and the establishment \nof floating membranes and permanent covers on the liquid manure tanks. Finally, there are \npossibilities for reduction through e.g. burning hard animal manure or air-tight coverage of hard \nfertilizer. \n  \nLaughing gas \nLaughing gas in soil is primarily formed as an intermediate product in the bacterial nitrogen \ncycle. The formation can occur through the nitrification of ammonia to nitrate or through the \ndenitrification of nitrate to free nitrogen (N2). The processes in the nitrogen cycle are influenced \nby a number of conditions in the soil, such as accessibility of oxygen and organic substances, \nthe soil\u2019s pH and the moisture content.  \nLaughing gas emissions occur especially from soil and manure stores. In addition, there is an \nemission added to the amount of nitrogen that is lost from the agricultural cycle through \nammonia evaporation and nitrate leaching, as these losses are transformed in other eco-systems \nwith emissions of laughing gas as a result. \nEmissions of laughing gas can be reduced by cutting the use of nitrogen fertilizers and by \nreducing losses through ammonia evaporation and nitrate leaching. An increased utilisation of \nnitrogen in particular results in a reduction of laughing gas emissions.  \nOther options are to introduce a cultivation practice that has a documented effect in reducing \nlaughing gas emissions from a given quantity of applied nitrogen fertilizer, e.g. with shared \nmanuring, by avoiding nitrate-rich fertilizers in the spring, by not using commercial fertilizers at \nthe same time as livestock manure, by using nitrification inhibitors in the fertilizer and by \ntreating liquid manure in biogas plants. \n  Carbon in soil \nThe amount of carbon (C) in agricultural systems comprises primarily C in the soil\u2019s organic \nsubstances. In particular, the carbon content in agricultural soil can be influenced through the \naddition of crop residue and animal manure.  \nIn addition, the intensity with which the soil is worked plays a role for carbon storage. Direct \nsowing will thus lead to an accumulation of carbon compared with traditional ploughing. The \nincrease in the soil\u2019s carbon store is especially large under grass fields and a part of the carbon \nstorage occurs under the ploughed layer. Re-establishing wetlands on organic soil would be \nparticularly effective in increasing CO2 storage as it would stop the decomposition of organic \nsubstances in this humus-rich soil and, under certain circumstances, would increase the \nrecycling of plant remains. \n  \nThe impact of food products on the climate \nEuropean studies have shown that the overall consumption of food products, beverages, tobacco \nand other stimulants amounts to 22-31 per cent of the EU's total contribution to greenhouse gas \nemissions. Meat and meat products are the foodstuffs that have the greatest impact on the \nclimate, followed by the dairy products milk, cheese and butter (see the table). The lowest \nimpact on the climate is from vegetable food products.  \nAgricultural production is the link in the production chain which for all food products causes the \ngreatest emission of greenhouse gases, while, on the other hand, only a small part of the \nemissions come from manufacturing, packaging and transport.  \nIt is therefore in agricultural production where initiatives to support a climate-friendly \nagriculture should primarily be directed. Life-cycle analyses of food product systems show that \nthe annual emission of a milk cow is about 14 ton CO2 equivalents per hectare, from a sow with \nher production of porkers about 7.5 ton CO2 equivalents, and from plant cultivation about 3.5 \nton CO2 equivalents. An analysis of available initiatives for reducing emissions shows that the \nrealistic potential for emissions reduction at present in Danish agriculture is about 15, 20 and 30 \nper cent for livestock, pig and crop cultivation respectively. \nThe greatest potential for reducing the climate impact of production and consumption of \nfoodstuffs must be expected to lie in influencing consumers\u2019 choice of foodstuffs, so they tend \nto a greater extent to choose the climate-friendly foodstuffs based on plant products (flour, \nbread, meal) and outdoor vegetables and less of the animal foodstuffs that have a large climate \nimpact (especially meat, milk and other dairy products, as well as eggs). At the same time, this \nwill be in line with general dietary advice about a sound and balanced diet. \nThe challenge will be to support a situation where production and consumption of foodstuffs has \nthe least possible impact on the climate. As a food exporting country, we are forced to realise \nthat climate documentation will be one of the competitive parameters of the future, either \ndirectly through a system of labelling the climate impact of foodstuffs or indirectly by central \nplayers in the foodstuffs industry and retailers making climate-related demands on their \nproducts. \n  \nBioenergy\u2019s contribution \nAgriculture today contributes with about 24 PJ of biomass to energy, equalling about 3 per cent \nof Denmark\u2019s total energy supply. Analyses have shown that an increased exploitation of \nresidual products such as liquid manure and straw can result in two to three times as much \nbioenergy from agriculture. If, in addition, we change 15 per cent of the corn-growing area to \nenergy crops, then the supply of bioenergy from agriculture can be almost five times higher. There are considerable uncertainties involved in calculating the overall impact of increased \nbioenergy utilisation on greenhouse gas emissions, as there is great uncertainty about the precise \nquantification of how this would affect the soil\u2019s carbon pool. In addition, the type of energy \ncrops that would be chosen for cultivation will have great importance, as cultivating annual \ncrops will generally reduce the soil\u2019s carbon pool, while cultivation of perennial crops can be \nexpected to increase the soil\u2019s carbon pool. \nIncreased biomass production will also be able to raise the extent of other environmental \nproblems. This can happen for example if fallow areas are recultivated with annual crops that \ncontribute to higher use of pesticides and loss of nutrients. The opposite can also be the case, \nhowever \u2013 e.g. when changing from grain production on environmentally sensitive areas to \nperennial energy crops with lower loss of nutrients and low pesticide consumption. \n  \nWhat can be done? \nAchieving a considerable reduction in the climate impact of food production demands initiatives \nin many areas. There is a need to reduce emissions in primary production. Here it is especially \nimportant to continue to increase nitrogen efficiency in production at the same time as the \namount of carbon in cultivated soil is kept unchanged or even built up. There is also a need for \nincreasing the utilisation of biomass for energy, but this should occur without it affecting \nfoodstuff production and other considerations towards the environment. Here it is in particular \nthe possibility of increased exploitation of waste and residual products and the cultivation of \nperennial energy crops.  \nThis demands new motivation for promoting a development that ensures both a reduction in \nemissions and an increased utilisation of biomass. There is a need for both research and \ninnovation to ensure that it is the correct solutions that are chosen and that they are sufficiently \ncost-effective. This should be supplemented by various initiatives towards the primary \noperations. Some of the elements that can be considered are:  \n  \n  A ban on operating practices that are especially CO2-emissive (e.g. cultivation of carbon-\nrich lowlands)  \n  Economic subsidies for establishing and operating CO2-friendly technologies (e.g. \nbiogas and direct sowing)  \n  Economic subsidies for CO2-friendly operations based on an overall operating \naccounting system for greenhouse gas emissions, where there are comparisons with \ntypical figures for the relevant production type  \n  Taxation of methane and laughing gas emissions from the individual farms, e.g. based on \nthe size and extent of the livestock production and the farm\u2019s nitrogen surplus  \n  \nAs it will be seen from the above, there are too few possibilities with the current technology for \nlimiting agriculture\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. A responsibility lies with the consumer to \nchoose climate-friendly food. Taxation of the particularly climate-hostile foodstuffs, such as \nmeat, milk, cheese and eggs, would be the most effective means. The proceeds from such \ntaxation could suitably be used to reduce the price of fruit and vegetables. There would also be \nconsiderable health benefits. \n  \nJ\u00f8rgen E.

Be-\nTestimony given in hearings before the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, \nU.S. Senate, One-hundredth Congress, first session, on the Greenhouse Effect and Global \nClimate Change, 9-10 November 1987. _ \nThe original publication of this paper provided an illustration that has not been included \nhere. This illustration depicts the monthly means and variances of the trace gases tri-\nchlorofluoromethane (CFC- I I, or CFCl5) , dichlorodifluoromethane (CFC-I 2 , CF2Cl2), \nmethyl chloroform (CH3CCl3), carbon tetrachloride (CCl4 ) , and nitrous oxide (N20) as \nmeasured at the Barbados station of the Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment. \n248 \nMETHANE, CFCs, AND OTHER GREENHOUSE GASES 249 \ncause solar radiation is absorbed continuously by the earth, it might be \nsupposed that its temperature should continue to increase. It does not, of \ncourse, because the earth also emits radiation, the spectral distribution \nof which is quite different from that of the incoming solar radiation. The \nhigher the earth's temperature, the more infrared radiation it emits. At a \nsufficiently high temperature, the total rate of emission of infrared \nradiation equals the rate of absorption of solar radiation. Radiative \nequilibrium has been achieved, although it is a dynamic equilibrium: \nabsorption and emission go on continuously at equal rates. The tem-\nperature at which this occurs is called the radiative equilibrium tem-\nperature of the earth. This is an average temperature, not the \ntemperature at any one location or at any one time. It is merely the \ntemperature that the earth, as a blackbody, must have in order to emit as \nmuch radiant energy as the earth absorbs solar energy. \nAll objects emit radiation continuously, mostly in the infrared region. \nSome of this radiation is absorbed by the atmosphere, which makes it \nwarmer than it would otherwise be. But the warmer the atmosphere the \nmore it emits to the ground, hence the ground is warmer than it would \notherwise be. The extent to which the atmosphere absorbs infrared \nradiation is, therefore, of great importance in determining the tempera-\nture of the earth's surface. If the atmosphere absorbs no infrared radia-\ntion, the average surface temperature would be well below freezing, \nabout 255 K (-18\u00b0C), and so would the air in contact with it. However, \nthe atmosphere does absorb infrared radiation, and as a consequence \nsurface temperatures are higher than they would otherwise be. This \nwarming of the atmosphere and earth's surface has come to be known as \nthe greenhouse effect. \nNot all atmospheric gases absorb infrared radiation to the same \ndegree. Indeed, the most abundant ones by far, nitrogen and oxygen, \nare the least absorbing. Of far greater importance are water vapor and \nmuch less abundant gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and ozone (03). \nThe atmospheric concentration of CO2 is about 350 parts per million by \nvolume (ppmv) and is increasing at a yearly rate of about 1 ppmv. [A \nplot of the CO2 concentration versus time is given in Figure 5 .1 in \nChapter 5.] Fossil fuel combustion is the major source of carbon \ndioxide. About 60% of the carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere \nwhile the rest is absorbed by the oceans or biosphere. Of major concern \nis whether the oceans and biosphere can maintain pace with carbon \n250 THE GREENHOUSE GASES \ndioxide production, thus keeping the fraction at 60%. If not, the yearly \nincrease in carbon dioxide will continue to rise. \nOne's first reaction about greenhouse contributions is that something \nlike CC12F2 (CFC-12), at levels of about 0.00045 ppmv and increasing \nannually at 0.00002 ppmv, would be trivial. However, as was previously \nmentioned, the greenhouse effect occurs through the absorption of \ninfrared radiation into specific vibrational frequencies of polyatomic \nmolecules in the atmosphere. Infrared radiation of the wavelengths \nwhich can be absorbed by CO2 vibrations are already exposed to \nabsorption by 350 ppmv of CO2 , and absorption by these vibrations is \nnearly saturated. Increasing the concentration to 351 ppmv will in-\ncrease the probability of absorption a little, but it is hard to increase the \ntotal absorption very much if it is already 99. 9%. On the other hand, \nthe amounts of CFC-12, CFC-11 (CC13F), CFC-113 (CC12FCC1F2), \nmethyl chloroform (CH3CC13), carbon tetrachloride (CC14 ), nitrous \noxide (N20), and methane (CH4 ) in the atmosphere are much smaller, \nand absorption in their vibrational frequencies is very far from satura-\ntion. Some of these absorptions happen to fall into infrared \"windows\" \nin which absorption by H20, CO2 , and 0 3 are all very weak or nonex-\nistent, and the individual molecules can be as much as 10,000 times \nmore effective in retaining infrared radiation than is the added CO2 \nwhen the latter concentration is already about 350 ppmv. When you \nconsider the effects from increasing concentrations of these halocar-\nbons, N20, CH4 , and tropospheric 0 3 , etc., the combined absorptions \nfrom increments in these gases over the past decade become approx-\nimately as important as the increment in CO2 in contributions to the \nanticipated overall greenhouse effect. \nINCREASING CONCENTRATIONS OF SELECTED TRACE \nGASES \nTrace gas concentrations in the atmosphere reflect, in part, the overall \nmetabolism of the biosphere, and the broad range of human activities \nsuch as agriculture, production of industrial chemicals, and combustion \nof fossil fuels and biomass. There is dramatic evidence that the compo-\nsition of the atmosphere is now changing, due to increased gaseous \nemissions associated with human activities. \nMETHANE, CFCs, AND OTHER GREENHOUSE GASES 251 \nDetailed measurements of various halocarbons have been conducted \nsince 1978 by a number of research groups throughout the United \nStates. Although the absolute concentrations of individual species may \nvary by as much as 10% between research groups, there is generally \ngood agreement concerning the overall trends. \nChlorofluorocarbons 12 and 11 are the most widely used CFCs at this \ntime. They are globally used in many and varying applications, some of \nwhich are as aerosol propellants, refrigerants, and foaming agents for \nplastics. Both CFC-12 and CFC-11 are increasing at about 5% per year \nand are now found in the atmosphere at concentrations of about 450 \nparts per trillion by volume (pptv) and 250 pptv, respectively. \nCarbon tetrachloride is used predominantly as a chemical intermedi-\nate in the production of CFCs 11 and 12, leading to relatively little \nemission of carbon tetrachloride to the atmosphere. A small fraction is \nstill used as a solvent in chemical and pharmaceutical production pro-\ncesses. Use as a grain fumigant is declining. The observed rate of \nincrease is about 2%, while the current atmospheric concentration is \nabout 130 pptv. \nStabilized methyl chloroform has been marketed since the early \n1960s. Its principal use has always been the industrial degreasing of \nmetallic or metaloplastic pieces. It is widely used for cold cleaning \nprocesses in the engineering industry. It is also used as a solvent in \nadhesives, varnishes, and paints where low flammability and low tox-\nicity are important. Sales of methyl chloroform grew rapidly in the \n1960s and early 1970s, when it replaced tri- and perchloroethylene and \ncarbon tetrachloride in many industrial applications. The atmospheric \nconcentration of methyl chloroform in 1987 is about 150 pptv and is \nincreasing at about 7 pptv per year. Global emissions for methyl chloro-\nform are actually higher than that of CFC-12 yet the overall rate of \nincrease is less. This reflects the difference in atmospheric lifetime \nbetween these two species, 110 years for CFC-12 and about 7 years for \nmethyl chloroform. The major removal process for methyl chloroform \nis by hydroxyl radical attack in the troposphere. The only known \nremoval process for CFC-12 is photolysis in the upper stratosphere. The \nreason methyl chloroform has a relatively short lifetime is due to its \ncarbon- hydrogen bonds. Thus, if the currently used CFCs are replaced \nby compounds which contain a hydrogen bond, the atmospheric life-\ntimes will be greatly reduced. \n252 THE GREENHOUSE GASES \nThe most recent addition to CFC monitoring among many research \ngroups is that of CFC-113 . This compound is used largely as a solvent \nto clean and deflux sophisticated electronic assemblies and components. \nIts future use is vulnerable to competing systems, changes in electronics \ntechnology, and possible requirements to reclaim the solvent. One can \nsee from the concentration versus time plot given in Figure 17 .1 that the \nlarge-scale use of this particular species began about the time regulation \nof CFCs 11 and 12 began in this country. Although this is a difficult \nspecies to accurately measure, the atmospheric concentration is about \n60 pptv and has a yearly increase of about 7 pptv. \nLike the CFCs, nitrous oxide has a long lifetime, about 150 years, \nFIGURE 17.1 \nAtmospheric Concentration of CFC-113: 1984-1987 \nPPtV CFC113 vs Year \n65.----r-\"\"T\"\"--r-,-..---r-\"\"T\"\"--r-,,--..---r--..---r-r--.....----.----.-~-T\"\"\"\"\"\", \n60 ..... ........ .... ... ... .... : ... ... .. ... ... .... ........... , , ...... .... ............ . \n55 .... ........ ... .. ....... .. , ... ...... .. .. ...... .. .. ..... . ; ... ...... ............. \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7:\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 .. \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7 \n. . . \n. . . \n. . . \n. . . \n. . . \n. . . \n. . . \n. . . \n. . . \n. . . \n..... . . . \n. . . \n. . . \n. . . \n. . . ~ 50 . . \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 .. ,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \n~ \nA-. \n45 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 :\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 -:\u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \n. . \n. . \n. . \n. . \n. . \n. . \n. . \n. . \n. . \n. . \n. . \n. . \n. . \n40 \n\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7=\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u2022i\u2022\u2022 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7\"\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \n35...._...L...--'---'---''--..,__-'--'---'---''--.L...-'--..L--'--L--...L........L.-1---'--'-:7, \n1984 1985 1986 1987 1988 \nYear \nConcentration vs. time. \nMETHANE, CFCs, AND 0rHER GREENHOUSE GASES 253 \nand is destroyed in the stratosphere. There nitrous oxide reacts with \noxygen atoms to form nitric oxide, which can catalyze destruction of \nozone. However, unlike the halocarbons, whose origins are unques-\ntionably industrial, nitrous oxide has mostly natural sources. Humans \nmay be increasing nitrous oxide emissions from soils by using ammonia \nand urea fertilizers. The added nitrogen eventually is returned to the \natmosphere, partly as nitrous oxide. Burning coal, which contains \norganic nitrogen compounds, is another anthropogenic source of ni-\ntrous oxide. The rate of increase observed for nitrous oxide is about \n0.3% or 1 part per billion by volume (ppbv). Currently, atmospheric \nlevels of nitrous oxide are at about 310 ppbv. \nThe final greenhouse gas to be discussed here is methane. Bacteria \nproduce .\u2713.-methane by anaerobic fermentation in wet locations where \noxygen is scarce: swamps, peat bogs, other natural wetlands, paddies, \nand the intestinal tracts of cattle, sheep, and termites. Oil and natural \ngas exploitation also may be a significant source. Studies of the car-\nbon-14 content of atmospheric methane indicate that at least 80% must \nhave biological origin. \nIncreases in atmospheric methane could be due to the greater amount \nof area devoted to rice cultivation or the increased number of cattle. \nHowever, increases in atmospheric methane may also be caused by \nrising levels of carbon monoxide from combustion processes. Both \nmethane and carbon monoxide are removed from the atmosphere \nlargely by reaction with hydroxyl radicals. With both gases competing \nfor a limited amount of hydroxyl, the average lifetime of a methane \nmolecule before it is destroyed may be getting longer. A plot of the \nmethane concentration versus time is given in Figure 17 .2. The current \nworld average concentration of atmospheric methane is 1. 685 ppmv, \nwhile the steady yearly increase observed is about 0 .016 ppmv, or \nabout 1 %. \nThe major removal of atmospheric methane occurs in the tro-\nposphere; however, about 10% drifts up into the stratosphere. Once \nthere, the methane is oxidized during which water molecules are \nformed. Two important routes exist for depositing water vapor into the \nstratosphere. The first is simply being carried upward as water rising in \nair; the second involves carrying hydrogen atoms upward in the chemi-\ncal form of methane, and then releasing them as the methane molecule \nis oxidized. In the 1980s atmosphere, these two processes deliver \n254 THE GREENHOUSE GASES \nFIGURE 17.2 \nAtmospheric Concentration of Methane: 1978-1987 \n1.7 \n1.6 \nCH4 \nPPMV \nBlake and Rowland \nOctober, 1987 \nGlobal Average \n16.5 PPBV/Year \n1.5 ~-~-~-~ __ ,___,___......__~-~--'---~-----' \n1978 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 \nYear \nConcentration vs. time. Growth in tropospheric mixing ratio of methane. \napproximately equal amounts of hydrogen to the stratosphere. However, \nwith atmospheric methane concentrations increasing at a rate of about \n1 % per year, the average amount of water vapor in the stratosphere is \npresumably steadily increasing with time. An increase in stratospheric \nwater vapor has a binary effect. Water itself is a greenhouse gas and, \nthus, increasing stratospheric water vapor levels will add to the overall \nglobal warming. Secondly, the more water vapor in the stratosphere, the \nmore water there is available to form polar stratospheric clouds, which \nhave been linked to the dramatic losses in ozone over Antarctica during \naustral spring. \nAll of the CFCs are not only very efficient at absorbing terrestrial \ninfrared radiation but also play a major role in transporting chlorine \natoms into the stratosphere where they can participate in the catalytic \ndestruction of the ozone layer. All of these gases have very long \nMETHANE, CFC's, AND OrnER GREENHOUSE GASES 255 \natmospheric lifetimes, about 110 years for CFCs 12 and 113, 75 years \nfor CFC-11, and about 50 years for the chlorocarbon CC14 \u2022 What this \nmeans is that these species drift around until they reach the upper \nstratosphere. During this lengthy journey, these compounds have been \nabsorbing outgoing radiation being emitted by the earth and redirecting \na large portion back towards the ground. Once these gases are high \nenough in the stratosphere they undergo another absorption, but this \ntime it is with solar ultraviolet radiation, during which a chlorine atom is \nejected from the remaining radical. At this point in time we switch from \na greenhouse problem to an ozone layer problem. However, because of \nthe extremely long atmospheric lifetimes for these halocarbons, they \nwill have contributed to the greenhouse warming for decades or even \ncenturies before their chlorine begins the catalytic destruction of the \nozone layer. \nCONCLUSIONS \nCarbon dioxide, halocarbons, nitrous oxide, methane, and many more \ntrace gases not mentioned here are all greenhouse gases that can lead to \nglobal warming. This warming is not just a theory but reality waiting to \nhappen. These gases also play a major role in determining stratospheric \nozone levels. With the unprecedented decrease in ozone above Antarc-\ntica in austral spring and recent statistical ozone studies indicating a \ndecrease in Northern Hemisphere ozone levels by as much as 3%, it is \nnot just a theory anymore. The gases that affect these two phenomena \nare rapidly increasing in atmospheric concentrations due, in part, to the \nextremely long lifetime of these species. At this point in time, there is \nno indication from the data being collected that the rate of increase for \nthese gases will decline significantly before the end of the century. The \nalready mentioned long lifetime of some of these gases means that even \nif all emissions to the atmosphere were completely halted today, many \nof these species would still be having an effect hundreds of years from \nnow, on global warming and the catalytic destruction of the ozone layer. \nTHE CHALLENGE OF \nGLOBAL \nWARMING \nEdited by \nDEAN EDWIN ABRAHAMSON Washington, D.C. \u25a1 Covelo, California \n\u00a9 1989 Island Press \nAll rights reserved.

E-mail address of presenting author*: carlos.freitas@embrapa.brIntroductionThe intensification of beef cattle production systems for recupera-tion of degraded pasture and increase animal support capacity in the Amazonia biomes has been showed how key strategy of Low Carbon Agriculture Plan (BRASIL, 2012). However, in 2012, N2O emissions of Brazilian Agriculture Sector were 541.2 Gg been 43% of direct emissions from pasture animal sector (BRASIL, 2013). The objective in this research is comparing the effect of nitrogen fertilization in the N2O emissions pasture management system under different densities of babassu palms.Material and MethodsThe experiment was installed in area of Campus IFMA, municipality of Codo, Maranhao State, coordinated Latitude 4\u00ba 29\u2019 20\u201d S and Longi-tude 43\u00ba 56\u2019 0\u201d W no period from March to July 2014. Total area of 12 hectares of Neossolo Quartzarenic under Mombasa grass divided into twenty-four plots been 0.5 hectare each. This research had two treatments: pasture management system with low density of babassu palms and pasture management system with high density of babas-su palms, beside an area of twenty hectares with babassu forest as reference area. The methodology of field work was based on PECUS Network protocols like this for characterization of soil carbon stocks 15N20 fluxes evaluation in pasture management system under different densities of babassu palms(Fernandes et. al. 2012) and for measuring gases fluxes Greenhouse soil (Zanatta et. al. 2014). DNDC model was applied for predicting the N2O emissions (UNIVERSITY 2012)Results and ConclusionsThe evaluation the daily N2O emissions in two steps (May/5/2014 and June/15/2014) indicated there is a tendency for decreasing the emis-sions in rainfall due the end of rainy season in both pasture manage-ment systems, see Table 1.Table 1. Daily N2O fluxes in pasture management systems under different densities of babassu palms.Treatments DayDaily N2O fluxes (g N ha-1day-1)N measured N predictedPasture management system with low density of babassu palms 133 3,77 174Pasture management system with high density of babassu palms 133 8,18 189Babassu forest 133 -0,03 1Pasture management system with low density of babassu palms 167 3,08 100Pasture management system with high density of babassu palms 167 6,33 103Babassu forest 167 0,00 116N20 fluxes evaluation in pasture management system under different densities of babassu palmsPasture management systems based absence N mineral fertilization present low N2O emissions. On other hand, conform was predicted by DNDC model, the application nitrogen fertilization in pasture manage-ment system with high density of babassu palms become the annual N2O emission rate bigger as management system with low density of babassu palms, see Table 2.Table 2. Annual N2O fluxes in pasture management systems under different densities of babassu palms.TreatmentsPasture management system with low density of babassu palmsPasture management system with high density of babassu palmsN2O fluxes (Kg N ha-1day-1)Annual N2O emission rate (%)N2O fluxes (Kg N ha-1day-1)Annual N2O emission rate (%)Fertilization (360 kg N) 5,03 1,4 6,22 1,73Fertilization (180 kg N) 3,34 1,9 3,91 2,17Fertilization (0 kg N) 0,47 0,0 0,28 0,00Finally, DNDC model was applied for evaluation N2O emissions of pas-ture management systems under different densities of babassu palms which over estimated daily N2O emissions that limited the its capacity to compare measured and modeled data how show the Figure 1.17N20 fluxes evaluation in pasture management system under different densities of babassu palmsFigure 1 Compare measured and modeled data of N2O emissions in pasture management systemsReferencesBRASIL, Minist\u00e9rio da Agricultura, Pecu\u00e1ria e Abastecimento.

As a result, the heating of the Earth\u2019s surface has been higher in the last three decades than recorded until 1950 (IPCC 2013). N2O is considered a very active gas in the process of global warming due to its high ability to absorb infrared radiation and is a sta-ble gas in the atmosphere, contributing approximately with 6% of the radiative potential of GHGs, and has a half-life of 120 years. Its global warming potential (GWP) is 310 times higher compared to CO2 and its concentration in the atmosphere has increased in recent decades, rea-ching 324,2\u00b10,1 ppb. This increase has been attributed to increased amounts of nitrogen fertilizers used in agriculture, conversion of forest areas for agriculture, increased fires, intensification of livestock, etc. (Bustamante et al. 2012). Thus, agriculture is the main activity respon-sible for N2O emissions to the atmosphere as a result of oxidation of organic matter and complex microbial processes associated with ma-nagement practices on ecosystems. Integrated production systems can be considered a strategy to reduce soil N2O emissions in the Brazilian Cerrado (Carvalho et al., 2014).19Edaphoclimatic factors and interactions with nitrous oxide emissions in integrated production systemsMaterial and MethodsThe study was conducted in the experimental field of Embrapa Cerrados, located in Planaltina, DF (15\u00ba35`30\u201d S, 14\u00ba42`30\u201dW and altitude 1007 m) from February 2012 to April 2014. The treatments consisted of four areas with different land use: a cultivated area with Eucalyptus urogran-dis in alley cropping, spaced 2 x 2 m between plants and 22 m between rows (ICLF); a cultivated area at full sunlight in absence of tree species (ICL); and two adjacent areas used as a reference: a native Cerrado and low productivity pasture. The ICL and ICLF areas consisted of experi-mental plots with 1.2 ha in a complete randomized block design with three replications. In March 2012, after soybean harvest, seeds of B. brizantha cv. BRS Piat\u00e3 were broadcasted immediately before sowing the sorghum to establish the intercropping system in the off-season growth. After harvesting the sorghum (July 2012), the pasture of B. brizantha was left to establish for the entrance of the livestock (cattle).Soil N2O sampling period was from February/2012 to February/2014. Three static chambers were placed in each plot, totaling 24 chambers in the integrated systems experiment (ICL and ICLF). For each referen-ce area (native Cerrado and continuous pasture) three chambers were installed. Each chamber consisted of a rectangular hollow metal frame (38 cm wide, 58 cm long, 6 cm in height) that was inserted 5 cm into the soil and a top polyethylene tray that was coupled and sealed to the base during gas sampling. The top of the tray contained a triple Luer valve for fastening the sampling syringes, thus allowing the removal of the gases at the time of sampling. The samples were collected and im-mediately transferred to 20 ml glass pre-evacuated vials (-80kPa). Gas sampling frequency was carried out, on average, three to four consecu-tive days a week during the rainy season, weekly during short period of drought during the rainy season, and biweekly during the dry season. In the rainy season, samples were collected 5 following days after nitrogen fertilizer applications. The analysis of N2O concentrations were performed at the Laboratory of Gas Chromatography of the Embrapa Cerrados, using a gas chromatograph.20Edaphoclimatic factors and interactions with nitrous oxide emissions in integrated production systemsIn addition to the gas sampling, soil samples were also collected at each gas sampling to determine the gravimetric water content, the con-centration of mineral forms of nitrogen in the soil (N-NO3- and N-NH4+), carbon and nitrogen microbial biomass and total carbon and nitrogen. Soil samples, composed of three sub-samples were collected at each plot at depths of 0-5 cm and 5-10 cm. The gravimetric soil water content was determined after drying soil samples at 105 \u00baC for 48 h. Based on these results and the bulk density, the percentage of WFPS was calculated, using the following formula: WFPS (%) = (gravimetric moisture (%) x bulk density) / total soil porosity x 100; Where: total soil porosity = [1- (bulk density / 2.65)], with 2.65 [g cm-3] is the density of the particles assumed soil. Nitrate (N-NO3-) and ammonium (N-NH4+) were analyzed following Embrapa (1997). Nitrogen microbial biomass (MBN) was determined with the method of chloroform fumi-gation-extraction and carbon microbial biomass (MBC) was determined according to Vance et al. (1987) and Wardle (1994). Basal respiration (BR) was estimated by measuring CO2 released from pre-incubated soil samples for a period of seven days. Total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) were analyzed according to Embrapa (1997).Pearson\u2019s correlation and multiple linear regression were used to cor-relate the cumulative emissions of N2O and the edaphoclimatic factors and soil properties.Results and ConclusionsThe dynamics of N2O emissions can be attributed to differences betwe-en the integrated systems, continuous pasture and native Cerrado, due to their environmental conditions. Thus, the covariables (NO3-, NH4+, WFPS and rainfall) correlate with the N2O fluxes with values less than 0.45, but highly significant (Table 1). In addition, all correlations were positive, reinforcing the relationship and direct influence that these covariables present with N2O fluxes. Among these factors, the WFPS was the most significant. Generally, high flows coincide with periods after precipitation, which was also observed by Ussiri and Lal (2013),21Edaphoclimatic factors and interactions with nitrous oxide emissions in integrated production systemsthereby providing the elevation of the WFPS. During this study there was good distribution of rainfall in the rainy season (October to April) with daily rainfall records higher than 40 mm. N2O emissions can be positively correlated with the availability of inorganic N as observed in his study (Table 1). The N-NO3- content showed higher correlation with N2O emissions than the N-NH4+ levels. Nitrification is the NH3 oxida-tion process for NH4+ or NO3- to under aerobic conditions, whereas de-nitrification is the process in which NO3- is reduced again to N2O and/or N2 under anaerobic conditions (Signor and Cerri 2013). The Cerrado soils are very aerated, providing conditions for nitrification, so that the processing reactions of NH4+ to NO3- occur more frequently. When the rainfall amounts elevate the soil WFPS above 60%, the denitrification becomes more intense, consuming NO3- in the soil and promoting more intense emission of N2O (Cameron et al. 2013).MBC and BR were significantly correlated with the emissions of N2O, whereas CBM showed a positive correlation and the BR, a negative correlation (Table 2). BR is a biological process resulting in the release of CO2 by microorganisms and parts of plants in soil, becoming more intense in conditions of increased O2 concentration in the soil (Moreira and Siqueira 2006). In this study, the largest BR values occurred in the dry season, a time when the lower humidity values were observed in the soil. Under these conditions, soil macropores are mostly filled with air, thus facilitating the diffusion of O2, and the micropores are partially filled with water, promoting the diffusion of soluble substrates. On the other hand, N2O emissions are mainly stimulated by increasing the avai-lability of water in the soil, since the main process for the production of N2O in the surface denitrification (Baggs and Phillipot 2010), justifying the negative relationship obtained between BR and N2O emissions.The significant correlation between MBC and N2O can be associated with the relationship between the microbial biomass and the quantity and quality of the biomass produced, the reflected vegetable waste decomposition process in the integrated systems evaluated.22Edaphoclimatic factors and interactions with nitrous oxide emissions in integrated production systemsTable 1.

Nowadays, researches are establishing relationships between grass production and gas emis-sion to figure out the better application N rates that harmonize produc-tivity and less environmental impacts, i.e., more efficiency of N uptake by plants (Bell et al., 2016). Thus, the goal of this work was to esta-blish the ratio between the amounts N2O emitted from soil to forage production in the Amazon of Mato Grosso.Material and MethodsThe study was carried out at Embrapa Agrosilvopastoral in Sinop / MT. The experimental period was 28 days, a cycle of grass growth to forage production. The experimental design was a randomized block with three replicates and five treatments. The grass Brachiaria brizan-tha cv. Marandu was subjected to different N rates: control (without application), ammonium sulfate 40 kg N ha-1, ammonium sulfate 80 kg N ha-1, urea 40 N kg ha-1, urea 80 kg N ha-1. The gas were sam-pling between 8 and 11 am daily during 15 days, and each 5 days until 28 days. Samples were collected in four times in an hour period (0, 20, 40, and 60 min) between 8 and 11 am in static chambers, 25Ratio of nitrous oxide (N2O) emission from soil to forage productivity in the Amazon of Mato Grossowhere four 20 mL aliquots were collected. The determination of the N2O concentration in the samples was performed in a Gas Chromato-graphy. The amount of N2O emitted (g ha-1) was divided by the forage productivity (Mg dry matter ha-1), creating a relationship, which was plotted in a graph in function of the N rates of ammonium sulfate and urea. To compare treatments was used standard error of the mean.Results and ConclusionsThe ratio between the amounts of N-N2O emitted (g ha-1) and forage accumulation (Mg of dry matter ha-1) during 28 days showed the bet-ter strategy to increase the forage productivity linked to N2O emission from soil (Figure 1). This ratio was similar independent of the N rate of ammonium sulfate. However, if compared to the treatment that no received N (control), applying 80 kg N ha-1 using urea as source led to a higher N2O emission per Mg of dry matter of forage, but it is simi-lar to that treatment which received 40 kg N ha-1. Comparing both N sources at a rate of 80 kg N ha-1, we observed lower N2O emission per Mg of dry matter with application of ammonium sulfate (Figure 1). These initial results to the Amazon of Mato Grosso indicate that applying ammonium sulfate at different rates does not increase N2O emission per Mg of dry matter of forage, so, the use of this fertilizer may increase forage productivity without emitting more N2O per unit of product in relation to pasture that does not receive fertilization.On the other hand, it is not true when is used urea at a rate of 80 kg N ha-1, because there is more N emission per forage production when com-pared to the control (no N supply). Urea at a rate of 40 or 80 kg N ha-1 are similar in the ratio, suggesting that the choice of a higher N rate does not increase the emission of this gas from soil to atmosphere per Mg of grass produced. If the application of N fertilizers to the grass Marandu is required at a rate of 80 kg N ha-1, the better choice in terms of decrea-sing N2O emission should be ammonium sulfate, which emits less than urea per Mg of dry matter of forage. Nevertheless, studies in this biome must advance to achieve a more representative relationship between N2O emissions and forage production of Marandu when applying N fertilizers.26Ratio of nitrous oxide (N2O) emission from soil to forage productivity in the Amazon of Mato GrossoFigure 1.

The application of nitrogen may greatly increase the production of forage since improves the availability of exchangeable N in soil. The minimum and maximum rate usually applied are 40 and 80 kg ha-1 of N (SOUZA et al., 2004).If on the one hand it promotes the growth of plants, on the other the nitrogen fertilization increases N2O emissions from soils. Hence, the increase in emissions because of this agricultural practice must be understood as it contributes to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, which are related to climate changes (RODRIGUES, 2006).Among the gases considered significant to global warming, the N2O is importance to agricultural systems because most global emissions of this gas are from processes occurring in the soil triggered by the N fertilization (Mosier et al., 2004). N2O has a global warming potential 310 times higher than CO2  (GWP - Global Warming Potential) (IPCC, 1997).The aim of this work was to measure the N2O emissions and to calculate the emission factors of two sources and two rates of N fer-28Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from soil cultivated with grass Marandu and subjected to rates and sources of N fertilizers in Amazon of Mato Grossotilizers in pasture of B. brizantha cv. Marandu in the Amazon of Mato Grosso.Material and MethodsThe study was carried out at Embrapa Agrosilvopastoral in Sinop / MT. The soil of the experimental area is classified as Oxisol, with 46% of clay and flat relief. The experimental period was 28 days, a cycle of grass growth, starting on January 13 and end on February 10, 2016. The experimental design was a randomized block with three replications and five treatments. The grass Brachiaria brizantha cv. Ma-randu was subjected to different N rates (N): (1) control (without appli-cation), (2) Ammonium sulfate 40 kg ha-1 of N, (3) Ammonium sulfate 80 kg ha-1 of N, ( 4) Urea 40 kg ha-1 of N, (5) Urea 80 kg ha-1 of N.The gas samples were taken daily in the first two weeks, starting two days before the application of the treatments. After two weeks of daily collections of gas samples, the sampling was made every 5 days to complete the 28-day cycle. The gases were sampling be-tween 8 and 11 am in static chambers, top-base model, where four 20 mL aliquots were collected in one hour intervals (0, 20, 40, and 60 min). The determination of the N2O concentration in the samples was performed on a Gas Chromatography.The N2O emissions were presented in graph as a function of time (days). For each day the data were compared by the standard error of the mean, and this calculation was also used to compare the daily average emissions. The emission factor for the period of 28 days was calculated using the cumulative emissions of such treatment, minus the accumulated emissions of the control treatment divided by the amount of N applied, multiplied by 100, to get value in percentage (%).29Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from soil cultivated with grass Marandu and subjected to rates and sources of N fertilizers in Amazon of Mato GrossoResults and ConclusionsN2O emissions were lower than 20 \u00b5g N m-2 h-1 before the application of treatments. After applying the fertilizer, the higher emission of N2O was observed in the treatment with urea at a rate of 80 kg ha-1 of N, increasing the emissions till the sixth day (Figure 1). Despite the hi-ghest absolute values of emissions, the application of urea at a rate of 80 kg ha-1 of N resulted in N2O emissions similar to ammonium sulfate in the same rate, with the exception only of the day January 18 and 22, in which the urea supply resulted in higher emissions.In general, although with higher absolute values emissions than the control, treatments with rates of 40 kg ha-1 of N showed emissions similar to the control over the study period, with few exceptions. From the day 27/01, as observed at the beginning of the assess-ments, emissions were similar for all treatments.Throughout the experimental period, the daily average flux of N2O of the treatments with nitrogen supply was higher compared to the control (Table 1), ranging from 18.98 to 29.91 \u00b5g N m-2 h-1 for am-monium sulfate supply, and 18.88 to 45.13 \u00b5g N m-2 h-1 for urea supply. In treatment without N application the daily average flux was lower than the other treatments:11.18 \u00b5g N m-2 h-1 (Table 1). Taking into account the standard er-ror of the mean it was observed that the increasing order of higher average daily emission follows the sequence: control; 40 kg ha-1 of N via urea and ammonium sulfate (similar); 80 kg ha-1 of N via ammonium sulfate; and 80 kg ha-1 of N via urea.In 28 days, the highest emission factor (0.19%) was observed with the application of urea at the rate of 80 kg ha-1 N, followed by ammonium sulfate at a rate of 80 kg ha-1 N, urea at a rate of 40 kg ha-1 of N, and ammonium sulfate at a rate of 40 kg ha-1 with values of 0.11%, 0.09% and 0.04%, respectively. These values are below the default 30Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from soil cultivated with grass Marandu and subjected to rates and sources of N fertilizers in Amazon of Mato Grossoemission factor used by the IPCC (1997) for inventory calculations. Thus, for the conditions of the Amazon of Mato Grosso recommends the revision of this factor.Therefore, regardless of source, treatments in which the N rates were lower proved more environmentally suitable in relation to the daily emissions of N20. The daily average emissions were higher at higher N rates, mainly when using urea as a source. However, future works should advance to correlate the emissions of N2O with forage yield in treatments with N rates and fertilizers in order to identify the best ratio productivity/emission.

PIAZZA2, Vander KAUFMANN2, Adilson PINHEIRO2IntroductionOn the 5th IPCC report stated that 95% of the increase in global average temperature being influenced by human actions. The paper also reports that the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmos-phere is currently around 400 ppm, the highest concentration in the last 800.000 years (IPCC, 2014). The main anthropogenic contribution is associated with the burning of fossil fuels, industrial activities, defo-restation and changes in land use, which in turn generate the gases causing the greenhouse effect, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), which is concentrating the atmosphere. The change in land use is the second largest emitter of greenhouse gases, evidenced in tropical areas due to deforestation and burning (PAIVA; FARIA, 2007).Brazil is the country with the largest area of tropical forest in the world, and the Atlantic Forest biome occupied 1,3x108 ha the country (RODRIGUES; MELLO, 2012). The Atlantic Forest is one of the biomes of Brazil that suffers most from the degradation, and the expansion of agriculture and livestock, added to industrial expansion and urbaniza-tion, the main decomposers. With these changes in land use, physical, chemical and biological properties are altered, causing negative im-pacts on biogeochemical cycles. In Brazil, the land use change ac-counts for 77% of CO2 emissions and the burning of fossil fuels only 18% (MIGUEZ; OLIVEIRA, 2010).Few studies have been done in Brazil related to fluxes soil-atmosphere CO2 in the Atlantic Forest (RODRIGUES; MELLO, 2012). This work aims to evaluate the differences of CO2 flux of soil atmosphere system in different land uses in the Atlantic Forest.33CO2 flux of soil-atmosphere system in different land uses in the Atlantic ForestMaterial and MethodsThe study was conducted in experimental watershed Concordia river, located in Lontras in Itajai Valley region in the state of Santa Catarina, Brazil. The watershed covers an area of 30.93 km2. The Concordia river is a tributary of the Lontras river which in turn is a tributary of the Itaja\u00ed river, main river watershed of the Itaja\u00ed-A\u00e7u. According to Thorn-thwaite classification, the region\u2019s climate is humid Mesothermal type B3 B\u20193 ra \u2018, no dry season defined and annual rainfall between 1800 and 2200 mm. The soils found in the basin are Cambisols (66.2%), Argissols (32.9%) and Gleysols (0.9%). The native forest (Ombrofilus Dense Forest) is predominant (45.11%), followed by pasture (17.54%), reforestation (16.77), agriculture (15.65%) and others (4.93%). Field campaigns carried out between the months of January to December 2015. The land uses were surveyed: pasture, agriculture, eucalyptus reforestation and native forest. The study was carried out on pasture on a natural field with perennial pastures (Paspalum notatum) with constant presence of animals. Agriculture area is occupied by the bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) in the summer and Oats Black cultivation (Avena strigosa) in winter as ground cover. For reforestation, an area with eu-calyptus cultivation was adopted (Eucalyptus grandis) with seven years old, planted with spacing 4 x 3 m. The native forest is the physiog-nomy of the Ombrofilus Dense Forest in medium to advanced regenera-tion stage. The method used for collecting samples of CO2 gas soil- atmosphere system flux was as Piva et al. (2014). The static chamber was comprised of two main parts: a base which is permanently fixed on the ground, and a chamber. The base is made of metal (10 x 39 x 49 cm) with a channel (5 x 5 cm). The chamber was built with transparent acrylic material (25 x 40 x 50 cm) and covered with 1 cm Izopor plates. Internally it was asked a fan to promote the homogeniza-tion of the gases. 1 Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Universidade Regional de Blumenau \u2013 ettotorres@gmail.com2 Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Universidade Regional de Blumenau.34CO2 flux of soil-atmosphere system in different land uses in the Atlantic ForestIn the chamber they were coupled spit thermometer and a silicone tube with three-way valve to collect the gases. The gas samples were col-lected in the period from 9 to 13 hours with the aid of syringes with Luer Lock nozzle, and the gas transferred to a vial of 40 mL identified. Vacuum was carried into the vial using a manual vacuum pump and applied -800 mBar. The data was collected at 0, 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes in order to check the linearity of concentrations. For each gas collection was noted the internal temperature of the static chamber and the temperature of the soil to 5 cm in depth. To quantify CO2 was Schimadzu using a gas chromatograph GC-17A Model equipped with flame ionization detector (FID) and Thermal Conductivity (TCD). The column used was 60/80 Carboxen 1000, with 5 m long and 2 mm stainless steel tube diameter. The injector temperature was 100\u00b0C, with injection in Splitless mode and injected volume of 250 uL using a syringe type Gastight\u00ae. The temperature of the TCD was 200\u00b0C with 40 mA. The FID temperature is 250\u00b0C. The carrier gas used was ar-gon with preset pressure of 220 kPa (6 min) min-1 kPa @ 230 kPa (19 min). The furnace temperature was 40 \u00b0C (6 min), 20\u00b0C min-1 220\u00b0C (20 min). The temperature was 375\u00baC methanator with H2 flow 50 ml min-1 and synthetic Air 300 ml min-1. Calibration curves were made at 5 points, respectively at concentrations of 50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 uL.As the gas was collected in 5 different time and temperature range between time 0 and 60 minutes was high, the concentration was cor-rected to NCTP using the equation C = Ca (P/1013)*(298/273 + T), where: C =concentration of fixed gas (ppm); Ca =concentration of the measured gas (ppm); P =the static pressure inside chamber (hPa); T =temperature inside the static camera (K). For quantification of the flow of CO2 gas soil-atmosphere system was using equation (adapted from JACINTHE, 2015) Fgas =(dC/dt)*(V/A), where: Fg\u00e1s =gas flow (mg CO2 m-2 h-1); dC/ dt = change of the gas concentration (ppm), between t0 and t1 (day); V =chamber volume (m\u00b3); A =area of the chamber (m\u00b2).35CO2 flux of soil-atmosphere system in different land uses in the Atlantic ForestResults and ConclusionsAssessing the CO2 flux of soil-atmosphere system in relation to land use, we realized that the biggest difference between the average CO2 flux of soil-atmosphere system for the year 2015 is between the Na-tive forest and Pasture, witch 70.19 mg CO2 m-2 h-1. The difference between the Native forest and Agriculture and Native forest and Re-forestation was 63.99 and 60.50 mg CO2 m-2 h-1, respectively. Thus, when we look at Figure 1, we see that the Native forest was responsible for the largest emissions of CO2 and the lower pasture. This may be related to the higher amount of organic matter in soil, mainly due to litter formed by the plant material remains and animal (CARNEIRO et al., 2014). Another factor that may be related is the higher moisture content in the first layers of the soil, also favoring microbial action (JACINTHE, 2015). As for the Pasture, a factor that may be related to lower CO2 stream are the physical characteristics of the soil and can infer the greater compression due to grazing animals, making the gas diffusion, as mentioned Jacinthe (2015) and a smaller contribution organic matter in the soil.Minor differences between the CO2 flow was between Agriculture and Pasture (6.20 mg CO2 m-2 h-1), Native forest and Pasture (9.69 mg CO2 m-2 h-1) and Agriculture and Native forest (3.49 mg CO2 m-2 h-1). The Agriculture and Native forest have greater dispersion in CO2 fluxes of soil-atmosphere system. This is possibly because they have a use of less conservative ground, with greater demand for water due crops, resulting in greater sensitivity to factors such as temperature, humidity and precipitation.020406080Forest x pasture Forest x agriculture Forest xreforestationAgriculture xpastureReforestation xpastureAgriculture xreforestationCO2Flux (mg m-2d-1 )Figure 1 - CO2 fluxes differences soil-atmosphere system between land uses.

PECUS project identified 23 typical production systems that represent most of the Brazilian beef cattle production and defined mathematical mo-dels for their technical and economic performance and CO2-e emis-sion intensity. Choosing the right performance indexes can help to compare different production systems and identify opportunities for improvement. This work describes a way of splitting emission intensity from enteric fermentation and manure decomposition of a beef cattle production system as  a product of performance ratios inspired by Du-Pont identity used for financial performance analysis (MATT, 2016). Selected production systems identified by the PECUS project were compared through these performance ratios in order to evaluate if they can help on identifying opportunities for the reduction of CO2-e emis-sion intensity.1            https://www.embrapa.br/busca-de-projetos/-/projeto/38213/projeto-da-rede-pecus38Beef Cattle CO2-e Emission Intensity as a Product of Performance RatiosMaterial and MethodsWe propose an identity for CO2-e emission intensity from enteric fermentation and ma-nure decomposition in CO2-e per Kg of carcass as the product of 4 performance ratios:emission intensity, carcass production (kg CO2-e / kg of carcass) =emission intensity, dry mass consumption        (kg CO2-e / kg dry mass consumed) *dry mass consumption (kg dry mass consumed / kg cattle live weight) *cattle turnover (kg cattle live weight / kg live weight for slaughter) *carcass yield (kg live weight for slaughter / kg of carcass)As in PECUS project, all values were calculated for one year of pro-duction, with all production systems assumed to be in a one year cycle (all variables repeat their values after 365 days). From the 23 typical beef cattle production systems defined by the PECUS project, 10 complete cycle production systems with negligible acquisition of animals were  selected, so the performance ratios proposed can be used to compare similar systems. The performance ratios were calcu-lated using mathematical models embedded in the \u201cModelo Emisso-es\u201d spreadsheet developed by the PECUS project, and normalized by dividing them by the minimum value found on the 10 systems evalua-ted. The normalized emission intensity is the product of the normalized performance ratios. The proposed equation is an \u201cidentity\u201d because the numerators and denominators on the right side of the equation may cancel each other   and become the expression on the left side. The last three performance ratios can be seen as a way of convert-ing emission intensity per carcass produced to emission intensity per dry matter consumed, using three efficiencies in cattle production, respectively: 1) using less dry matter for maintenance and producin-gan excess on live weight; 2) generating an excess of live weight for slaughter; 3) generating live weight for slaughter with a high percent-age of carcass. Although \u201ccattle turnover\u201d and \u201ccarcass yield\u201d would be better represented by the inverse of the performance ratios above, these 2 ratios were kept for simplicity (higher values imply proportional higher emission intensities).39Beef Cattle CO2-e Emission Intensity as a Product of Performance RatiosResults and ConclusionsValues in Figure 1 indicate that traditional and extensive systems have higher CO2-e emission intensities and that \u201ccattle turnover\u201d contri-butes more for the variation of emission intensity between systems, followed by \u201cdry matter consumption\u201d, in a distant second place. Little change of CO2-e emission intensity is explained by \u201cemission from dry matter consumption\u201d. The high values for this ratio for the \u201cPampa\u201d biome production systems come from higher protein con-tent estimated for the grass and the use of concentrate feed on that biome that leads to more N2O emission from manure decomposition. \u201cCarcass yield\u201d almost does not change between systems, and its normalized value barely influences the emission intensity of any pro-duction system. As the normalized \u201cemission intensity from dry matter consumption\u201d and \u201ccarcass yield\u201d ratios vary less between systems, there are probably less opportunities for reduction of emission inten- 2  become the expression on the left side. The last three performance ratios can be seen as a way of converting emission intensity per carcass produced to emission intensity per dry matter consumed, using three efficiencies in cattle production, respectively: 1) using less dry matter  for maintenance  and producingan excess on live weight; 2) generating an excess of live weight for slaughter; 3) generating live weight for slaughter with a high percentage of carcass. Although \u201ccattle turnover\u201d and \u201ccarcass yield\u201d would be better represented by the inverse of the performance ratios above, these 2 ratios were kept for simplicity (higher values imply proportional higher emission intensities).   Results and Conclusions Figure 1 shows the normalized CO2-e emission intensity (blue line, Y-axis on the right) and performance ratios (columns, Y-axis on the left) for each system per biome, from more traditional and extensive production systems to improved and intensive systems.

Caveat: the identity of the CO2-e emission intensity to a product of these four performance ratios does not imply that these ratios are orthogonal or independent from each other: a strategy for improving one performance ratio will probably have to consider the worsening of another. For instance, changing the forage may improve cattle turnover but increase emis-sion intensity per kg of dry matter consumed. The proposed perfor-mance ratios are easy to understand and to compare between sys-tems. Three of them evaluate technical efficiency and are reasonable proxies for economic performance. The Kaya identity used for global or regional GGE estimation by the IPCC (NAKICENOVIC & SWART, 2000; KAYA & YOKOBURI, 1997). Bennetzen (2016) also presents an exten-sion of Kaya identity for agricultural systems. These two identities have a much broader scope (regional and global GGE estimation) and are not so suitable for benchmarking production systems as the identi-ty here proposed. The identity proposed was applied only to complete cycle production systems. For production systems that buy or supply calves, the live weight for slaughter must be replaced by the yearly net gain of live weight. Besides enteric fermentation and manure decom-position, other emissions can be included in the \u201cemission intensity per dry matter consumption\u201d performance ratio, by extending its scope to emissions from dry matter (forage) production (liming, fertilizing, ensilage, agricultural operations, energy, infrastructure, equipment, land use change) and transportation (fossil fuel and vehicles). In a Life Cycle Assessment approach (ISO, 2006), the inclusion of  these \u201cupstream\u201d emissions would increase the influence of the dry matter source on the CO2-e emission intensity. These extensions to the sco-pe of the proposed identity must be evaluated.41Beef Cattle CO2-e Emission Intensity as a Product of Performance RatiosReferencesBENNETZEN, Eskild H. (2016).

In 2010 it was esti-mated that the emissions of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) were 13,133 and 521 Gg, respectively (BRAZIL, 2013). Pasturelan-ds contribute with N2O emissions, which vary with the adopted mana-gement and other variables.The types of management used in pastures may be distinct, with the extensive cultivation, in which there is no reseed or fertilization, and the intensive cultivation, with periodic fertilization and reseeding (HAN-SEN et al., 2014). The grazing method is an important mechanism in the production system, being potentially effective in providing answers to improve the productivity and sustainability of cattle pro-duction systems in pastures.Southeastern Brazil is a region with expressive production beef cat-tle. Grazing methods used in the country are commonly classified as continuous or rotational pasture. In the first one, animals have unin-terrupted access to the pasture area, during all the period grazing is allowed (ALLEN et al., 2011). Rotative pasture utilize grazing and rest periods between the paddocks. In this experiment, Nelore cattle grazed rotative pasture during 7 days, after which period the area rested 28 43Nitrous oxide emission in pasture under rotational and continuous managementsdays, totalizing a cycle of 35 days at the paddock.Mensuration of nitrogenous gas losses in tropical savanna are still scar-ce in literature, especially about nitrous oxide emission factors in soils with the addition of nitrogen fertilizer (SMITH, BOUWMAN, BRAATZ, 1999). This study aimed to quantify nitrous oxide emissions in pastu-res under two grazing methods, not fertilized and fertilized rotational, in Southeastern Brazil.Material and MethodsThis work was carried out between January 24 and March 19, 2014, corresponding to 56.7% of the rainy season in the summer, in a pasture of the experimental station of the Faculdade de Zootecnia e Engenharia de Alimentos, S\u00e3o Paulo University, located at 21o57\u00b4S-47o 28\u00b4W, 661 m altitude, in the municipality of Pirassununga, State of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. The climate is subtropical, according to Koppen--Geiger\u2019s classification, with annual precipitation of 1,300mm and mean temperature of 23\u00b0C, with a wet season distributed throughout the summer and a dry season in winter. However, in 2014, the precipitation in the period between January 24 to Decem-ber was 19.7% below the mean, with 1,043 mm. The soil in area is classified as red Ferralsol (FAO classification), with 31% clay in the top 20 cm.The determination of N2O emissions from Brachiara brizantha was made in two grazing methods: under rotational pasture (RP) and continuous pasture (CP). In RP, an area of 0.315 ha was used, where cattle of Nelore occupied for 7 days, and after this, the pasture rested for 28 days, completing a 35 days cycle of pasture in the plot, thus, the period of this experiment was of approximately two cycles in summer. In the first cycle, nine male animals, with average weight of 279.06 kg, and seven animals in the second, with average weight 44Nitrous oxide emission in pasture under rotational and continuous managementsof 304,29 kg.

The quantity used was of 18.9 kg, corresponding to 60 kg of N in 1 hectare, being one part of the area isolated by canvas, not receiving the addition of fertilizer. At the continuous grazing method, animals stayed in the paddock during the whole period. Three animals with mean weight of 274.4 kg were used in the beginning and 316.0 kg in the end of the second cycle.Gas sampling for soil N2O flux determination occurred in alternated days, using PVC chambers installed in the experimental plots, according to the chamber technique described by Davidson & Schimel (1995). The chambers are composed for a PVC base of 30 cm diameter and 20 cm height, a 10 cm deep lid containing a septum for the collection of gas and a leak. The bases were inserted in the soil to a depth of 3 cm.Twenty chambers were used to 15 sampling events, being eight of them to the fertilized treatment and four to not fertilized of rota-tional manure, and eight to the management of continuous pasture. Sampling were collected with 60 mL BD plastic syringe, and transfer-red to evacuated 12 to 20 mL LABCO vials. Embrapa Environment\u2019s Biogeochemistry and Trace Gases Laboratory, Jaguari\u00fana, SP, analyzed the sampling using a Shimadzu GC-2014 gas chromatogra-ph, equipped with an electron capture detector (ECD) and a flame ionization detector (FID). Soil N2O flux was calculated according to Jantalia el at. (2008).Results and ConclusionsThe accumulated precipitation in the studied period was 141.8 mm, of the total 299.4 mm registered in the summer season, 66% below the summer of the year before, when 905 mm were registered. The mean temperature was 25.2\u00b0C, according to USP (2016). Figure 1 presents precipitation and temperature data to the summer season.45Nitrous oxide emission in pasture under rotational and continuous managementsIn the fertilized pasture, the minimum N2O emission occurred on February 3, with a rate of 0.007 mg N-N2O m-2.day, after one week without raining, and the maximum, on February 25, with 5.295 mg N-N2O m-2.day, and occurrence of two consecutive days of rain, totalizing 24.4 mm. Not fertilized pasture had the minimum emission of 0.007 mg N-N2O m-2.day, also on February 4, and maximum on March 12, with 0.804 mg N-N2O m-2.day, with 14.4 mm of accumulated rain to the day before and the day of sampling. In the continuous grassland,  minimum emission occurred on February 11, with 0.007 mg N-N2O m-2.day, after 14 days without raining, and maximum, on February 25, as observed at the fertilized field, with 4.348 mg N-N2O m-2.day.Emission pulses of N2O in the summer season were driven by the raining events, as observed by others authors (XU et al., 2002; SIGNOR et al., 2013; LIU et al., 2014; ROWLINGS et al., 2015). The cumulated emissions for the fertilized pasture were 33.328 mg N-N2O m-2.day, while at not fertilized pasture were 5.863 mg N-N2O m-2.day and at the continuous management pasture were 19.153 mg N-N2O m-2.day.Figure 1.

In agriculture, the most cost-effective mitigation options are cropland management, grazing land management, and restoration of organic soils. This work contributes with information concerning soil gaseous emissions from a managed farm system in the Campan\u00e1rio Settlement at S\u00e3o Gabriel do Oeste (MS). The food production system comprises the integration of swine-forestry-soya/corn (cattle was expected but not effectively implemented) regularly fertilized with standard NPK. The experiment consisted of additionally applying swine effluent of biodigester as an organic fertilizer with known doses (measured, not shown) in sites with arrangements of forestry mixed with agriculture (soya/corn rotation).Material and MethodsThe site description is available elsewhere e.g. Buller et al. (2015). In fieldwork, it was obtained a total of 1105 chamber flux measurements distributed in 36 sites between 26/Sep/2013 and 4/Jun/2014 mostly in the morning (Figures 1 and 2).49Gaseous fluxes in Oxisol soil surfaces at integrated plant-livestock systemsThe measurements were made on site with a plexiglass closed chamber connected by tubing to a Lumasense Innova 1412 photoacoustic systems with optical filters for measuring carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), ammonia (NH3), Sulfur dioxide (SO2), and methane (CH4). It was possible to recalibrate CO2, N2O and CH4 with a GC/SRI-FID/ECD and a Los Gatos Inc. UGGA. Unrecalibrated SO2 and NH3 data is presented for insightful interrelationships. Data in Figure 2 represent for each gas species (g) the site-specific medians (medsg) normalized (medng) by the all sites medians (medag) and interquartile ranges (irag) as medng = (medsg \u2013 medag)/irag. Figure 3 shows interrelationships among median fluxes per site (n = 36 median values).Results and ConclusionsIn general, gaseous fluxes showed large variability likely due to local and temporal effects (Figure 2).Fig 1.

Figure 2 presents normalized flux variability in spatial terms. CO2 fluxes were higher than overall median particularly in forested sites (C and G), independently of effluent application (Kruskall Wallis test p = 0.010, n = 36).Unsurprisingly, N2O fluxes were higher than overall median particularly in sites that received swine effluent (Kruskall Wallis test p = 0.012, n = 36).

Ruminants, due to enteric fermentation, are known important sources of methane (CH4) emis-sions into the atmosphere. The carbohydrate digestion process by the-se animals generates, physiologically, CH4 as a metabolic by-product (CUNNINGHAM; KLEIN, 2008).Several alternatives to reduce methane emissions by ruminant digestion are studied, mainly linked to changes in diet.The increase in the worldwide demand for palm oil and its applica-tion in biodiesel production have generated waste in agro-industries and allowed greater availability of co- products for animal feed (BRINGEL et al., 2011). Palm kernel cake\u2019s chemical composition features protein, energy, and fiber contents that may supply ruminants with part of their nutrient needs. In the Brazilian state of Par\u00e1, palm kernel cake is available throughout the year at low cost for rural 54Enteric Methane Emission of Female Buffaloes Supplemented with Palm Kernel Cake in the Amazon Biomeproducers compared to other supplements employed in diet (corn, soybean, and wheat). The introduction of cakes with high fat content into ruminant diets may aid in mitigating enteric methane emissions (ABDALLA et al., 2007).Thus, in face of the concern about global warming and the effi-ciency of diets, this study aimed to assess the levels of inclusion of palm kernel cake on enteric methane production among female buffalo-es in the Amazon.Material and MethodsThe trial was carried out at the animal research unit \u201cSenador \u00c1lvaro  Adolfo,\u201d belonging to Embrapa Eastern Amazon, in the city of Bel\u00e9m-PA, Brazil. The study area features Af2 climate (MARTORANO et al., 1993) with mean rainfall above 60 mm in the least rainy month and annual rainfall around 2,900 mm. The study was certified  by the Animal Ethics Committee - CEUA under protocol 007/2015. 24 crossbred Murrah and Mediterranean female buffaloes with initial age and weight of 34 months and 514 \u00b1 69.88 kg, respectively, belonging to Embrapa Eastern Amazon\u2019s experimental herd were used. The female buffaloes were supplemented during September and October 2015. The experimental treatments consisted of supplementing the female buffaloes with palm kernel cake at the following inclusion levels  in  relation  to  their body weight  (BW):  0% (T1) (control), 0.25% (T2), 0.50% (T3) and 1.00% (T4). The research adopted a completely randomized design with four treatments and six repetitions considering each animal as an experimental unit. The diets at every inclusion level were added with 0.15% (BW) wheat bran, which acted as a palatability agent. The chemical composition of the ingredients is presented in Table 1. Corn silage (CS) was used as roughage. The animals were managed in confinement in individual pens and underwent 21 days of adaptation to the experimental diets with free access to water and mineral mix. The diet was provided to the animals twice a day (8 AM and 5 PM). The amounts of CS 55Enteric Methane Emission of Female Buffaloes Supplemented with Palm Kernel Cake in the Amazon Biomeoffered were weighed daily and adjusted according to the animals\u2019 intake to result in daily leftovers of 10%.Methane emission was assessed using the sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) tracing gas technique according to the methodology described by Johnson et al. (1994). Samples were collected every 24 h for five consecutive days. The animals were removed from the pens at 7:30 AM and taken to the management corral, where the samples were collected. The collecting yokes were taken to the laboratory, where the samples were diluted with pure nitrogen gas prior to the analyses.

Daily enteric methane emission was lower in the treatment with palm kernel cake inclusion of 1.00% BW (27.65 kg.year-1), showing values lower than those observed in the IPCC (2006), which estimated the emission in buffaloes at 55 kg.year-1. The animals that were not fed palm kernel cake emitted greater amounts of CH4 (214.12 g.day-1). Including palm kernel cake in the diet of female buffaloes at over 0.50% BW was negatively correlated (r = -0.51; P<0.01) with enteric methane production, i.e., the level of lipid offered in the experiment led to the lowest enteric methane emission.

Nonetheless, the characteristics of some N fertilizers and some application methods may cause N losses, reduced profits and environmental problems (VITTI et al., 1999).Urea is the most used N fertilizer due to its high N content and lower cost compared to other N sources but concerns exist with potentially high losses via ammonia (NH3) volatilization, which may reach up to 80% of the N applied (ROCHETTE et al., 2009). Some forms of urea application, like incorporation into the soil, may reduce NH3 volatilization  but in no-till farming and in normal pasture management the fertilizer is topdressed, what may result in up to 78% loss of NH3 (LARA CABEZAS et al., 2000).This study aimed at evaluating N losses, via NH3 volatilization, in 59Quantification of Ammonia Volatilization in Pastures of Integrated and Non-Integrated Beef Cattle Production Systemspastures under different managements to better understand important beef cattle production systems in Brazil and improve the efficiency of N fertilization.Material and MethodsThe study was carried out at Embrapa Pecu\u00e1ria Sudeste, SP (21\u00b057\u201942\u201dS,  47\u00b050\u203a28\u00bb W, 860 m) from 18/01/2014 to 02/09/2015. The climate is classified as Cwa (K\u00f6ppen), with two well defined seasons: dry season - April to September, with average temperature and precipitation of 19.9\u00baC and 250 mm, respectively; rainy season - October to March, with average temperature and precipitation of 23.0\u00baC e 1,100 mm, respectively. The soil in the area is classified as dystrophic red yelow Latosol. Ammonia volatilization was evaluated in pastures belonging to five production systems: 1) Intensive (INT) - dryland rotational grazing system; 2) Integrated Silvopastoral System (SP) - rotational grazing with eucalyptus trees (15 x 2 m spacing); 3) Integrated Crop-livestock System (CL) - rotational grazing system with crop rotation in each paddock in four year cycles (three years with pasture and one year with corn); 4) Integrated Crop-livestock-forestry System (CLF) - the same as CL with eucalyptus trees (15 x 2 m spacing); 5) Extensive (EXT) - continuous grazing system. Soils in EXT and in an adjacent area of Atlantic Forest were used, respectively, as negative and positive controls.Pastures in INT, SP, CL and CLF were established in 2012 with Urochloa (sin. Brachiaria) brizantha (Hochst ex A. Rich.) Stapf cv. Piat\u00e3 and were fertilized with 50 kg of N ha-1 year-1 via urea. Each of these systems had two replicate pasture areas, of 3 ha each, divided in six paddocks in a rotational system with six days of occupation and 30 days rest. The  pasture in  EXT  was  established  in 2007  with  Urochloa  (sin. Brachiaria) decumbens(Stapf) R. Webster and was not fertilized. The EXT system had two pasture areas of 2,85 ha each managed under continuous grazing. 60Quantification of Ammonia Volatilization in Pastures of Integrated and Non-Integrated Beef Cattle Production SystemsThe stocking rate was adjusted in all pastures using the \u201cput and take\u201d technique (Mott and Lucas, 1952) and visual evaluation of forage availability.Volatilization of ammonia was evaluated following the procedure by Alves et al. (2011). Collectors were composed of 8 \u00d7 8 cm foam (density of 0.02 g cm-3) pads soaked with 10 ml of phosphoric acid solution (0.5 N). Each foam pad was placed over a polyvinyl chlori-de (PVC) plate (10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 0.2 cm) and wrapped with one layer of polytetrafluoroethylene tape (PTFE), which is permeable to ammonia and impermeable towater. The foam pads were placed 1 cm above the soil surface with the PVC plate on the upper side, to restrict the collection of NH3 to that originated in the soil. Foams were changed every day during five days and, subsequently, in three days intervals until the 23rd day. Ten collections were done during the experimental period. In each collection day, the foams were put in individual plastic bags, sealed and stored in a freezer. For analysis, the foams, the PVC plates and the PTFE tapes were washed with approximately 300 ml of deionized or distilled water inside a B\u00fcckner funnel attached to a Kitassato and a vacuum pump. A 50 ml sample was than collected and analyzed by Flow Injection Analysis (FIA).Results and ConclusionsAccumulated N-NH3 losses (Figure 1A) were similar (P>0.05) in INT, SP, CL and ALF pastures (average of 11.8 kg ha-1), corresponding to 23,6% of the N applied. Ammonia losses were similar in the EXT pasture and in the forest (average of 4.6 kg ha-1) but much lower than in the intensively managed pastures, probably because no N was applied.61Quantification of Ammonia Volatilization in Pastures of Integrated and Non-Integrated Beef Cattle Production SystemsDespite the similarity in accumulated NH3 losses obtained in INT, SP, CL and CLF, the flux of NH3 volatilization, after N fertilization, was di-fferent among these systems (Figure 1B). The maximum levels of rate volatilization occurred latter in the pastures with trees (SP and CLF) compared to those without trees (INT and CL). Similar results were obtained by Santana et al. (2011) who observed that the length of time it takes to occur 90% of urea hydrolysis is longer in soil under eucalyptus forest than in soils in pastures and in areas of no- till and conventional crop production, what may be related to the amount of organic residues present in the soil.ConclusionsTotal ammonia volatilization from the soil is similar in integrated and non-integrated beef cattle production systems and higher than in ex-tensively managed pastures and forests. The daily rate of volatilization is affected by the presence of trees in the pastures. Pastures in INT, SP, CL and CLF were established in 2012 with Urochloa (sin. Brachiaria) brizantha (Hochst ex A. Rich.) Stapf cv. Piat\u00e3 and were fertilized with 50 kg of N ha-1 year-1 via urea.

The corn crop, according to CO-NAB (2015), the 2014/15 agricultural year was the second summer crop in terms of higher productivity (5382.0 kg ha-1) and planted area (15743.7 ha).The N2O, although in smaller amount in the atmosphere when com-pared to CO2, has potential of retention infrared radiation 310 times higher (MCTI, 2013). In the agriculture the emissions of this gas are given by complex microbial processes associated with human manage-ment practices on ecosystems (FAO, 2014), nitrification and denitrifi-cation reactions, which are the main regulators of the release of N2O. These processes are highly influenced by mineral or organic nitrogen fertilizer, plants fixing atmospheric N or application of animal waste.The great current challenge is to reduce the N2O emissions associated with nitrogen fertilization in cereals. According to the IPCC, 1% of the N applied to the soil via fertilizer ends in the atmosphere as N2O. In view of this, there are several studies that suggest that biochar can play a positive role in reducing emissions of N2O. The biochar, organic matter carbonized under poor atmosphere in oxygen (pyroly-sis) whose purpose is agricultural use, aimed at the carbon capture in the soil and the improvement of their physical and chemical proper-64Nitrous Oxide Emission of Fertilizer Nitrogen with Biocharties (Sohi, 2012), was considered by Fox & Chapman (2011) one of the nine most viable strategies to mitigate global warming.Biochar influences N2O emissions from soil due influence on the dy-namics of nitrogen(N) in the soil, affecting the availability of N to microbial action by the use of soil biochar (Clough et al., 2013), reducing the substrate of nitrification and denitrification reactions. The high ratio of C / N of biochar can favor N microbial immobilization (Cayuela et al., 2013th), in this sense the soil conditioning biochar residue derivative with low C / N ratio generates an increased release of N emanated from biochar (Cayuela et al., 2013b). Also, may occur a decrease in the availability of mineral N as result of an increase in the adsorption of NO3- and NH4+ (Yang et al., 2015). Another mechanism assists in mitigating N2O emissions is the increase of reductive activity provided by functional groups of biochar, leading to greater efficiency of denitrification emitting thereby N2 (Cayuela et al., 2015). Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of the application of biochar in mitigating N2O emissions associated with nitrogen fertilizer on crops.Material and MethodsThe study was conducted at the Experimental Station of the Fede-ral University of Parana State (UFPR) in Pinhais - PR. The climate is subtropical humid mesothermal (Cfb), according to Koppen (SIMEPAR, 2015). The soil is classified as Cambisol (Sugamosto, 2002).The experiment was implemented in December 2015 with the corn planting (Zea mays L.) grown under no-tillage in the straw. The nitrogen fertilizer (urea - CO (NH2) 2) was divided into two applications, 30 kg N ha -1 at planting and the rest in coverage (170 kg N ha -1). Each plot was 20 m2  (4.0 x 5.0 m), with 5 rows of planted corn.65Nitrous Oxide Emission of Fertilizer Nitrogen with BiocharThe experimental design was randomized blocks, with five replications allocated in an experimental area with 20 plots (20 m2). The experi-ment consisted of four nitrogen fertilization treatments in coverage of maize (corn V6 stage) and associated with the application of biochar: A) application of nitrogen fertilizer in the open furrow in the plan-ting spacing (NF); B) application of nitrogen fertilizer to haul (NH); C) application of nitrogen fertilizer mixed with biochar, both in the open furrow in the planting spacing (BNF) and D) application of nitrogen fer-tilizer mixed with biochar, both haul (BNH) .The biochar applied to the soil is from pyrolysis of wood chips eucalyptus (eucalyptus spp.).Assessments of emissions started in December 2015, the first just before the planting of corn and the others post-planting. In order to characterize the experimental area, there was gas collection just before the planting of corn (12.08.2015) and after 3, 13 and 46 days, totaling 4 collections. After the treatments (21/01/2016) occurred five collections: 2, 4, 7, 9, 11, 14 and 18 days after that date. Samples of gas were collected applying the method of the static closed chamber taken at times 0, 20, 40 and 60 minutes after closing the chamber. Each collection began at 09:00 am. Emitted gas samples were collected from the corn planting line (L) of separately of the emitted gas from of interlineation (I), allowing the performance evaluation of the gases in function of the location of the treatments in the experimental  area. The analyzes of the air samples were by gas phase chromatography by GC equipment - Trace 1310.Results and ConclusionsThe largest N2O emissions occurred 18 days after treatments (AAT) for all treatments when evaluated in the planting spacing (Figure 1). On this date the soil with BNF showed an emission 21.6 % lower than the soil with NF. However, when the treatment was applied to haul the soil with only nitrogen (317.47 ug m-2 h-1) had a lower flow than the soil with biochar (317.47 ug m-2 h-1).66Nitrous Oxide Emission of Fertilizer Nitrogen with BiocharRegarding the evaluations carried out in the row, was observed a peak in emissions of N2O 13 days after planting (AP) corn ( Figure 1). Another rise in flows occurred at 18 days AAT, being the soils with NF and BNF presented a lower emission of this gas. Still, the administration of nitrogenous fertilizer haul associated with biochar resulted in an emission27.2 % higher in relation to employment just of nitrogen in the soil.The peak observed only in the evaluations in the planting line to 13 days AP, is due to fertilizer applied at sowing time near the line of planting corn, not influencing emissions in the planting spacing. This effect is commonly observed in post-management period, since it is characterized by an elevation of the mineral nitrogen present in the soil of the previous crop residues and nitrogen fertilization (Zanatta, 2009).The spatial arrangement of mineral nitrogen in the experimental area was reflected in N2O fluxes observed. Prior to treatments (topdres-sing), only in the planting row there was an emission peak in agre-ement with the absence of fertilizer in the planting spacing.

With a natural capacity for beef cattle, especially for phase creates. The Pantanal has numerous fields of native grasslands and mixed pastures, represented by a mixture of cultivated pastures in the high parts of the land (Uroclhoa humidicola common and Llanero) and native pastures in the low and humid parts. Differences in forage supply and diet quality lead to changes in intake and as a result in the emission of methane. Individual data of methane emission fluxes need to be related to food intake for better interpretation of the systems, and for an appropriate systemic evaluation is necessary to consider the production efficiency, considering this way all of a calf production cycle, as refers to the Pantanal creates systems. This study aimed to compare the individual emissions of heifers in native or mixed pastures of the Pantanal.Material and MethodsTwelve heifers were divided into two treatments with six replicates, and allocated in paddocks with native or mixed pastures, of the Experimental Farm Nhumirim (Embrapa Pantanal). It was administered orally one capsule containing sulfur hexafluoride gas (SF6) of known and constant release in the rumen of each heifer, to serve as a tracer 70Nellore heifers methane emissions in native and cultivated pastures of the Pantanal at the dry season.gas in the methane emissions estimates, according to the technique described by Johnson et al ., 1994. The samples for methane emission measures and intake of dry matter (DM), were carried out between August 24 and September 12, 2014, and the animals were subjected to prior adaptation of 14 days. The fecal output (FO) was estimated by indicator titanium dioxide (20g / animal / day) by a relationship between the daily amount administered and the amount found in the faeces. The degradability data were determined by the method of in situ digestibility (Orskov et al., 1980) after incubation for 240 hours. For intake estimates applied to the inverse  relationship between the FO and the indigestible forage. Issued methane values were divided by the average intake for estimating the emission per kg feed. It performed preliminary analysis of the distribution of data in order to use the tests, parametric (Student\u2019s t test) and nonparametric (Kruskal-Wallis test) averages.Results and ConclusionsMethane emissions when expressed per animal / day were lower (P <0.05) in native pastures, while emissions per kg feed did not differ (P> 0.05) between treatments (Table 1). Fecal excretion of animals was greater in animals on mixed pasture (P <0.05) associated to the greater digestibility of the diet led to increased intake (P <0.05) (Table 2), and consequently the equal (P>0.05) in emission of methane consumed per kg of forage consumed (Table 1).

BR 153 km 633, Bag\u00e9/RS, Brasil.E-mail address of presenting author*: leandro.volk@embrapa.brIntroductionThe Pampa Biome occurs in just 2.07% of Brazilian territory, but in Rio Grande do Sul state occurs in 63% (176,496 km2) of gaucho territory. Is characterized by predomination of natural grassland with shrubs and tree vegetation in mosaic (Campos). Because of the natural grasslands, livestock production is one of the main economic activities. Despite of the potential of mitigation, the society has paid attention in this livestock production system, mainly in your environmental impact, and greenhouse gas emissions. In addition to the sporadic deferral and stocking rate adjustment, other alternative practice to make more productive this livestock system (in Campos) is fertilizer application, and hibernal forages sowing (Overbeck et al, 2007; Boldrini, 2009; Nabinger et al, 2009). The objective of this work was evaluating the nitrous oxide emissions from soil with natural grassland under different intensifications rates in two seasons (winter and summer).Material and MethodsThe work was conducted at Embrapa Pecu\u00e1ria Sul (Bag\u00e9/RS, Brazil), in two seasons (August- September 2014 and February-March 2015). The soil is classified as a sandy clay Luvisol (Soil Taxonomy) or Luvissolo \u00d3rtico h\u00e1plico t\u00edpico (Brazilian System of Soil Classification \u2013 Embrapa, 2006). The experimental area has 61 ha with 3 treatments 76Nitrous oxide emissions from soil of natural grassland under differentintensifications in Pampa biome(3 repetitions): natural grassland (CN); natural grassland improved by fertilization (CN+A); and natural grassland improved by fertilization and introduction of exotic season species ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) and red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) (CN+A+F). The CNT treatment - natural pasture with traditional management without stocking rate adjustment - was conducted in neighboring adjacent area with the same soil. During all experiment time, the area was grazed by Hereford steers with forage offers of 12 kg/ 100 kg of live weight. In the days 25/08/2014 and 23/02/2015, were applied equivalent doses of 300 kg/ha of diammonium phosphate (DAP), at the treatments CN+A and CN+A+F. The N2O emission rates were measured in situ regularly with static cameras (4 cameras by repetition) and the soil temperature was checked to 5 cm depth. Gas from the chamber was collected with a 20 mL polypropylene syringe (Costa et al, 2008). The gases were measured in Geochemistry Soil Laboratory (UFRGS) with a Gas Chromatography (Shimadzu GC-2014 model Greenhouse) equipped with an electron capture detector (ECD).Results and ConclusionsThe soil temperature at 5 cm depth fluctuated between 10.5 \u00b0C and 16 \u00b0C in winter (Figure 1a) and between 24.5 \u00b0C and 26 \u00b0C in summer (Figure 1b). The N2O flow rates measured at the first and last day of each experimental period were very low and similar to those observed by Godoi et al (2016) under similar conditions (Figure 2). The treatments that received fertilizer application (CN+A and CN+A+F), the largest N2O emission rates occurred 7 days after application of DAP, independent of temperature differences in the soil (Figure 1) and the season. The highest values of N2O emission rate were observed in summer (103 \u00b5gN2O m-2h-1 in average between two fertilized treatments), while in winter the highest values were lower (20.5 \u00b5gN2O m-2h-1 in average between two fertilized treatments). The treatments without fertilization (CN and CNT) had very low levels of N2O emission rate, both in winter and in summer.77Nitrous oxide emissions from soil of natural grassland under differentintensifications in Pampa biome season. The highest values of N2O emission rate were observed in summer (103 \u00b5gN2O m-2h-1 in average between two fertilized treatments), while in winter the highest values were lower (20.5 \u00b5gN2O m-2h-1 in average between two fertilized treatments). The treatments without fertilization (CN and CNT) had very low levels of N2O emission rate, both in winter and in summer.  Figure 1. Soil temperature at 5 cm depth in the sampling dates.

At this stage usually the animals lose weight, which can compromise their development in the following period. This activity is also aimed to cause great impact on the environment, especially the issue of en-teric methane emission and in deforested areas. The objective of this study was to evaluate the weight development and the emission of enteric methane by crossbred steers (Curraleiro P\u00e9-Duro x Nellore).Material and MethodsThe study was performed during the dry season 2015 in the expe-rimental field of the Federal Institute of Maranh\u00e3o (IFMA), Campus Cod\u00f3-MA, located in the Amazon biome in 04\u00ba 27 \u201819\u2019 \u2018South and 43\u00ba 53\u2019 08 \u2018\u2019 West, altitude of 47m. We used two different areas in grazing, the first consisting of grass Mombasa and Babassu palm trees (80 trees per hectare) and the second area only by \u201cMomba-80Growth and enteric methane emission evaluation of cattle in livestockforestintegration system in the Amazon biome in the dry period\u00e7a\u201d grass (Panicum maximum Jacq. cv Momba\u00e7a), in full sun. Each system consisted of seven paddocks of 4200 m\u00b2 each, in rotation. The entrance and exit of the animals was determined by the height of the \u201cMomba\u00e7a\u201d grass (80 cm at the entrance, and 40 cm at the exit). The present study used twelve contemporaries steers (crossbred steers Curraleiro P\u00e9-Duro x Nellore) supplemented with mineral salt and fresh water. Evaluation of growth was determined by monthly weighing on electronic scales.The enteric methane was determined with sulfur hexafluoride tra-cer technique according to Johnson & Johnson (1995) and adapted in Brazil by Primavesi et al. (2004). The eructated and      expi-red      gas      was      collected      daily       in       five       consecu-tive      days. The concentrations of CH4 and SF6 were determined at the laboratory of Embrapa Meio Ambiente, located in Jaguari\u00fana , S\u00e3o Paulo state, Brazil, by gas chromatograph (HP6890) equipped with flame ionization detector (FID) and megabore column (0.53 uM, 30 m) HP- Al/M Plot (for CH4) and electron capture detector (\u00b5-ECD) and megabore column HP- MolSiv (for SF6), with two loops 0.5 cm3 coupled to two six-way valves.Analysis of the available forage was performed according to \u201cAgro-nomic technique zero cut\u201d (Lopes  et  al.,  2000).   We  analyzed  the  percentage of  dry matter  of  leaves  (DML), stems (DMS), leaf / stem ratio (L/S), relative living matter / dead matter (LM / DM). The dried material was also chemically analyzed for protein content and fiber fractions. The experimental design was a randomized block. The data were submitted to analysis of variance and compared Tukey test using the program Assistat. Version 7.6 beta (Silva 2011).Results and ConclusionsIn the shaded pastures, the animals showed an average weight gain of 10 kg during this period, while in the pasture in full sun, weight gain was 3 kg on average per animal. The best performance in 81Growth and enteric methane emission evaluation of cattle in livestockforestintegration system in the Amazon biome in the dry periodthe integrated system (livestock / forest) could be explained by the higher quantity and quality of forage. Forage availability in the inte-grated system was 2.041 kg MS and in the traditional system was 1.811 kg MS. The shaded area was also observed higher values of MSLF and MV / MM were 761.4 and 372.7 and 3.12 against 0.85 in grassland in full sun, respectively.The \u201cMomba\u00e7a\u201d grass on integrated system showed higher values of crude protein, 7.33 against 5.66% MS in the traditional system and lower fiber values (ADF and NDF), 35.46 and 64.00% against MS 37.43 and 66.44% DM respectively in pure pasture. The methane production was similar in both systems and were 121,04 g / CH4 / day and 44.18 kg / CH4 / year for the integrated system and 121,53 g / CH4 / day and 44.361 kg / CH4 / year for the system in full sun (Table 01).Although there are no differences in methane emissions, there was gre-ater productivity in the integrated system which reduces the emission of methane per kilogram of meat produced. Thus it can be concluded that the forest livestock integration system provides better animal performance in the dry season and lower methane emissions per kilo-gram of meat produced in the period.

Integrated silvopastoral, crop- livestock and crop-livestock-forestry systems aim at higher levels of productivity as well as environmental, social and economic sustainability (VILELA, et al., 2011). To that end, the most appropriate alternative must maximize the use of available resources, improve soil quality - the base of agricultural production - and reduce the use of inputs, resulting in higher profitability (DORAN & PARKIN, 1994; SINGER & EWING, 2000).The increasing emission of anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHG), resultant of farming, energy production, disposal of residues and land use change is one of the greatest environmental problems. It is estimated that agriculture is responsible for 20% of total anthropogenic GHG emissions but it can also function as a carbon sink (JOHNSON et al., 2005). The reduction in GHG emissions, including 84Nitrous oxide emission by Pastures in Integrated and Non-Integrated Beef Cattle Production Systems during Springnitrous oxide (N2O), besides  its importance in climate change, helps to reduce losses in livestock production, improving its efficiency (Oliveira et al., 2015). This study aimed at evaluating N2O emissions in pastures under different managements, to better understand important beef cattle production systems in Brazil, specially the integrated systems.Material and MethodsThe study was carried out at Embrapa Pecu\u00e1ria Sudeste, SP  (21\u00b057\u201942\u201dS, 47\u00b050\u201928\u201d W, 860 m) from 29/10/2013 to 19/11/2013. The climate is classified as Cwa (K\u00f6ppen), with two well defined seasons: dry season - April to September, with average temperature and precipitation of 19.9\u00baC and 250 mm, respectively; rainy season - October to March, with average temperature and precipitation of 23.0\u00baC e 1,100 mm, respectively. The soil in the area is classified as Dystrophic Red Latosol. N2O emission was evaluated in the Atlantic Forest (Forest) and in pastures belonging to five production systems: 1) Intensive (INT) - dryland rotational grazing system; 2) Integrated Silvopastoral System (SP) - rotational grazing with eucalyptus trees (15 x 2 m spacing); 3) Integrated Crop-livestock System (CL) - rotational grazing system with crop rotation in each paddock in four year cycles (three years with pasture and one year with corn); 4) Integrated Crop-livestock-forestry System (CLF) - the same as CL with eucalyptus trees (15 x 2 m spacing); 5) Extensive (EXT) - continuous grazing system. Soils in EXT and in an adjacent area of Atlantic Forest were used, respectively, as negative and positive controls.Pastures in INT, SP, CL and CLF were established in 2012 with Urochloa (sin. Brachiaria) brizantha (Hochst ex A. Rich.) Stapf cv. Piat\u00e3 and were fertilized with 50 kg of N ha-1 via urea, in each grazing cycle during the rainy season, amounting to 200 kg N ha-1 year-1. Each of these systems had two replicate pasture areas, of 3 ha each, divided in six paddocks in a rotational system with six days of occupation 85Nitrous oxide emission by Pastures in Integrated and Non-Integrated Beef Cattle Production Systems during Springand 30 days rest. The pasture in EXT was established in 2007 with Urochloa (sin. Brachiaria) decumbens (Stapf) R. Webster and was not fertilized. The EXT system had two pasture areas of 2.85 ha each managed under continuous grazing. The stocking rate was adjusted in all pastures using the \u201cput and take\u201d technique (Mott and Lucas, 1952) and visual evaluation of forage availability.The experimental design was in blocks with repetitions. It was used two repetitions for each pasture area (blocks). Net flows of N2O emissions were evaluated using air samples collected from cylindrical PVC \u201cstatic chambers\u201d. The chamber body was 17cm height and 30 cm in diameter and was covered with insulating material. Six chambers were used per treatment (three per block or pasture area). Three chambers were also allocated in an Atlantic Forest area (positive control). A digital thermometer was adapted to each of the chambers for internal temperature measurement. Three collections of air samples were done in each chamber at 30 min intervals, with polypropylene syringes. Samples were taken between 8:00 and 10:00 a.m. Samples were transferred to evacuated vials, provided with rubber septa and aluminum seals, for later chromatography analysis.ResultsThe general variation in N2O emission rate observed indicate there was an influx of N2O. Accumulated rates during 21 days were small and similar (P>0.05) in INT, SP, CL, CLF and EXT pastures (average of -7.26 g ha-1) - Figure 1. The N2O influx was more intense in the Forest (-39.74 g ha-1) compared to the other systems.The lack of N2O emission, resulting in influx, may be explained by the fact that soils in tropical pastures are generally well drained, aerated and N deficient, impairing N2O emission. Wood e Silver (2012) reported N2O influx in forest with dry soil. In pastures, Whitehead (1995) observed N2O consumption by the grass leaves.86Nitrous oxide emission by Pastures in Integrated and Non-Integrated Beef Cattle Production Systems during SpringConclusionsResults of one season may not reflect the N2O emission pattern of a complete production cycle. Evaluations involving all the four annual se-asons are necessary to fully characterize emissions in integrated sys-tems, the natural forest and traditional beef cattle grazing systems.ReferencesDORAN, J.W.; PARKIN, T.B.

The main GHG related to agricul-ture are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) (Oliveira et al., 2011). Agriculture is responsible for 38% of the natio-nal emissions of nitrous oxide in COeq (MCTI, 2014). Anthropogenic emissions of  N2O are almost all related to the deposition of livestock excreta and the use of nitrogen fertilizers in agriculture. According to the IPCC (2006), 2% of the N derived from bovine excreta that reaches the soil is lost as N2O. Animals on pasture are responsible for approximately 41% of the N2O emitted by agriculture (MCTI, 2014). The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of different milk grazing production systems and seasons on N2O emissions.Material and MethodsThe study was carried out at an experimental station of the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (EMBRAPA), in S\u00e3o Paulo state, Sou-89N2O emission by pastures in different tropical milk production systemstheast of Brazil, in 2012. Twelve Holstein and twelve Jersey-Holstein crossbred dairy cows were used in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement, represented by 2 cattle genotypes (Holstein and Jersey-Holstein) and 2 pasture systems (extensive with low stocking rate - EXT - and intensi-vely managed and irrigated with high stocking rate - IIR). Cows were kept on pastures and received a dietary supplement (concentrate) formulated according to the NRC (2001) in the rate of 1 kg of concen-trate per 3 kg of milk produced. The extensive pasture system was composed of two paddocks, 3.0 ha each, containing Brachiaria spp. and Cynodon nlemfuensis Vanderyst, managed as continuous grazing systems, without fertilization. The intensive managed system was irri-gated and cultivated with Panicum maximum Jacq cv. Tanz\u00e2nia and overseeded with Avena byzantina cv. S\u00e3o Carlos and Loliun multi-floram Lan. cv. BRS Ponteio, in autumn. The IIR systemconsisted of two similar 1.6 ha rotational systems, divided in 27 pa-docks with 600 m2 each, intermittently grazed, with a day of occu-pation and 26 days of rest. The soil (Red-yelow latosol) of intensive managed pastures were limed and fertilized with superphosphate and potassium  chloride to achieve  respectively,  20  mg P.dm-3  and  4%  K in  soil  CTC  - cationexchange capacity. Nitrogen was applied monthly at the annual rate of 456 kg ha-1year-1 (20.05.20 + 6%S).90N2O emission by pastures in different tropical milk production systemsThree cows (tracers) of each genotype grazed simultaneously in each replicate of area. All grazing systems were submitted to stocking rate adjustments using the \u201cput and take\u201d technique (Mott and Lucas, 1952) and visual evaluation of forage availability.The experimental design was in blocks with repetitions. It was used two repetitions for each pasture area (blocks). Net flows of N2O emissions were evaluated using air samples collected from cylindrical PVC \u201cstatic chambers\u201d. The chamber body was 17cm height and 30 cm in diameter and was covered with insulating material. Six chambers were used per treatment (three per block or pasture area). Three cham-bers were also allocated in an Atlantic Forest area (positive control). A digital thermometer was adapted to each of the chambers for internal temperature measurement. Three collections of air samples were done in each chamber at 30 min intervals, with polypropylene syringes. Samples were taken between 8:00 and 10:00 a.m. Samples were transferred to evacuated vials, provided with rubber septa and alumi-num seals, for later chromatography analysis.ResultsValues of nitrous oxide emissions were low, even in the irrigated pas-tures in which a high dose of N was applied. Accumulated N2O emis-sions were effect by the different systems, seasons and it was also observed a system and season interaction (P<0,0001) (Table 1 and Figure 1). In all seasons the intensively managed, irrigated with high stocking rate system produced higher N2O emissions compared to the extensive managed with lower stocking rate and the forest, in which emissions were similar. The higher emissions were verified in summer and autumn compared with winter and spring, except in the forest (Figure 1)91N2O emission by pastures in different tropical milk production systemsConclusionsNitrous oxide emissions were very low in the tropical pastures, inde-pendent of the intensification level.ReferencesIPCC. 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.

The Brazilian beef production is based on tropical pastures. The recovery and intensive management of pastures have shown potential for mitigation of greenhouse gases (GHG) due to the high biomass production of tropical grasses (Oliveira, 2015). The main GHG related to agriculture are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide  (N2O) (Oliveira, 2015). The concentration of N2O in the atmosphere is much lower compared to the CO2 concentration but evaluating its emissions is important due to its high greenhouse effect potential, which is 270 to 310 times higher than that of CO2 (Snyder et al., 2008; MCTI, 2014). The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of different tropical beef production systems and seasons on N2O emissions by pastures.Material and MethodsThe study was carried out at an experimental station of the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (EMBRAPA), S\u00e3o Paulo state, 94Nitrous oxide emission by pastures in tropical beef production systemsSoutheast of Brazil,  in 2014. Treatments consisted of four grazing systems, with two replications each (blocks): 1) IHS: irrigated pasture with high stocking rate (5.9 - animal units - AU/ha; Panicum maximum); 2) DHS: dryland pasture with high stocking rate (4.9 AU/ha; Panicum maximum), 3) DMS: dryland pasture with moderate stocking rate (3.4 AU/ha; Brachiaria brizantha); 4) DP: degraded pasture with low stocking rate (1.1 AU/ha; Brachiaria decumbens ). Pastures in IHS, DHS and DMS were managed as rotational grazing systems with three days of occupation and 33 days of rest cycles. Each replicate area in IHS and DHS systems had 1.75 ha, divided in 12 paddocks. Pastures in IHS received five applications of 80 kg of N during the rainy season and five applications of 40 kg of N during the dry season and were overseeded with temperate grasses in autumn. Pastures in DHS received five applications of 80 kg of N during the rainy season. Each area in DMS had 3.3 ha, divided in six paddocks managed in a rotational system with 6 x 30 d cycles, and received five applications of 40 kg of N during the rainy season. Urea was used as the N source. Pastures in DP were managed under continuous grazing and were not fertilized. The stocking rate in all systems  was adjusted using the \u201cput and take\u201d technique (Mott and Lucas, 1952) and visual evaluation of forage availability. Net flows of N2O emissions were evaluated using air samples collected from cylindrical PVC \u201cstatic chambers\u201d. The chamber body was 17cm height and 30 cm in diameter and was covered with insulating material. Six chambers were used per treatment (three per block or pasture area). Three chambers were also allocated in an Atlantic Forest area (positive control). A digital thermometer was adapted to each of the chambers for internal temperature measurement. Three collections of air samples were done in each chamber, at 30 min intervals, with polypropylene syringes. Samples were taken between 8:00 and 10:00 a.m. Samples were transferred to evacuated vials, provided with rubber septa and aluminum seals, for later chromatography analysis.95Nitrous oxide emission by pastures in tropical beef production systemsResultsAccumulated N2O emissions were effect by the different systems and by the seasons. It was also observed a system and season interaction (Table 1 and Figure 1).  The total emission was higher in IHS, inter-mediate in DHS and similar and lower in DMS, DP and in the forest (Figure 1).

The Cerrado occupies about 23% of the national territory, presenting varied physiognomies. The Cerrado sensu stricto (herbaceous layer with different densities of tree and shrubs) is the predominant physiognomic type with total extent of about 41.8 million hectares. The Cerrado biome may play a significant role on global carbon balance due to carbon storage and fixation. However, vast areas of Cerrado have been degraded as a result of extensive and frequent fire mainly related with cattle ranching.Planted forests in Cerrado are predominant comprised of eucalyptus, which are generally established on degraded pasture. Fast growing Eucalyptus boosts absorption of carbon dioxide from the air and therefore Eucalyptus forestry is considered as a greenhouse gas mitigation option. This study presents a preliminary evaluation of greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions from planted forests in the Cerrado of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil.Materials and methodsInitially, a survey was performed to identify the vegetation types 98Study area characterization and preliminary results on GHG emissions in eucalyptus forest, Mato Grosso do Sulassociated with Eucalyptus plantation. Then the study area was characterized according to soil type, topography, rainfall and land use. The GHG emissions from soil were measured in a stand inside of  the Eucalyptus plantation using a static chamber based technique. Samples for determination of the GHG fluxes at soil-atmosphere interface were collected at monthly intervals.Each chamber is mounted on a metal base of 0.24 m2, which was placed approximately  0.07-0.05 m deep into the soil and stayed installed during the entire field operation. A built-in through 0.09 m height, which holds water, was attached to the metal base to prevent gas leaking. An insulating material was used to cover the water trough to prevent temperature gradients between the interior and exterior of the chambers. First air sample was taken immediately after chamber placement on the base and then after 30 minutes. Samples were collected to evaluate the evolution of the concentration of a gas in the closed chamber with time (linearity test). Concentrations of CO2 and N2O in the samples were determined by use of gas chromatography.Results and ConclusionsSampling was carried out at the Ribas do Rio Pardo county (20o38\u201954\u2019\u2019 S and 54o02\u201910\u2019\u2019 W - 453 meters above sea level), State of Mato Grosso do Sul. The original physiognomic type in this region was cerrado, which was converted into pasture in the 1970s. Due to the inappropriate use occurred degradation. The area was then leased to the planting of eucalyptus clonal called \u201curograndis\u201d. This is a Eucalyptus grandis and E. urophylla crossing, planted at 3 x 2.5 m spacing. Its total area is about 1640 hectares, being characterized by undulating topography (8 to 20%) and Quartzsandy Neosoil ortic soil type.The results indicate that CO2 emissions in the area of study present seasonal fluctuation.

Integrated systems come up as alternatives to overcome this scenario which in turn may have impacts on agricultu-ral greenhouse gas emission. In 2015, we reported the first results on enteric methane (CH4) emissions comparing extensive and integrated systems (Gomes et al., 2015). However, it is important to observe how results behave over time, in order to draw robust conclusions. The aim was to evaluate the enteric methane emission of beef cattle grazing  extensive pastures (EXT), integrated crop-livestock (ICL) and crop-livestock-forest systems (ICLF) in two seasons, over a two-year study.Material and MethodsThe experiment was carried out at Embrapa Beef Cattle Research Center, in Campo Grande, MS, Brazil (20o24\u2019 S, 54o42\u2019W, 560 m asl) in 2014 and 2015. Nellore heifers were submitted to different gra-zing systems as follow: EXT \u2013 Brachiaria decumbens, established in 1992/1993, ICL \u2013 3 years Brachiaria brizantha cv.

BRS Piat\u00e3, following no-till soybean crop, in an area with 227 trees/ha, Eucalyptus urophylla x E. grandis planted in 2009. Twelve Nellore heifers were used per year and randomly allotted to one of six pa-ddocks (1 to 1.5 ha), two paddocks per system. The enteric methane was measured throughout two seasons every year (February/Summer and August/Winter). Experimental animals had 442\u00b123 kg live wei-ght (LW) and 30 mo of age in Summer 2014, 501\u00b134 kg LW and 36 mo of age in Winter 2014, 271\u00b114 kg and 18 mo in Summer 2015 and 382\u00b122 kg and 24 mo in Summer 2015. The CH4 was measu-red using the SF6 tracer gas technique, according to Primavesi et al. (2004) over a minimum  5-day period  each  season.  The  effects  of  year,  season,  treatment  (system) andinteractions were analyzed using a mixed model with repeated mea-sures and means were compared using Tukey-Kramer adjusted test (p<0.05).Results and ConclusionsThere was an interaction between year, season and system effects (p<0.01), therefore results were presented within years. The CH4 emission was much greater in 2014 than in 2015 (183 vs 118 g head-1 d-1, p<0.0001). This may be related to differences in age and live weight of the heifers across years, as in 2015 the heifers were younger and lighter than those used in 2014. However, the main explanation for differences in CH4 emission across years may be laid on differences in pasture availability. For instance, considering the summer season, the ICL and ICLF systems presented 4.3 and 3.6 ton forage dry matter per hectare in 2014, respectively (Gamarra et al., 2014), whereas the availability decreased to 2.2 and 1.2 ton in 2015, respectively (unpublished data). Differences in pasture availabi-lity may have affected dry matter intake which in turn may have led to differences in CH4 emission between 2014 and 2015.102Enteric methane emission of Nellore cattle in extensive grazing or integrated systemsEnteric methane emissions were greater in the summer compared to winter, irrespective the year (Table 1). In average, the differences between seasons were about 9%. The reasons for this results may be the same those explain the differences for CH4 emissions across years as it is expected a lower forage availability during the winter in the Brazilian Cerrado conditions. ICL and ICLF systems presented 4.3 and 3.6 ton forage dry matter per hectare in 2014, respectively (Gamarra et al., 2014), whereas the availability decreased to 2.2 and 1.2 ton in 2015, respectively (unpublished data). Differences in pasture availability may have affected dry matter intake which in turn may have led to differences in CH4 emission between 2014 and 2015.  Enteric methane emissions were greater in the summer compared to winter, irrespective the year (Table 1). In average, the differences between seasons were about 9%. The reasons for this results may be the same those explain the differences for CH4 emissions across years as it is expected a lower forage availability during the winter in the Brazilian Cerrado conditions.

In 2014, there were no differences for CH4 emissions during the summer, with an average of 191 g-1 d-1 head. Conversely, during the winter, ILC system had a greater CH4 emission followed by ICLF and EXT. In turn, in 2015, no differences across systems were observed for both summer and winter. As explained before, forage availability may affect dry matter intake and, in turn, CH4 emission. Therefore, this may explain why the differences across systems observed in 2014 were not observed in the following year. In conclusion, differences in CH4 emission among grazing systems, including extensive and integrated systems (ILC and ILCF), may exist; however they seem to be mainly driven by the effects of forage availability within systems which, in  turn, may vary as a function of climate factors and of pasture management (e.g. stocking rate).

It stands out due to the persistence of its molecule in the atmosphere and to its high global warming potential. Approximately 7% of the direct N2O emissions within agricultural land comes from the use of synthetic fertilizers (MCTI, 2013). There is need to spread technologies that reduce the production of this g\u00e1s. To this end it is necessary to investigate the different marketed nitrogen (N) sources, such as the protected ureias and in combination with other components (such as zeolites) that may contribute to reduce the emission of N2O, being more efficiently used by the plants.Material and MethodsThe study was conducted at fazenda Capivara, experimental area belonging to Embrapa Rice and Beans, located in the municipality of Santo Ant\u00f4nio de Goi\u00e1s-GO. The  soil  is Red Latosol (53% clay). The experimental design was completely randomized blocks ((5 + 1) x 4) corresponding to five N sources and the control (without application of N) and four replicates (total 24 plotes, 32 m2 each). The test plant was upland rice in integrated crop-livestock system under zero tilla-ge. Gas samples were collected using manual static  chambers. Sam-105Nitrous oxide fluxes from different nitrogen sources applied in upland rice in the cerrado goianopling was made 0, 15, 30 minutes after the closing of the cham-bers. N2O fluxes were measured by gas chromatography. Were held two fertilization, one soon after planting and another as topdressing, each 60 kg N ha-1, were applied. The N sources used were: common urea (45%), urea + polymer (43%), urea + NBPT (N-45%), urea + inhibitor (44.6%), urea + zeolite (36% N). The emission factor was determined by the amount N lost in the form  of N2O (difference be-tween the total emissions in the treatments with nitrogen fertilization and control) in relation to the total amount of N applied. The emission was expressed per unit of product and evaluated through the rela-tionship between the total N2O emissions and the amount of grain produced for each source used of N. The evaluations were conducted in the period of November 2, 2014 to November 10, 2015.Results and ConclusionsAlthough nitrogenous fertilizers are costly and have potential to cause damage to the environment, these are commonly used in indiscrimina-ted manner by large scale producers causing losses to the atmosphere and groundwater. Among the nitrogenous fertilizers used in Brazil urea is the most required for fertilization of crops because it has lower cost per kg of N. However, the use of urea is not always effective because heavy losses occur after its application. The source of urea + inhibitor presented the highest N2O emission when compared to control and treatment of urea + polymer. The N sources treatments did not present significant differences for the other evaluated factors (Table 1). The association of the urea  +  polymer  as  a  mechanism  of  re-duction  of  ur\u00e9ase  in  nitrogen  fertilization favored reduction of N2O fluxes and lower emissions in the rice cultivation of uplands. However, the use urea + inhibitor, under the conditions of the study, was not effective in reducing the losses of N in the form of N2O.106Nitrous oxide fluxes from different nitrogen sources applied in upland rice in the cerrado goianoReferencesMCTI.

In Brazil, the productive sector indicated as GHG emitter is related to soil use, agriculture, and livestock. In 2014, the  Brazilian agricultu-re and livestock emission represented about 20% of the overall GHG emission (SEEG, 2016). Particularly in livestock farming, one of the main GHG emission factors pertains to methane (CH4) coming from ru-minants enteric fermentation, which account for 68% of the emissions in the livestock sector (BERCHIELLI et al., 2012).CH4 emission by ruminants represents loss of part of the energy in-gested by the animals. Some factors impact this emission, such as the quality and amount of food intake, digestive system, and animal 108Enteric Methane Estimation with TIER 2 Compared to Results Obtained in a Field Experiment with Water Buffaloes Supplemented with Palm Kernel Cake in the Amazon Biome age. Different strategies have been planned to reduce GHG emissions by livestock, involving activity, nutritional, and reproductive manage-ment (BERNDT, 2012). Nutritional strategies are evaluated to decrease emissions such as supplementing ruminant diets with lipids. It was observed that, for every 1% of fat added to the diet, CH4 production per kg of dry matter consumed decreases by up to 6%  (ABDALLA et al., 2008).Methodologies are tested to assess GHG emissions, such as employing mathematical equations to estimate enteric methane emissions. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has developed equations that allow ranking methane production into TIER 1, TIER 2, and TIER 3 depending on information such as animal characteristics and feed.This study aimed to estimate enteric methane emissions using TIER 2 considering the same diet used in a field trial using sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) as tracing gas in  female buffaloes that consumed different levels of palm kernel cake in the Amazon biome.Material and MethodsTIER 2 equations were used considering the same diet used in the field  trial to quantify enteric methane emission by the SF6 tracing gas technique according to methodology described by Johnson et al. (1994). These field trial data were obtained by the PECUS Project and belong to the database of the doctorate thesis of one member of the research team. It is worth pointing out that the field data were obtained at the \u201cSenador \u00c1lvaro Adolpho\u201d Animal Research Unity, belonging to Embrapa Eastern Amazon, in the city of Bel\u00e9m, Par\u00e1, Brazil. The diets were provided to 24 crossbred Murrah and Mediterranean female buffaloes, whose mean weight of 514 \u00b1 69.88 kg, belonging to the Embrapa Eastern Amazon\u2019s experimental herd. The study was approved by the Committee of Animal Ethics \u2013 CEUA under protocol 007/2015. The animals were managed in confinement 109Enteric Methane Estimation with TIER 2 Compared to Results Obtained in a Field Experiment with Water Buffaloes Supplemented with Palm Kernel Cake in the Amazon Biome (tie stall) and spent 21 days adapting to the experimental diets with free access to water and mineral mix. The experiment followed a completely randomized design with four treatments and six repetitions: In this study, only three treatments were considered, i.e., palm kernel cake inclusion in relation to body weight (BW) at the levels of 0% (T1), control; 0.5% (T2); and 1.0% (T3). All treatments were added with 0.15% (BW) wheat bran as palatability agent and corn silage was used as roughage. The animals were individually fed twice a day (8 AM and 5 PM). The amounts of silage were weighed daily and adjusted to achieve daily leftovers of up to 10%.Those diets were used to estimate the emission factor adopting the methodology developed by the IPCC (IPCC, 2006), called TIER 2. Cha-racteristics of the animals and diets were considered such as: animal age, initial weight, mean weight, weight gain, digestible energy, and gross energy.Results and ConclusionsThe results of enteric methane emissions presented in Table 1 show that the means in the control treatment with addition of 0.5% palm kernel cake did not differ according to Tukey\u2019s test at 5% probability. TIER 2 can be used as an estimator of enteric methane emissions when the diet\u2019s nutritional composition is known. The measurements with SF6 in the treatment with 1% BW were below the estimates with TIER 2, which confirms that the tracing gas methodology is ac-curate to assess enteric methane emissions in animals fed the diet with the highest level of palm kernel cake inclusion. These results corrobo-rate that adding fat to the diet reduces CH4 production per kg of dry matter consumed by ruminants (ABDALLA et al., 2008). The highest emission was identified in animals in the control treatment, i.e., which received no palm kernel cake. The results show that TIER 2 was able to estimate enteric methane emissions for diets with up to 0.5% BW inclusion for female buffaloes since the results did not differ statisti-cally between the two methods analyzed.110Enteric Methane Estimation with TIER 2 Compared to Results Obtained in a Field Experiment with Water Buffaloes Supplemented with Palm Kernel Cake in the Amazon Biome Enteric methane emission estimated by TIER 2 had values close to tho-se measured with the SF6 tracing gas technique up to 0.5% BW lipid supplementation, but values were overestimated for lipid supplementa-tion at 1.0% BW. Therefore, TIER 2 can be used to calculate ruminant emissions in the Amazon biome since most of the herd in the region is reared in extensive ranching. Another noteworthy aspect is that the tra-cing gas methodology requires trained labor, laboratory structure, and a structured research team, such as PECUS Network.ReferencesABDALLA, A.

Brazilian production of milk tripled between 1970 and 2006 (IBGE, 2016), and the country is currently the sixth largest producer in the world and growing at an annual rate of 4%, which is higher than that of the other top produ-cing countries. The availability of forage, both in quantity and quality, is essential for the animals\u2019 production to reach maximum potential, and directly influences animal productivity, area productivity, overall productivity, breeding potential and herd health (Carvalho et. al, 2016). Focusing on this line of reasoning and on gathering economical and environmental sustainability, researchers have been evaluating the in-troduction of new forage types and management techniques that dri-ve the industry to higher productivity without the need for expanding the areas used. Our objective in this study was to evaluate the effect of two dairy-cattle production systems on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) of the pasture, obtained from a temporal series of Landsat images. The greenness displayed in the NDVI values may be correlated with plant production to indicate a stronger or we-aker production, as well as to act as an indicator for different types of management of livestock systems (Alvarenga et al., 2015). On its turn, the pastures\u2019 biomass production may be correlated with poten-tial for carbon storage in the soil (Oliveira, 2015).113Evaluation of Vegetation Indices at Pasture-Based Systems for Dairy Cattle using Remote Sensing DataMaterial and MethodsThe study area is located within the Mata Atl\u00e2ntica biome (Brazilian Atlantic Forest), with average annual precipitation of 1,362 mm, average annual temperature of 21.5 \u00baC and humid subtropical climate. The experimental design featured the following dairy-cattle production systems: (A) irrigated with intensive management and high stocking rate (INTIRRI_AL)   and degraded pasture with continuous grazing and low stocking rate (EXTDEGR_BL) (Figure 1). The two systems are described in Table 1.The NDVI values were extracted from OLI/Landsat-8 images using the method described by Concei\u00e7\u00e3o et al. (2015). The temporal data consisted of 30 cloud-free images taken from April 2013 to August 2015. The NDVI values of each production system were grouped  based on season under \u2018dry season 2013\u2019, \u2018rainy season 2013/2014\u2019, \u2018dry season 2014\u2019, \u2018rainy season 2014/2015\u2019, and \u2018dry season 2015\u2019. The Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA statistical analysis was applied in order to discriminate each production system for each described period.

Brazilian production of milk tripled between 1970 and 2006 (IBGE, 2016), and the country is currently the sixth largest producer in the world and growing at an annual rate of 4%, which is higher than that of the other top producing countries. The availability of forage, both in quantity and quality, is essential for the animals' production to reach maximum potential, and directly influences animal productivity, area productivity, overall productivity, breeding potential and herd health (Carvalho et. al, 2016). Focusing on this line of reasoning and on gathering economical and environmental sustainability, researchers have been evaluating the introduction of new forage types and management techniques that drive the industry to higher productivity without the need for expanding the areas used. Our objective in this study was to evaluate the effect of two dairy-cattle production systems on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) of the pasture, obtained from a temporal series of Landsat images. The greenness displayed in the NDVI values may be correlated with plant production to indicate a stronger or weaker production, as well as to act as an indicator for different typ s of management of livestock systems (Alvarenga et al., 2015). On its turn, the pastures' biomass production may be correlated with potential for carbon storage in the soil (Oliveira, 2015).  Material and M thods The study area is located within the Mata Atl\u00e2ntica biome (Brazilian Atlantic Forest), with average annual precipitation of 1,362 mm, average annual temperature of 21.5 \u00baC and humid subtropical climate. The experimental design featured the following dairy-cattle production systems: (A) irrigated with i tensive management and high stocking rate (INTIRRI_AL) and (B) degraded pasture with continuous grazing and low stocking rate (EXTDEGR_BL) (Figure 1). The two systems are described in Table 1.  Table 1. Description of the pasture-based dairy-cattle production systems. Production system Stocking rate Pasture management Grass N dose (kg ha-1) INTIRRI_AL high Rotation Panicum maximum >100 EXTDEGR_BL low extensive/continuous Brachiaria decumbens 0  The NDVI values were extracted from OLI/Landsat-8 images using the method described by Concei\u00e7\u00e3o et l. (2015). The temporal ata consisted of 30 cloud-free images taken from April 2013 to August 2015. The NDVI values of each production system were grouped based  on season under 'dry season 2013', 'r iny season 2013/2014', 'dry season 2014', 'rainy season 2014/2015', and 'dry season 2015'. The Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA statistical analysis was applied in order to discriminate each production system for each described period.  Figure 1. Experimental design with the beef cattle production systems at the study area.  Results and Conclusions Figure 2 shows average NDVI values in each experimental area for each OLI/Landsat-8 image. As expected, the intensive management, high stocking rate system showed the highest NDVI values, with a global average of 0.74 (Table 2). The extensive degraded pasture with low stocking rate system showed average NDVI values 8% lower (0.68), reaching up to 12% in the dry season of 2014.    Figure 2.

The best performance of the intensive system is due to the grass species chosen, which is more productive under favorable conditions of minimum air temperature and availability of water in the soil (Table 1) despite the higher animal load and the consequent higher biomass consumption (Muller et al., 2002). Vegetation indices show good potential for use in the monitoring of pasture greenness. Well-managed pastures favor carbon accumulation in the soil and contribute to mitigate the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.  References  ALVARENGA, S. V. R.; NOGUEIRA, S.

However, since 2009, integrated production systems have been gaining popularity, grain production has increased, and deforestation has decreased, which makes the city a reference in agriculture and livestock production and awarded it the green city seal in the Amazon. Studying the effects caused by changes in soil use in the Amazon is very important since, in recent years, this region has been an intense agricultural frontier. The implementation of pastures and annual crops led to a significant increase in the removal of natural soil cover as well as high CO2 emissions in the Amazon region (BRASIL, 2002).Soil carbon (C) content distribution can be modeled based on me-asurements over time that assess the chemical kinetics of released carbon. The description of the mineralization process takes into ac-count the simple exponential model with two parameters, namely \u03b21 the initial carbon content and \u03b20  the mineralization rate (Martines et al., 2006).In soil carbon mineralization trials, the characteristics inherent to the process may cause issues in data analysis such as non-normal error, 117Nonlinear Modeling with Sandwich Estimator Approach to Analyze Soil Carbon Profilevariance heterogeneity, and autocorrelation between soil contents along the soil profile. According to Ritz and Streiberg (2008), these issues may be dealt with in two ways. One is based on the use of nonlinear mixed-effects models, which are quite flexible by allowing the variance and covariance matrix structure to be changed. The other approach is based on robust standard error estimates, i.e., sandwich estimators (Zeileis, 2006).This study aimed to i) apply the basis of the nonlinear models theory with least squares method using sandwich estimators to a dataset formed by the C content along the soil profile in the Crop-Livestock-Forest Integration system (ILPF); ii) use bootstrap resampling to enhance the precision of the estimates and carbon dynamics along the soil profile.Material and MethodsThe research was carried out at Vit\u00f3ria Farm, located in the city of Paragominas, southeast Par\u00e1, Brazil, at the geographic coordinates 2\u00b059\u201958.37\u201d SE 47\u00b021\u201921.29\u201d W. This study  approaches the agrosil-vopastoral system established in 2009 with Khaya ivorensis A. Chev. and rotation with Brachiaria ruziziensis R. Germ Evrard with Zea mays L. (corn). Annual crop rotation remained until 2012, after which the area was managed only with pasture and the forest species. Soil was collected in 2013 by opening five trenches (I, II, III, IV, and V) in the study site, in which samples were collected from three walls in the layers 0-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40, 40-60, 60-80, and 80-100 cm deep.The exponential nonlinear model was used to describe the mean behavior of  the carbon content responses in the ILPF system. Overall, the C content in the ith sample (subject) at the jth depth of  the  uth  system can  be  represented  by   where xij  is  the  depth  of the  ith sample (i = 1,..., N) at the jth depth (j = 1, ..., ni). The poor specification of distribution assumptions (spatial correlation and variance heterogeneity) led to the estimation of the 118Nonlinear Modeling with Sandwich Estimator Approach to Analyze Soil Carbon Profilerobust variance and covariance matrices called sandwich estimator, implemented in the sandwich package (Zeileis, 2006).Results and ConclusionsThe estimates of the model with and without the sandwich estimator are presented, respectively, in Tables 1 and 2. The corresponding standard errors and p-value significance differ between the approa-ches presented. For instance, the parameter \u03b21 (initial carbon content) for the third trench was not statistically significant with the use of the sandwich estimator, whereas this parameter was significant when that estimator was not used. Modeling with no validity of the assumptions lead to inadequate standard errors, Student\u2019s t-distribution, p-value, and confidence intervals and, consequently, cause mistaken inferences and decision-making (Table 1).  Results and Conclusions  The estimates f the model with and wit out the sandwich estimator are presented, respectively, in Tables 1 and 2. The corresponding standard errors and p-value significance differ between the approaches presented. For instance, the parameter \u03b21 (initial carbon content) for the third trench was not statistically significant with the use of the sandwich estimator, whereas this parameter was significant when that estimator was not used.

In this context, the use of geostatistics to analyze the spatial variability of the pastures\u2019 vegetation indices is valuable for understanding how management methods influence livestock production. Geostatistics is a tool that considers spatial dependency to interpolate data with no tendency and with minimum variance, which enables the production of precise maps using interpolated values at places that were not sampled (Vieira, 2000). The spatialization of vegetation indices such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) helps to eva-luate the quality of pastures and to identify areas which may undergo a degradation process. In this study we intended to spatially  evaluate two pasture management methods, rotational grazing and continuous grazing, using geostatistics and the NDVI as an indicator obtained from Landsat images of an area located in Pirassununga, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, taken in 2011.Material and MethodsThe study area is located within the campus of Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo at Pirassununga, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, and features two pasture 122Geostatistical Analysis of NDVI in rotational and continuous grazing pasturestypes with Brachiaria brizantha: continuous grazing (no rest and no pasture rotation) and rotational grazing (7 days of grazing and 28 days of rest). The area is located within the Mata Atl\u00e2ntica biome (Brazilian Atlantic Forest), and features average annual precipitation of 1,300 mm, average annual temperature of 23 \u00baC and humid subtropical clima-te (Cwa according to the K\u00f6ppen classification). The NDVI was extrac-ted from Landsat-5 satellite images using the method described by Concei\u00e7\u00e3o et al. (2015) on a 604-point grid using UTM coordinates and after calculating the Rouse et al. (1973) equation. The data were subjected to descriptive statistical analysis, normality test, and geos-tatistics. Semivariance was calculated according to Vieira (2000), in order to analyze the existence of spatial variability of the NDVI values in nine dates of 2011: April 28, May 14, May 30, June 15, July 17, August 2, August 18, September 3, and September 19. The semivario-grams, which are graphic representations of NDVI\u2019s semivariance (with distances in meters) were adjusted according to the best corres-pondence model. After the adjustments were made, the data were interpolated using ordinary kriging and the semivariogram\u2019s adjustment parameters, and the results were displayed as isoline maps created using the ArcGIS 10.3 software.Results and ConclusionsThe results of the descriptive statistical analysis (Table 1) show avera-ge NDVI values ranging from 0.065 to 0.763 and with strong variation at each sampled date. As a result, the frequency distribution normality was not significant (5%) according to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. This variation is related to the seasonal variation in the average rain-fall rate of Pirassununga according to the S\u00e3o Paulo State (Secretaria de Estado de Saneamento e Recursos H\u00eddricos) (S\u00c3O PAULO, 2016). The sampling refers to the dry season (sampled), from April to Septem-ber, and June, July and August show low NDVI averages.123Geostatistical Analysis of NDVI in rotational and continuous grazing pasturesGeostatistical analysis enabled the creation of semivariograms, which were adjusted individually, mostly using the exponential model, and tendencies for May 30 and June 15 were removed. All nine dates showed spatial dependency varying from 61 to 650 m. The semivariogram is shown for visualization purposes in Figure 1, scaled according to Vieira et al. (1997) and considering that the vegetation index values are at the same scale. according to the S\u00e3o Paulo State (Secretaria de Estado de Saneamento e Recursos H\u00eddricos) (S\u00c3O PAULO, 2016).

Maps of NDVI values interpolated using ordinary kriging in nine dates along 2011. The rotational grazing system leads to a better recovery of the pasture's vegetation index, even under water stress conditions, especially in July, August and September, except for August 18, when the whole area showed NDVI values lower than 0.2. We therefore conclude that resting the pastures enables restoring their leaf area index, thus leading to a greater soil coverage and hence reaching greater management efficiency.

In this context, the main thermoregulatory mechanism in homeothermic animals is an increase in surface temperature, although other physiological parameters such as heart and respiratory rates are also indicative of environmental heat stress (Hahn, 1985; Bouzida et al., 2009).Infrared thermography, a technique that detects thermal radiation emit-ted by an object, is a non-invasive alternative to evaluate body tempe-rature of free ranging animals.Goal of this work was to correlate temperatures obtained by ther-mal imaging with physiological responses from grazing cattle in Central Brazil.Material and MethodsThe trial was carried out at Fazenda S\u00e3o Carlos, Tr\u00eas Lagoas Munici-pality, Mato Grosso do Sul State, Brazil (20 \u00b0 45\u201904 \u2018\u2019 S and 51 \u00b0 127Correlation between physiological parameters and thermal infrared emissions from free ranging cattle40\u201942 \u2018\u2019 W), in March and August 2015. Local weather pattern is Aw (tropical hot and humid), according to K\u00f6ppen classification, with local average temperature and rainfall of 26\u00b0C and 1400 mm respectively.54 young heifers from four different genetic groups were used, i.e, 14 Nellore (NEL), 12 \u00bd Angus x \u00bd Nellore (ANGNEL), 14 Senepol (SEN) and 14 \u00bc x \u00bc Brahman Nellore x 2/4 Senepol (TRI) with average initial live weight of 197, 235, 169 and 233 kg, and final weight of 252, 282, 221 and 276 kg, respectively. Average age was between five and seven months. Animals were kept in Brachiaria brizantha cv. Xara-\u00e9s pasture, with ad libitum water supply and dry feed supplementation with commercial balanced feed on creep feeding.Physiological parameters evaluated were: rectal temperature (TR \u00b0C) using digital clinical thermometer (Digi-temp, Kruuse\u00ae), introduced into the animal\u2019s rectum with the reading bulb in contact with the mucosa and kept in this position until the read signal was heard. Tem-perature of skin surface (TSP, \u00b0C) and temperature of hair surface (TSPM, \u00b0C), read from the animal\u2019s back were obtained using a portable infrared pyrometer (model 890, Instrutherm\u00ae). Heart beat rate (FC, beats/minute), was obtained by auscultation of the cardiac movements, for 15 seconds, using a stethoscope placed in the 4th intercostal space of animal\u2019s right hand side.Respiratory rate (FR, breaths/minute), was obtained through direct observation of animal1s flank movements for 15 seconds. FC and FR values were multiplied by four to estimate values for a one-minute evaluation.Thermal emissions were measured through thermographic images from animal\u2019s head and the left eye (Figure 1) using infrared imager Testo\u00ae (model 875 2i), set to emissivity of 0.95 (animals and biological material) palette for data recording set for hot and cold and 25mm lens (9\u00b0x7\u00b0). Later, in order to obtain the maximum and minimum values for head (TIC,\u00b0C) and eye temperature (TIO, \u00b0C), all images were ana-lyzed through IRSoft\u00ae (Testo software), with palette for records set 128Correlation between physiological parameters and thermal infrared emissions from free ranging cattlefor hot and cold and definition for measuring points set for the options free form and circle. Correlations among the variables were obtained through SAS CORR procedure, version 9.4.Results and ConclusionsThe thermoneutral zone in an animal is defined by N\u00c3\u00c3S (1989) as a range limited by the maximum and minimum temperature considered optimal for its husbandry, in which, maintenance of homeothermy occurs with minimal deployment of mechanisms responsible for thermal regulation.High correlations (P <0.05) were found between infrared eye tempe-rature (TIO) and infrared head temperature (TIC) (0.77), and between temperature of hair surface (TSPM) and temperature of skin surface (TSP) (0.83). Moderate correlation was found between heart beat rate (FC) and respiratory rate (FR) (0.68), and weak correlations were observed between TIO and rectal temperature (TR) (0.41) as well as between TIC and TR (0.45) (Table 1).In the literature, TR is considered the best indicator for predicting ther-moregulation in cattle. Because in this work infrared thermography has shown low/moderate correlation with all other parameters evaluated, it does not hinder its use for inference about thermal regulation processes in cattle, since it is a technology that still needs better-defined proto-cols for use in free ranging animals.  Respiratory rate (FR, breaths/minute), was obtained through direct observation of animal1s flank movements for 15 seconds. FC and FR values were multiplied by four to estimate values for a one-minute evaluation.  Thermal emissions were measured through thermographic images from animal's head and the left eye (Figure 1) using infrared imager Testo\u00ae (model 875 2i), set to emissivity of 0.95 (animals and biological material) palette for data recording set for hot and cold and 25mm lens (9\u00b0x7\u00b0). Later, in order to obtain the maximum and minimum values for head (TIC,\u00b0C) and eye temperature (TIO, \u00b0C), all images were analyzed through IRSoft\u00ae (Testo software), with palette for records set for hot and cold and definition for measuring points set for the options free form and circle. Correlations among the variables were obtained through SAS CORR procedure, version 9.4.    Figure 1: Infrared thermal images of the evaluated spots (head and eye).

According to soil inorganic-N pools and the site studied, forest or pasture, and pastures age the soil inorganic-N pools of ammonium and nitrate can be similar in the forest or ammonium dominated in the pasture. Also annual average net nitrification rates at soil surface in forest can be higher than in pasture suggesting a higher potential for nitrate-N losses either through leaching or gaseous emissions from intact forests compared with established pastures (NEILL et al., 1995). To Melillo et al. (2001) nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from the newly created pasture (5.0 kg N2O-N ha-1 yr-1) were about two and one half times the forest emissions (9.0 kg N2O-N ha-1 yr-1) during the first 2 years and N2O fluxes from pastures older than 3 years (1.4 kg N2O-N ha-1 yr-1) were on average about one third lower than fluxes from uncut forest (9.0 kg N2O-N ha-1  yr-1). One of the best predictor of N2O flux from soil is the magnitude of the nitrate   pool in the soil surface (VERCHOT et al., 1999, MELILLO et al., 2001). The N2O emissions can be measured from samples from the field by gas chromatograph or estimated  by process-based mo-dels. Denitrification-Decomposition (DNDC) model simulates carbon and nitrogen biogeochemical cycles occurring in agricultural systems (GILTRAP et al., 2010). Here we presented N2O emissions simulated by DNDC model from grass (> 30 years old) and grass-legume pastu-131Modeling Nitrous Oxide emissions in grass and grass-legume pastures in the western Brazilian Amazonres (> 4 years old after grass > 30 years old) and from soil of a native forest in the western Brazilian Amazon.Material and MethodsThe study was conducted to predict the soil N2O emissions by DNDC in a Ultisol under a pure Brachiaria humidicola (Rendle) Scheick pasture (G) and a mixed pasture of B. humidicola and Arachis pintoi Krapov. & W. C. Greg cv. BRS Mandobi (GL), both without fertiliza-tion. A native forest (NF) classified as Bamboo open+dense, on the same soil type, was the reference. The experiment was stablished in 2011 at the Guaxup\u00e9 farm (68\u00b0 05\u2019 W, 9\u00b0 57\u2019 S, 200 m a.s.l) in Rio Branco, state of Acre, Brazil. Deforestation of the experimental area occurred in 1981. Soil sampling was carried in G, in the GL, and in the NF, on the same soil type in 2014 Feb-Dec. and 2015 Jan-July in the 0-0.10 and 0.10-0.20 m layers. Soil analyses were according to Pecus network protocols and results and meteorological data were inputs to DNDC to predict N2O emissions (LI et al., 1994) in the same period 2014 Feb-Dec. and 2015 Jan-July.Results and ConclusionsAverage N2O emission in 166 days followed the order: pure pasture (35.8 \u00b5g N m-2 h-1) > native forest (28.2 \u00b5g N m-2 h-1) > mixed pas-ture (27.2 \u00b5g N m-2 h-1). N2O emissions were lowest in the season\u2019s transitions wet-dry and dry-wet and highest in the wet and dry charac-teristics seasons of the Brazilian Amazon.N2O emissions were correlated with water-filled pore space (WFPS 0-0.10 m) and soil temperature (0-0.1. m) in NF, G and GL (P < 0.05) and were no correlated with soil nitrate-N contents.Annual N2O emission was 3.13 kg N ha-1 yr-1 in G, 2.47 kg N ha-1 yr-1 in NF and 2.38 kg N ha-1 yr-1 in GL. The annual N2O flux simu-lated is in the range fluxes tabulated by Verchot et al. (1999) to N2O 132Modeling Nitrous Oxide emissions in grass and grass-legume pastures in the western Brazilian Amazonfluxes in the humid tropical forests (0.3 to 6.7 kg N ha-1 yr-1) and according to Meurer et al. (2016) to pastures.Total predicted N2O flux in the assessed period was 4.6 kg N ha-1 in G, 3.0 kg N ha-1 in NF and 2.7 kg N ha-1 in GL (Figure 1) and are higher than the reported by Melillo et al. (2001) for old pastures but are in the range reported by Meuer et al. (2016). Results and Conclusions Average N2O emission in 166 days followed the order: pure pasture (35.8 \u03bcg N m-2 h-1) > native forest (28.2 \u03bcg N m-2 h-1) > mixed pasture (27.2 \u03bcg N m-2 h-1).  N2O emissions were lowest in the season\u2019s transitions wet-dry and dry-wet and highest in the wet and dry characteristics seasons of the Brazilian Amazon. N2O emissions were correlated with water-filled pore space (WFPS 0-0.10 m) and soil temperature (0-0.1. m) in NF, G and GL (P < 0.05) and were no correlated with soil nitrate-N contents. Annual N2O emission was 3.13 kg N ha-1 yr-1 in G, 2.47 kg N ha-1 yr-1 in NF and 2.38 kg N ha-1 yr-1 in GL. The annual N2O flux simulated is in the range fluxes tabulated by Verchot et al. (1999) to N2O fluxes in the humid tropical forests (0.3 to 6.7 kg N ha-1 yr-1) and according to Meurer et al. (2016) to pastures. Total predicted N2O flux in the assessed period was 4.6 kg N ha-1 in G, 3.0 kg N ha-1 in NF and 2.7 kg N ha-1 in GL (Figure 1) and are higher than the reported by Melillo et al. (2001) for old pastures but are in the range reported by Meuer et al. (2016).   Figure 1. Total predicted N2O flux at the Guaxup\u00e9 farm, Acre State, Brazil. NF = native forest. G = single pasture of Brachiaria humidicola and GL = mixed pasture of B. humidicola with Arachis pintoi cv BRS Mandobi. Values are mean of 38 simulations of the soil parameters that were the inputs to DNDC. Bars are standard deviation.  Although in the range of N2O fluxes measured across the Brazilian Amazon, the N2O fluxes estimated by DNDC in this study should be treated with caution, as the fields\u2019 results to N2O emissions are not yet available to comparison with simulated fluxes.

However, establishing the dynamics of greenhouse gases (GHG) is very complex, especially for integrated production systems  such as silvopastoral, which are seen as alternatives to reduce GHG emissions (BERNDT,  2010). In this context, the PECUS Research Network - Greenhouse Gases Dynamics in Brazilian Livestock Production Systems - was created by Embrapa (Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation) in order to evaluate GHG dynamics in agricultural systems in six Brazilian biomes (Atlantic Forest, Caatinga, Pantanal, Pampa, Amazon and Cerrado), envolving more than 300 Brazilian and international researchers. The GeoPECUS - Geotechnologies Applied to Dynamics of Greenhouse Gases in Brazilian Agriculture - project has the responsibility to support PECUS with geotechnologies based on remote sensing, generating information which may subsidize the government in the creation of environmental and economically sustainable policies for agriculture.Geospatial data generation and storage capacity are growing as consequence of increased computational resources available to users from various sectors, including remote sensing (BAYMA-SILVA et al., 135WEB PLATFORM FOR GEOSPATIAL INFORMATION:APLICATIONS FOR GEOPECUS PROJECT2015). Researches in the environmental area apply geoprocessing and WebGIS (GIS system that uses web technologies) as powerful tools for spatial analysis and environmental management. According to Barriguinha (2008), the internet can be considered a privileged environment to make available large amounts of geographic information, expanding its access. A process for geospatial data organization is needed in order to make this type of information accessible and understandable to potential users.The National Commission of Cartography (CONCAR), through the work of its specialized committees, have set standards and rules to be adopted in the production and publishing of geospatial data and information by public institutions. Considering this, the Brazilian National Spatial Data Infrastructure (INDE) was instituted with the purpose of cataloging, integrating and harmonizing existing geospatial data in Brazilian government institutions. Thus, this data can be easily located, explored and accessed for various uses, by any client with access to the Internet. Geospatial data should be cataloged using their respective metadata, published by the producers/maintainers of such data. The coordination of this infrastructure is responsibility of CONCAR.The aim of this article is to describe and report how the GeoPECUS project is using the standards and rules established by the Brazilian National SDI to publish and organize the geospatial data produced by the PECUS Research Network.Material and MethodsFor the present project, it was used Embrapa Spatial Data Infrastructure, GeoInfo (Drucker et al. 2015) - Figure 1. One of its tools is Geonode (http://www.geonode.org), which is a web- based application and platform for developing Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) and for deploying spatial data infrastructures (SDI). It is designed to be extended, modified and can be integrated into existing platforms. Considering this, Geonode was adapted in order to 136WEB PLATFORM FOR GEOSPATIAL INFORMATION:APLICATIONS FOR GEOPECUS PROJECTpresent all the fields recommended by CONCAR, especially in metadata information. CONCAR metadata specifications are based on widely adopted OGC standards, specially ISO-19115.A pattern in the attribute tables of the geospatial data was planned to allow that all experimental areas of the GeoPECUS project, which are the same of PECUS Research Network, have the same variables, so that it would be possible to make comparisons and other analysis. The geospatial data comprises detailed information about  the  produc-tion systems and vector archives of the experimental areas. It also comprises the orbital images of the experimental areas, from different satellites (Geoeye, Ikonos and WorldView),  ortoretified and added into GeoInfo as layers.Maps were elaborated in A0 format and uploaded as image files and attribute tables of the experimental areas were transferred to platform as documents. All metadata information was cataloged and is available in the platform as shown in Figure 2. Furthermore, it shows all tabs available in GeoInfo related to geospatial information.Figure 1. Main interface of GeoInfo: Embrapa Spatial Data Infrastructure137WEB PLATFORM FOR GEOSPATIAL INFORMATION:APLICATIONS FOR GEOPECUS PROJECTAll data previously reported was uploaded in this platform in its res-pective tabs, for example, \u201cLayers\u201d for the boundaries shapefiles and ortoretified images, \u201cDocuments\u201d for the shapefiles\u2019 table of attributes and A0 maps. In the tab \u201cMaps\u201d, maps were elaborated for therespective experimental areas, highlighting the production systems and  ortoretified images that were added as base to these layers. It is im-portant to highlight that the permission to download, visualize, edit a layer or metadata information is given by the platform user, accor-ding to the rules established by GeoInfo.Results and ConclusionsUntil now, it was uploaded information of twenty-three experimental areas of GeoPECUS project: files in vector format, table of attributes related to the experimental areas organized in spreadsheet format and also twenty-three maps related to these areas. Among these areas, six correspond to the Amazon Rainforest biome, six to the Cerrado bio-me, five to the Atlantic Forest biome, three to the Pampa biome, two to the Caatinga biome and one to the Pantanal biome. Thirty-five A0 Figure 2.

The GeoInfo platform contains not only  GeoPECUS  data  but  also  geos-patial  data  from  other  projects  (e.g.  Climatic Risk Zoning), which indicates that this web platform is an efficient tool to organize geoin-formation and disseminate this type of data to researches, who may seek references. Furthermore, it is a way to give publicity to the results achieved in the PECUS Research Network for the general population.ReferencesBARRIGUINHA, A. F.

A considerable portion of these pastures are considered degraded, thus identification and recovery of such areas could result in production gains. In the remote sensing (RS) context, pasturelands have been investigated in order to discriminate intensive and extensive grazing system areas. Intensive systems includes soil and animal management, with pasture fertilization and animal rotation in different paddocks. Extensive grazing systems do not have this management. As RS medium spatial resolu-tion data and field measurements on biomass estimates have strong positive correlation (EDIRISINGHE et al., 2012) future researches points to assess the feasibility on grazing systems discrimination throu-gh temporal analysis.  Thus,  the  objective   of  this  work   was  to  assess  the  Surface  Algorithm       for Evapotranspiration Retrieving (SAFER) potential, applied in with OLI/Landsat-8 images, to discrimina-te intensive and extensive grazing system areas through estimates of above ground biomass.Material and MethodsThe study area is an experimental pasture area in the Cerrado biome, located in Pirassununga, S\u00e3o Paulo state. It consists of six rotational (RGS) and three extensive grazing system (EGS) paddocks (Figure 1).141Landsat-based above ground biomass estimation in pasture area in S\u00e3o Paulo, BrazilLandsat-8 images of the dry and rainy seasons from 2013 to 2015 were used, resulting in 29 cloud-free images. Dry period extends from April to September and wet, from October to March. Cumu-lative precipitation was 1,599.8mm, 1,046mm and 1,612.80m for years 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. Bands 1-7 and thermal bands 10 and 11 were used with climatic data from a weather station located inside of experimental area borders. Schematic flowchart of SAFER algorithm, described by Teixeira et al. (2015), can be observed in Figure 2.Figure 1.

Lower accumulate precipitation values influenced vegetation  production in 2014. As expected, in 2013 and 2015 biomass was higher on rotational than extensive grazing systems on most of images. In dry period, mean biomass for RGS was 48.5, 31.1  and 55.5 kg ha-1 and in extensive grazing system, 26.2, 23.4 and 27.7 kg ha-1 in 2013, 2014 and 015, Figure 2.

Th  experimental design had the following cattle production systems: (A) irrigated with intensive management and high stocking rate (INTIRRI_AL), (B) dryland with intensive management and high stocking rate (INTSEQ_AL) and (C) recovering pasture with medium stocking rate (REC_ML).all pastures were managed in the rotational system.

Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA statistical analysis was applied in order to discriminate each production system in each described period (p<0.05).    Figure 1.

Recovering pasture had also higher mean NDVI value (0.72), than irrigated (0.70) and dryland (0.66) intensive managed pastures, and this can be explained by the cespitose habit of Panicum maximum  grass cultivated in INTIRRI_AL and INTSEQ_AL, which forms clumps, exposing the soil.

In the present study, we performed an estimation of Standardized Vegetation Index (SVI) (Park et al., 2008; Leivas et al., 2014) from 16 days MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) time series of satellite images. The first stage was to identify vegetation anomalies in spring 2012, that means below or above historic NDVI average values in the forest remnants of Zona da Mata region, Atlantic Forest biome, Minas Gerais, Brazil. These anomalies are characterized as variations in vitality of vegetation, classified by NDVI values higher or lower the average values for the analyzed period. The aim of this work was to estimate, classify, and quantify SVI by mapping forest vegetation variation and comparing with remote sensing data about carbon sequestration balance according estimates of net carbon in relation to his proportion in forests, available in literature (Aduan et al., 2004; Amaro et al., 2013; Figueiredo et al., 2015).150Perspectives and scenarios for carbon balance in forest remnants of theAtlantic Forest using remote sensing time seriesMaterial and MethodsThe study area is characterized by semideciduous seasonal forest remnants, and remote sensing-based monitoring allows evaluating the vegetation index variability compared to precipitation records. We analyzed MODIS NDVI series from 2000 to 2012, to derive the SVI. The 16 days NDVI from September 2012 to December 2012 was compared to 2000- 2011 average of same year period. SVI values were classified as below normal, normal, and above normal. The net carbon sequestration was estimated through literature data, considering predominant forest species and forest typology. In this study was classified as predominance of pioneer species for below normal SVI class, with lower potential increase of net carbon (0.5 ton.ha-1.year-1), late secondary species for normal class, with stable conditions of increase (1.5 ton.ha-1.year-1), and early secondary for above normal SVI class, with higher potential increase (2 ton.ha-1.year-1).Results and ConclusionsThe current forest remnants area in the Zona da Mata region (Figure 1) is approximately 400,000 hectares. Based on the methodology proposed in the present study, 5.5% of forest remnant\u2019s total area were classified as below normal, 75% as normal, and 19.5% as above normal SVI considering the first half of September 2012. Along the period in the second half of  October  2012,  17%  were  classified  as  below  normal,  and  17%  above normal SVI. However, in the second half of December 2012 reached 19% as below and 9% above normal SVI, denoting increase in vegetation anomaly compared to average for the period. We conclude that considering the current forest area of the Atlantic Forest remnants in the Zona da Mata, from predominant forest typologies and carbon balance based on literature data, on average, it is estimated 151Perspectives and scenarios for carbon balance in forest remnants of theAtlantic Forest using remote sensing time seriesthat about 587 thousand tons of net carbon will be sequestered by year, approximately, from spring 2012 (Table 1). However, in the second half of December 2012 reached 19% as below and 9% above normal SVI, denoting increase in vegetation anomaly compared to average for the period. We conclude that considering the current forest area of the Atlantic Forest remnants in the Zona da Mata, from predominant forest typologies and carbon balance based on literature data, on average, it is estimated that about 587 thousand tons of net carbon will be sequestered by year, approximately, from spring 2012 (Table 1).

The grassland area allocated to livestock systems is about 170 Mha, with a great variety of production systems adopted on each one of them (IBGE, 2016). Beef production systems have different input of resour-ces and result on different outputs, as beef, money and greenhouse gases (GEE) emissions. Finding promising solutions dealing with the complexity of the drivers of the trade-offs between profit, production and GEE\u00b4s is not trivial. Some authors have evaluated such trade-offs through detailed mathematical models of the technological dynamics in a production system (OLIVEIRA SILVA et al, 2015; 2016).This work uses an alternative approach where the transition of pro-duction systems is modeled. The main objective was to develop a 154An Optimization Model to Deal with Livestock Production and Emissions While Maximizing the Overall Net Revenuelinear programming optimization model with that could represent the dynamics of cattle production system\u2019s adoption, maximizing the total net revenue or family revenue profit over the period on different future scenarios. Those considered a beef demand to be met, the amount of capital available, the maximum GEE emission, while complying with constraints considering the producer\u00b4s low inclination to adopt new technologies.Material and MethodsThe optimization model is a linear integer programing model that seeks to maximize the Brazilian beef cattle net revenue or family revenue (GUIDUCCI et al, 2012) over a designed horizon of time. The model\u00b4s decisions variables include the area allocated to a specific pro-duction system, in a specific Bioma on each year; and the area, on a specific Bioma, which changes from a production system (exit system) to another available system on the model (system adopted).The solution is subject to (I) Meet the annual beef demand projec-ted over the period; (II) Maximum annual greenhouse gases (GEE) emissions (considering soil carbon absorption, emissions by cattle and pasture fertilization) must be lower than a level designated. (III) The demand capital to invest on structure, pasture and animals for land use change, must be lower them the financial resource available.155An Optimization Model to Deal with Livestock Production and Emissions While Maximizing the Overall Net RevenueOther constraints were set to deal with flows among the land use options (the land use on year t is equal to land use on anterior year, plus the amount of land that change from other production systems to this one, minus the land changed from this production system to others). Additionally, a set of constraints was set to allow the model to mimic the fact that, in general, producers are averse to changes. The model then uses three groups of inertia equations: the first one constrains the maximum annual area available for conversion from each production system to all others on the same Bioma (system inertia constraint). The two remaining groups of equations constrains the amount of land available to conversion from other production systems to a specific one (system aversion constraints), the first is based on a percentage of the land already in use on the production system, the second on an absolute value. The model chooses endogenously the equation that allow the greatest land amount available to each production system on each ear. The model also deal with the equilibrium on the supply and demand of calves between the productions systems. The first group of equations balance the supply and demand of male calves between the Amazon\u00b4s production systems. The second deal with the balance of female calves between production systems on Cerrado, Mata Atl\u00e2ntica and Pantanal. The last group deal with the male calves between those systems plus a number of male calves supplied by dairy operations, set as an exogenous parameter.The model was implement on General Algebric Modelling System (GAMS), version 23.7.3, and solved on CPLEX version 12.3.0.Results and ConclusionsThe Picture shows some of the results of the model described herein. On Figure1a it is possible observe an increase in Net Revenue, Family Revenue and beef production, a slightly increase on Soil Carbon, and a greenhouse gases emission\u00b4s (GEE\u00b4s) over time. The emission inten-sity stays stable around 30 MgCO2eq/ton until 2015, and then falls to 156An Optimization Model to Deal with Livestock Production and Emissions While Maximizing the Overall Net Revenue26.5 at the in 2023. Figure 1b illustrates the corresponding allocation of different types of production systems in the solution for the Cerrado Biome.Those results encourage the model\u00b4s use as a tool to analyze public and private policies dealing with livestock revenue, production, invest-ment and emission. The model improvement by the PECUS project\u00b4s research team continues, as its validation aiming to analyze possible trade- offs between GEE\u00b4s goals and investment, and their impact on net and family revenue on some scenarios. Those will consider the in-ternational agreements and perspectives about GEE\u00b4s, income and po-pulation growth, beef and investment demand behavior and producer\u00b4s willing to adopt new technologies.ReferencesFAO.

In quantitative terms, this herd\u2019s greenhou-se gases (GHG) emissions classify it among the five largest enteric methane (CH4) emitters in Brazil. The countrywide assessments and scenarios forecast by Barioni et al. (2007) indicated that the values obtained in 2007 might decrease by 2025 due to better efficiency in beef cattle farming Brazil. Those authors forecast increases by 7.4% in the country\u2019s herd and by 25.4% in meat production in face of enhanced productivity indicators. Meanwhile, methane emissions were estimated to increase by 2.9%, meaning a decrease by 18% per meat unit produced compared to 2007.According to Berndt (2012), there are different strategies to decrease GHG emissions by livestock farming, particularly concerning the activi-ty, nutritional, and reproductive managements, besides the adoption of integrated production systems. Techniques such as crop-livesto-ck-forest (CLF) integration may be adopted so that Par\u00e1 meets those 159IPCC TIER 2 Approach to Estimate Enteric Methane (CH4) Emissions in the Livestock Sector of the Amazon Biomenationwide GHG reduction forecasts. Among the cities in the state, Paragominas stands out for its effort in employing production systems that result in lower GHG emission indicators, supported by the obten-tion of the \u201cGreen City\u201d seal in the Amazon. This study aimed to estimate enteric methane emissions by the beef cattle herd in the state of Par\u00e1 based on TIER 2 of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).Material and MethodsThe data used in the study on the number of cattle heads in the state of Par\u00e1 refer to the period between 2006 and 2015, obtained from the Agriculture and Livestock Defense Agency of Par\u00e1 (ADEPARA). The information on the bromatology of the main forage grasses grown in the state, as well as data regarding supplementation, were taken from the technical- scientific literature. In order to calculate emissions, the methodology developed by the IPCC (IPCC, 2006) was employed using the methodological assumptions of TIER 2 (Table 1). This metho-dology allows estimating emissions for each animal category and is ba-sed on the estimated gross energy and digestible energy intakes while taking into account the energy requirements for maintenance, growth, and activity. The weight of each animal category, mean daily weight gain, diet quality, and production system were analyzed.160IPCC TIER 2 Approach to Estimate Enteric Methane (CH4) Emissions in the Livestock Sector of the Amazon BiomeResults and ConclusionsIt was observed that the total enteric methane emissions differed among  the mesoregions of Par\u00e1. Only the mesoregion comprising the South and Southeast of the state showed an increase in enteric methane emis-sions between 2006 and 2015 since the state\u2019s cattle herd is con-centrated in this region. On the other hand, the lowest enteric methane emission values were found in the mesoregion of the Low Amazon and Maraj\u00f3, where the state\u2019s most expressive buffalo herd is found. In 2006, this value was 0.3 times lower than that obtained in the Bel\u00e9m Metropolitan Area and Par\u00e1 Northeast mesoregion and 0.075 lower than that obtained in the same year for the Southwest and Southeast mesoregion of the state. 2014 and 2015 had the lowest emissions among the nine years analyzed, except in the South and Southeast mesoregion of the state, which had opposite values. Therefore, 2014 had emissions of 302.62 Gg.year-1 while the emissions in 2015 were of 308.36 Gg.year-1(Figure 1). It is concluded that the highest estimated emissions are associated with the mesoregions featuring the largest bovine herd in Par\u00e1 and that the highest emissions took place in 2015. Table 1.

Beef production is the major grassland based activity in Brazil. Therefore, pasture restoration area targets should harmonize with projected demand for beef in order to avoid under and over pro-duction and negative impact on prices. Pasture restoration area has been previously estimated by large mathematical programming models (Oliveira Silva et al., 2016) but the development of a single equation mo-del is useful to improve understanding and transparency of the estima-tes and the interpretation of such large models\u2019 results. The objective of this work is to develop an equation to determine pasture restoration area based on beef demand and to use it to analyze the responses of pasture restoration to their conditioning factors in the Brazilian context.Material and MethodsAn equation to estimate pasture restoration area (R, ha) as function of beef demand (D, kg CWE.yr-1) was deduced as follows.  Let  N be  the  number of animals  (N, heads) in  a   given pasture area. The variation in animal numbers (\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc53 \u2212 \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc56) in a given period can be described by equation (1).\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc53    \u2212 \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc56  = \ud835\udeff\ud835\udc41   + \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc56   \u2212 \ud835\udc41out,                                                                         (1)164An equation to determine demand-constrained pasture restoration areawhere, Ni and Nf are the number of animals at the beginning and at the end of a period of time, respectively; \ud835\udeff\ud835\udc41R  is the difference between the number of animals before and after recovering a pasture area (R, ha); \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc56n  and \ud835\udc41out   are the number of animals in areas where grasslands have expanded and contracted, respectively. Stocking rate (S) is defined as ratio between number of animals and grassland area (A, ha), i.e.  =  , therefore \ud835\udc41 = \ud835\udc34.  . So:\ud835\udeff\ud835\udc41R  = R.   (S\ud835\udc5f  \u2212 S\ud835\udc51) = R.   \ud835\udeffS, and,                         (2)\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc56n  \u2212 \ud835\udc41out  = \ud835\udeff\ud835\udc34.

Beef production is the product of the number of animals and production per animal (C, kg CWE.head-1.yr-1), i.e. D= C.   \ud835\udc41. Note that for the analy-sis herein, C represents the lifecycle average productivity of the herd. The variation in D is due to variations in N and in C as described in equation (5): \ud835\udeffD = \ud835\udeff\ud835\udc41.  C\ud835\udc56  + \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc56.  \ud835\udeffC + \ud835\udeff\ud835\udc41.  \ud835\udeffC             (5)A multiplier P, which is the proportion of production variation due to variation in N is useful to study the pathways of intensification. In a high time resolution, \ud835\udeff\ud835\udc41.  \ud835\udeffC is very small relative to the other two com-ponents (lower than 1/50 for \u0394t = 1yr in the Brazilian conditions).

Results and Conclusions According to Equation 9, the main factors defining the area of pasture restoration are the initial demand and its rate of growth, the overall variation in pasture area, the difference in productivity between recovered degraded areas and the rate of expected variation in animal performance.   Results of a sensitivity analysis of the rate of increase of demand to the specified factors, fixing initial demand (Di) to 10.0 MMT CWE, i.e. approximately the Brazilian current national production. The results highlight the importance of growth in beef demand to achieve the NAMAs target rates of pasture restoration in Brazil and suggest that if a high proportion of production increase is due to animal performance improvement, NAMA restoration targets may turn out to be unattainable (Figure 1). Comparing Figure 1 (a), (b) and (c) it is also possible to evaluate that pasture area expansion may also impair the target achievement.  Applying the expected range of Brazilian beef demand growth rates (1.25 \u2013 2.00 %.yr-1), results presented in Table 1 indicate target rates of pasture restoration in Brazil (1.9 M ha.yr-1) would most likely be achieved in scenarios of pasture area contraction (i.e. \u03b1A < 1.0), associated with moderate levels of improvement of animal performance (\u2264 50% of total productivity gain) and change in productivity of the recovered areas (\u2264 80 kg CWE.ha-1.yr-1).

The emission of large amounts of greenhouse gases has as main factor the fire in the Brazilian Amazon, this arises from different processes such as burning of forests in areas that are being cleared for agriculture and livestock, grazing, forests fire, among others. With the fire, we have the release of gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) (FEARNSIDE, 2002), and these can influence the average temperature rise and hence to global climate change.Thus, more and more there is interest in evaluating and to mo-del the content of chemical components such as Nitrogen (N) in the ground, since if they are stored, are not contributing to the greenhouse effect phenomena.The approach of non-linear models are becoming increasingly common as, for example, in studies by Oliveira et al. (2000) which compares models to describe the growth of female Guzerat, Paz et al. (2004) setting models to study the association between genetic polymor-phisms and growth in cattle and Zeviani et al. (2012) using non-linear models to describe the release of nutrients in the soil, among others.169Nonlinear mixed model applied to the analysis of longitudinal data in a soil located in Paragominas, PAIn this context, statistical approaches with non-linear mixed models be-comes increasingly important to evaluate and explain the nature pheno-mena. Thus, this paper proposes to use this modeling and soil data to explain the dynamics of the stock of carbon and nitrogen over space in areas that have changed management over time.Material and MethodsThe research was conducted at Vit\u00f3ria farm, in the municipality of Paragominas in the southeast  of Par\u00e1 state, bounded by geographical coordinates 2\u00ba59\u201958,37 \u201cSW 47\u00ba21    \u201821.29\u201dW. We studied three different use and land cover patterns: i: pastoral system; ii: agrosilvopastoral system and iii: secondary forest. Soil sam-pling was done in 2013, on occasion opened a trench in each study area, where the samples were collected on three walls between the layers 0-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40, 40-60, 60-80, 80-100, 100-130 and 130-150 cm.For the evaluation of the nitrogen content (g kg-1), soil samples (TFSA) were sieved  through a 0.25mm mesh, macerated and inserted into tin capsules. Subsequently, the samples were analyzed by mass spectrometry in continuous flow on a Carlo Erba CHN 1110 elemental analyzer. These data were used to test non-linear mixed model to des-cribe the average behavior of the nitrogen concentration responses (N) in different production systems, and the area with secondary forest. It  was considered  as a  repeated  measure  in  space (depth)    and heterogeneity of  variances  in  this  space.  In general,  the  content  of N  element  in  the i-th sample (individual), the j-th depth of the u-th system can be represented by yiju   = \u03b20u  xij \u2212\u03b21u + \u03b5iju , where xij  is the i-th sample (i = 1, ..., N), in jth depth (j = 1, ..., ni). In terms of mixed models, one has to yiju   = \u03b20u xij    \u2212(\u03b21u +b1i ) + \u03b5iju ,  where  \u03b20u   is  the  average  value  of the  content  of study  in the system, \u03b21u is the accumulation rate this content, b1i is the random effect 170Nonlinear mixed model applied to the analysis of longitudinal data in a soil located in Paragominas, PAassociated with \u03b21u, independent and identically distributed as N(0, \u03c32b) and \u03c3iju is  the random error  associated with yiju, independent and identically distributed as N(0, \u03c3 2\u03b5), and independent of b1i. Thus, the random effect enters as non-linearly in the model.Results and ConclusionsThere was high variability in the upper layers of nitrogen content in the soil.  We  tested several models, from the likelihood ratio test by modifying structures of intra- individual covariates matrix. After mo-difications, it could be verified that the model with power function of variances was the best one that suited to the data.Figure 1: Observed values and fitted model to the nitrogen content of data per depth and sample171Nonlinear mixed model applied to the analysis of longitudinal data in a soil located in Paragominas, PAReferencesANDERSON, J.

Integrated crop-livestock-forestry systems aim at greater sustainability at the farm, and incorporate agricultural, livestock and/or forestry components within the same area under crop rotation, double cropping or sequential cropping (BALBINO et al., 2011). Thus, in this study we evaluated the effect of different livestock production systems on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). On one side, the greenness represented by NDVI values correlates with plant production to indicate stronger or weaker production, and also to act as an indicator to distinguish the types of management of livestock systems (ALVARENGA et al., 2015). On the other side, biomass production in pastures co relates with pote tial for ca bon storage in the soil (OLIVEIRA, 2015).  Material and Methods Th  s udy area is located in S\u00e3o Carl s, S\u00e3o Paulo State, Brazil, within the Mata Atl\u00e2ntica (Atlantic Forest) biome, a region of humid subtropical climate where the average annual rainfall rate is of 1,362 mm, and the average annual temperature rate is of 21.5 \u00b0C. The experimental outline featured the following bovine cattle production systems: (A) crop-livestock-forest integration (iLPF), (B) livestock-forest integration (iPF), (C) crop-liv stock integration (iLP); (D) intensive (INT) and (E) low-density extensive (EXT_BL) breeding (Figure 1). The ILPF and iPF systems feature Eucalyptus urograndis (GG100) in simple rows sp ced b  15 m and trees space  by 2 m. The pastures feature Urochloa brizantha. Currently 1/3 of the area is renovated using Zea mays double-cropped with U. brizantha (Table 1).  Table 1. Description of the experimental areas and livestock production systems.

As expected, the iLPF system showed higher vegetation indices along all seasons (Table 2). The permanent presence of the forest conveys stability to the vegetation indices\u2019 values and a stronger greenness. Nevertheless, the NDVI values of the iPF system were lower than those of the iLPF system, despite the equal presence of trees in both of them (Table 2). This difference might be associated with the stronger fertilization applied to the iLPF system, since a maize crop was part of the rotation, and the sys-tem may have benefited from the residual effect of the nutrients in the soil.Figure 1.

In general, the use of pastures is characterized by extractivism, with few producers who invest in the recovery of the productive potential of pastures and adop-ting less  impactful technologies to the environment. Thus, the inten-sification of pastoral production systems can be adopted as a viable option to minimize the pressure on opening new areas of agricultural production and reduce the emission of gases causing the greenhouse effect (Barcellos et al., 2008). However, identify areas of pasture that have low production potential can be one of the challenges for large--scale implementation of efficient government policies with the adop-tion of strategic mitigation measures. In this context, remote sensing data can assist with relevant information for decision making in various scales of time and space. Given the above, aimed to apply data from WorldView-2 sensor and meteorological data to estimate the biomass of pasture areas.Material and MethodsThis study was conducted in the experimental area of GeoPecus pro-ject located in the farm of Embrapa Southeast Livestock, S\u00e3o Carlos, 178Estimation biomass of pasture areas using WorldView-2 dataBrazil. Therefore, daily meteorological data collected in the weather station of the National Institute of Meteorology (INMET) and World-View-2 image (2013/08/25) were used. Initially, steps radiometric calibration and estimation the surface reflectance with the correction of atmospheric effects by MODTRAN algorithm were carried. Then we calculated the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) (Rouse et al., 1973) and applied the simple linear regression model propo-sed by Kamble et al. (2013) for estimating crop coefficient (Kc):KcNDVI   = 1.457 \u00d7 NDVI \u2212 0,1725  (3)To estimate the crop evapotranspiration (ETc, millimeters per day) used the equation:ETC  = KcNDVI   \u00d7 ETo(4)Where, ETo is the reference evapotranspiration (millimeters per day), estimated by the Penman-Monteith method, detailed in the bulletin of FAO N\u00ba 56 (Allen et al., 1998).The vegetation biomass was estimated by the equation:BIO = \u2211 (\u03b5 max \u00d7 E f  \u00d7 APAR \u00d7 0.864)(5)Where, BIO is the accumulation of biomass of vegetation (kg ha-1), \u03b5max   is the maximum efficiency of the use of radiation, was considered the value of 2.5 g MJ-1  (Bastiaanssen e  Ali, 2003), Ef  is the ratio of the latent heat flux ( \u03bbE , em W m-2) and net radiation (W m-2) (Teixeira et al., 2012). In this case,   \u03bbE variable was estimated by the evapotranspiration  of culture (ETc), transforming millimeters per day in watts per square meter. Net radiation was calculated using the daily data collected from the weather station. APAR parameter is the absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (W m-2), estimated by the equation (Teixeira et al., 2009):APAR = (\u2212 0.161 +1.257 \u00d7 NDVI )\u00d7 0,44 \u00d7 RG(6)179Estimation biomass of pasture areas using WorldView-2 dataWhere, RG is the global solar radiation (W m-2) and 0.44 is the scalar used in the estimation of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR).Results and ConclusionsWe observed that the biomass above soil ranged from 0 to 7000 kg/ha month (Figures 1a and 1b). Biomass values estimated between 500 and 2000 kg/ha month were predominant. However, in some cases, values greater than 4000 kg/ha month (green tones) were mainly observed in representative areas of tree canopy. Biomass values pre-dominantly lower than 1100 kg/ha month (August and September) and greater than 1500 kg/ha month (June and July) were estima-ted by Andrade et al. (2015) in pastures areas in the municipality of Aquidauana, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. Mean values 2200 kg/ha of total biomass were observed by Zanchi et al. (2009) in pastures of Rond\u00f4nia State. In this case, the pastures had well-defined seasonal cycle with influence of climatic variations and water availability in the soil. The authors also report that the intensity of grazing can reduce or enhance the growth of forage.By analyzing estimates biomass of pastures with indicative of degra-dation, Andrade et al.

Preliminarily, it can be concluded that the technique has great potential for application in biomass quantification studies of pastures.ReferencesALLEN, R. G.; PEREIRA, L. S.; RAES, D.; SMITH, M.

E-mail address of presenting author*: albertinitz@techagr.comIntroductionThe database for beef cattle real time individual monitoring asses-sed by decision support system (DSS) should provide a fast identifi-cation of more profitable animals in the future. Animals identification with information about their optimal economical endpoint (OEE; most profitable  slaughter  date)  in  commercial  beef  cattle  feedlots  owned  by  farmers  could minimize pollutants by kg of meat. This study aimed to identify the OEE in cattle. The hypothesis  of  the  study  was:  traditional  slaughter  endpoint  (TSE,  currently  used  in commercial feedlots) vs. OEE methods have different marginal net profit (MNV), GHG emission, water intake and manure produc-tion per kg of meat produced. The current study is the first from three sequential abstracts based on BeefTrader DSS to maximize profitability of farmers and the meat industry.183BeefTader (part I): optimal economical endpoint identification using mixed modeling approach decreases greenhouse gases emission and other pollutants for livestock farmersMaterial and MethodsFeedlot   data   from   experimental   dataset   [DS1;   formed   by   variables:   diet   chemical composition, intake, daily weight gain and body composition] was used to parameterize a growth  model.  Based  on  DS1  a  second  dataset  (DS2)  was  created  using  exogenous information (i.e., commercial prices, GHG emission fac-tors, manure and water functions) to predict OEE, MNV, GHG, water intake and manure production. Data was analyzed for the following procedures: i) DS1: after weaning (225 \u00b1 14 days) data from 30 crossbred cattle [10 Red Angus \u00d7 Nellore (5 male, M; 5 female, F) and 20 \u00bd Red Angus \u00d7 \u00bc Caracu \u00d7 Nellore (10 M; 10 F)] evalua-ted in individual stalls (mixed diet: 2.84 Mcal ME/kg DM, 13.9% CP). Animals were slaughtered when they reached ~ 6 mm of subcuta-neous fat in the 12-13th ribs (feedlot maximum period was 147 days); ii) DS2 (exogenous information): the MNV, R$/day (marginal value \u2013 marginal cost, MV - MC) from market prices and animal data ob-served (DS1) was predicted. The daily weight gain (DWG, kg/d) \u00d7 weight gain value (R$/kg) and DM  intake  (DMI,  kg  MS/day)  \u00d7  diet price  (R$/kg)  +  overhead  (R$/day)  were  used  to calculate MV and MC, respectively. Manure (kg/day) production from diet indigestibili-ty was estimated. Water intake (kg/day) according to Hicks et al. (1998) was calculated. Enteric methane (kg CH4/day) and manure (kg N2O and CH4) emissions converted in CO2 equivalent (CO2-eq) were estimated according to Medeiros et al. (2014) and IPCC Tier 2 metho-dology, respectively; iii) DS2 (animal growth and body chemical com-position modeling): the system of differential equations using Davis Growth Model to represent cattle growth parameterized by Biase et al. (2016) were used to predict daily shrunk BW gain (kg/d) and fat de-position [% fat in the empty body weight (EBW)] during the feedlot. The TSE method was performed considering all the feedlot experi-mental period, however, OEE period was based on positive MNV va-lues; iv) statistical analysis: using SAS (SAS Inst. Inc., Cary, NC) two linear mixed- effect (LME) model were created: using DS1 variables, the LME1 was created using effects [gender, breed (M; F), gender 184BeefTader (part I): optimal economical endpoint identification using mixed modeling approach decreases greenhouse gases emission and other pollutants for livestock farmers\u00d7 breed interaction and pre-weaning phase (system)] as fixed. The LME2 was created using the same fixed effects structure as LME1, however; method levels (OEE; TSE) and interaction (method \u00d7 gender) to analyze DS2 was included. The least square means and probabili-ties were performed by SAS lsmeans statement, including gender and method effects for DS1 (by LME1) and DS2 (by LME2). Approximate t test was used to test the null hypothesis and the probability between TSE and OEE.Results and ConclusionsThe least square means (\u00b1 standard error, SE) feedlot period, DM intake, initial and final shrunk BW (SBW), BW  gain, slaughter backfat thickness, final fat concentration in the EBW  (for F, M, respectively) were: 81, 115 \u00b1 9 days; 7.7, 8.7 \u00b1 0.30 kg DMI/day; 284, 329 \u00b1 8.80kg; 375, 489 \u00b1 10.1 kg; 1.17, 1.45 \u00b1 0.063 kg/day; 8, 5 \u00b1 0.50 mm; 19, 16 \u00b1 0.3% fat EBW. After elimination of negative values for daily MNV based on each animal (Figure 1) to calculate OEE the values for study variables were predicted and analyzed. Figure 1. Left side (A): the daily economic performance during feedlot is presented based on marginal value (MV, R$/day), marginal cost (MC, R$/day) and marginal net value (MNV = MV \u2013 MC; R$/day) for a Red Angus \u00d7 Nello-re female (ID 941). Dashed red lines intersection indicates  (red  rectangle)  the  negative  daily  MNV  removed  to  calculate  the  optimal economical endpoint period. Right side (B): greenhouse gases emission (CO2-eq/day), ma-nure production (kg DM/day); water intake (l/day) and marginal net value (R$/day) for animal ID  941.185BeefTader (part I): optimal economical endpoint identification using mixed modeling approach decreases greenhouse gases emission and other pollutants for livestock farmersThe profitability increased (2 to 6 times) based on marginal net value/DWG ratio (R$/kg gain). The GHG emission and the manure production were minimized in 2 to 3 times while water demand 3 to 4 times (Table 1), regardless of the gender in the methods, where OEE was better (P < 0.05).Thus, BeefTrader mathematical and statistical models based on indivi-dual growth identification, coupled with optimal economical endpoint decision, improved the profitability and reduced environmental impacts when compared with current experimental dataset. However, what is the influence of BeefTrader metrics over optimal economical endpoint in commercial feedlots of livestock producers in the farm boundary?

E-mail address of presenting author*: adrielegbiase@gmail.comIntroductionNowadays there is no decision support system (DSS) that monitor individuals on real time during their growth based on optimal economi-cal endpoint (OEE) in large commercial feedlot operations.  This  chal-lenge  will  be  overcome  by  this  study  based  on  nonparametric bootstrapping technique to create a large synthetic population to test the following hypothesis: traditional  slaughter  endpoint  (TSE)  vs.  OEE  methods  have  different  marginal  profit, greenhouse  gases  emission  (GHG),  water  intake  and  manure  production  by kg  of  meat produced. This simulation study is relevant not just to test this hypothesis, but to evaluate if environmental and economic bene-fits from OEE animal identification in an experimental scenario is also observed in a large commercial feedlot. The current study is the second from three sequential abstracts based on BeefTrader DSS to 188BeefTrader (part II): optimal economical endpoint identification using nonparametric bootstrapping technique decreases greenhouse gases emission and other pollutants in feedlotsmaximize profitability of farmers and the meat industry.Material and MethodsIn the BeefTrader (part I) abstract two datasets (DS) were created. The DS1 was formed by experimental feedlot variables (diet chemical composition, intake, daily weight gain and body chemical composition). The system of differential equations proposed by Oltjen et al. [1986, 2000, named Davis Growth Model (DGM)] reparameterized by Biase et al. (2016) were used to predict the animal growth and body chemical composition. Variables from DGM, exogenous information (i.e., com-mercial prices, GHG emission factors, manure and water functions) to predict OEE, marginal net value, GHG, water intake and manure produc-tion constitute the DS2.  Nonparametric bootstrap (NB) resampling was used to create a synthetic population DS3 from DS1 and DS2. The NB performed 100,000 resampling nonparametric for each experimental unit and the confidence of biased corrected percentile bootstrap was determined using the R software (Development Core Team, version 3.1.0, 2014). The mean, median, lower and upper limit were calculated from NB. Biased corrected percentile booststrap interval (95% confiden-ce level) was used to compare the methods from DS3 according to its symmetric and asymmetric distributions probabilities (Efron, 1981).Results and ConclusionsThere was no overlap for confidence intervals for all female variables evaluated (Figure 1). In this situation, there was difference (P < 0.05) where OEE was confirmed as the best method bring direct benefits for economic and environmental variables analysed. Similar behavior was identified by males where OEE improved the identification of less impactful environmentally population (P < 0.05), however, marginal net value (MNV) was similar between the methods. It is important to highlight that median is considered the best distribution symmetric and asymmetric estimator. Based on median, the accumulated MNV/daily weight gain ratio was 91 and 27 R$/kg to OEE and TSE (more 189BeefTrader (part II): optimal economical endpoint identification using nonparametric bootstrapping technique decreases greenhouse gases emission and other pollutants in feedlots Results and Conclusions 45 Ther  was no overlap for confidence int rvals for all emale variables evaluated (Figure 1).

E-mail address of presenting author*: albertinitz@techagr.comIntroductionFeedlots rented or belonging to meat packers are increasing in Bra-zil and about half million cattle was produced on such feedlots in 2014. On the other side, the meat packers buy a significant quan-tity of cattle (~ 5 millions animals/year) from other feedlots. In-dependent if animals have being finished in livestock producers or meat packers feedlot, the individual monitoring based on the optimal economical endpoint (OEE) should improve the profitability decreasing greenhouse gases emission (GEE) and others pollutants for both sides of this market chain. However, the maximization of profitability is central for OEE, and the challenge is to solve it for meat packer, as the margi-nal value is calculated from carcass and non-carcass tissues deposition 192BeefTrader (part III): meat industry opportunity to improve its profitability reducing greenhouse gases emission and pollutants based on optimal economical endpoint identificationover time. Additionally, the marginal cost need to consider operational costs from industry, logistics (from farm-industry-final customer) and maintenance stocks (in or out of industry boundaries). The aim of this study was evaluate the economic and environmental benefits to meat packers based on OEE individual identification. The hypothesis of this study was: traditional slaughter endpoint (TSE) vs. OEE have di-fferences for marginal profit, GHG emission and manure production by kg of meat produced in the meat industry boundary. The current study is the third from three sequential abstracts based on BeefTrader DSS to maximize profitability of farmers and the meat industry.Material and MethodsIn the BeefTrader (part I) abstract two datasets (DS) were created. The DS1 was formed by experimental feedlot variables (diet chemical composition, intake, daily weight gain and body chemical composi-tion). The Davis Growth Model (DGM; Oltjen et al. 1986, 2000) reparametrized by Biase (2016) was used to predict the animal gro-wth and body chemical composition. Variables from DGM, exogenous information to predict OEE, GHG, water intake and manure production performed the DS2. The DS2 was used to simulate the carcass and non- carcass growing during the feedlot than DS3 was created. Main Brazilian meat cuts according MAPA (1988) and non-carcass commer-cial tissues (skin, liver, heart, kidney, rumen-reticulum, tong and internal fat) were modeled. The meat cuts:carcass and non-carcass:empty body weight ratios simulated in DGM were used to model these tissues deposition over time. The relative cuts and tissues weights were multi-plied by prices performed by industry to predict the marginal value daily. Nonparametric bootstrap (NB) resampling was used to create a synthetic population DS4 from DS1, DS2 and DS3. The NB performed 100,000 resampling nonparametric for each experimental unit and the confiden-ce of biased corrected percentile bootstrap was determined using the R software (Development Core Team, version 3.1.0, 2014). The mean, median, lower and upper limit were calculated from NB. Biased correc-ted percentile booststrap interval (95% confidence level) was used to 193BeefTrader (part III): meat industry opportunity to improve its profitability reducing greenhouse gases emission and pollutants based on optimal economical endpoint identificationcompare the methods from DS3 according its symmetric and asym-metric distributions probabilities (Efron, 1981).Results and ConclusionsThe OEE economic and environmental benefits for producers can also be observed for meat packers the same way as observed in the situations portrayed in the previous studies (BeefTrader part I and II). However, the simulation of this study shows that the impact on retail prices paid by the meat and internal tissues had a great influence on profitability. Logistics and stocks, national and international customers tendencies, business rules understanding (among farmer-industry--customer) are essential to be implemented in a more realistic model to maximize the profitability.ReferencesBIASE, A.G.

The importance of beef cattle production in Brazil is evi-denced by its share in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In 2013, its participation in the agribusiness GDP was 39.94%. Changes in the demand for beef cattle have been driven by the human population growth rate, income growth, and urbanization. The response of the different livestock systems has been the incorporation of science and technology and the consequent increase of productive indexes. On the other hand, livestock production is likely to be in-creasingly affected by policies related to the mitigation of greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions, i.e the \u2018decarbonization\u2019 of livestock systems, besides the animal welfare legislation and other environmental cons-traints (Thornton, 2010).Two types of efficiency may be identified in a production system: technical and economical (Ferreira & Gomes, 2009). One production system may be considered technically efficient if no other system is able to achieve the same level of production by using less quantity 196Greenhouse gas emissions intensity assessment in beef cattle production systems: a data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach with variable returns to scaleof at least one input. Economic efficiency is achieved if there is no other alternative production system that produces the same amount at a lower cost or with a higher profit margin.This paper aims at evaluating the efficiency of beef cattle productive systems in the Cerrado, Pampa and Pantanal biomes, regarding their emissions intensity (CO2 equivalent per kilogram of carcass weight produced).Material and MethodsPrimary data were collected by means of the panel system, with the definition of representative properties, according to Plaxico and Tweeten (1963). Despite the difficulty to characterize production systems that may be viewed as representative of the biomes stu-died, the method searches, through the experience of the participating producers, to characterize the ones that are most commonly found in the region, at different levels of technology (Pereira & Costa, 2014; Crespolini, et al., 2015).Ten beef cattle modal production systems applied in the three biomes (Cerrado, Pampa, Pantanal) were analyzed. The data came from the Pecus Project. Five systems are located in the Cerrado (Cerrado_B\u00e1si-co_05; Cerrado_B\u00e1sico_12; Cerrado_Intermedi\u00e1rio_12; Cerrado me-lhorado a pasto - SM3; Cerrado melhorado com confinamento -SM4); three in the Pampa (Pampa_Extensivo; Pampa_Semi-Intensivo; Pam-pa_Intensivo); and two in the Pantanal (Pantanal_tradicional; Panta-nal_30).The emissions were calculated according to the IPCC tier 1 and tier 2 default models implemented in the \u201cPECUS Emissions Model\u201d sprea-dsheet. The indicator used was the emission intensity (kg CO2-e / kg of carcass for slaughter) in each of the systems analyzed.We performed data envelopment analysis (DEA) for the efficiency  197Greenhouse gas emissions intensity assessment in beef cattle production systems: a data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach with variable returns to scaleanalysis, using Linear Programming. The objective was to determi-ne the efficiency of productive units, called decision making units or DMUs, with information about the levels of resources employed and results achieved. The same method has been previously applied in analyses of beef cattle production systems (Abreu et al., 2008; Go-mes, et al., 2015).In this analysis, the objective was to verify the relative efficiency of the alterative production systems in minimizing the gas emission. We established three input variables: total pasture areas (native and cultivated), number of breeding cows, and number of bulls, and one product variable (output), that is, the emission intensity (kg CO2-e/ kg of carcass for slaughter). The inverse of the intensity was defined as output as the objective was to evaluate the product decrease (emis-sions).We chose to apply the VRS input-oriented mode, which considers variable returns to scale in order to minimize the resources while keeping the production levels unchanged (Cooper et al., 2006).Results and ConclusionsTable 1 shows the results of DEA modeling with the variable returns to scale model.Table 1.

The DMU operates in optimal scale, and the production decrease occurs while keeping the factor use proportion.The seven systems (five in the Cerrado Biome and two in the Pampa) evaluated operate in descending return and are inefficient in the scale. Therefore, they are operating above the optimal scale and they probably have technical inefficiency. These systems will have to eliminate the excessive use of inputs, which means to produce more with the same inputs. Alternatively, they will have to improve the technology, by increasing the factor productivity. The two systems in the Pantanal Biome operate below the optimal scale. It is necessa-ry to increase production so that the relations between the quanti-ties of inputs used and the production volume may be reduced.The use of the DEA modeling enables the performance analysis of the DMUs with multidimensional perspective in different situations, by means of the functional relations between inputs and products. The study of the GHG emissions in livestock systems with the use of DEA will lead to evaluating the strategies\u2019 technical efficiency, productivity and effectiveness to minimize them.ReferencesABREU, U.G.P.; GOMES, E.

In these systems, pasture-crop rotation cultivation between tree alleys, under proper management, promote consistent improvement of aspects like plant production, animal husbandry, environment and society.Brazil has high potential for implementation of integrated production systems, which demonstrating high efficiency in improving the soil quality, control pests and diseases, control of weeds, in the use of by-products of different crops, in addition to making the cash flow more frequent, creating new jobs and giving greater sustainability in agricultural production.The adoption of ICLF systems is one of the alternatives to achie-ve sustainability of production systems, especially with regard to the reduction of greenhouse gases (GHGs). This is due to the high produc-tion of tropical grasses and organic matter accumulation in the soil in recovered grazing systems. Another point is the introduction of tree component, which has high potential carbon sequestration and GHG 201Potential of environmental services of eucalyptus on integrated production systems mitigation, which reflecting in higher use efficiency of land and envi-ronmental services.Thus, the objective of this research was evaluated the productivity and the potential environmental services of the tree component in two spatial arrangements.Material and MethodsThe experiment was carried out at the Embrapa Beef Cattle research center in Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul State, Brazil, located between the geographical coordinates: 20\u00ba27\u201902\u201d S and 54\u00ba43\u201907\u201d W.. Soil was a distroferric red latosol (LVdf), Climate under K\u00f6ppen classification is a transition zone between Cfa and Aw wet tropical. Mean annual rainfall is 1,560 mm, with rainy summer and a dry light cold winter.A randomized block design was used, with two treatments and four re-petitions. Treatments consisted of two spatial arrangements: (1) single rows of eucalyptus trees with 14 meters between rows and 2 meters between trees in the row (14 m \u00d7 2 m), totaling 357 trees ha-1 and (2) single rows of eucalyptus trees with 22 meters between rows and 2 meters between trees in the row (22 m \u00d7 2 m), totaling 227 trees ha-1.Brachiaria brizantha cv. BRS Piat\u00e3 was used as cattle pasture be-tween Eucalyptus urophylla x Eucalyptus grandis trees (clone H13) in the rows. Prior to experiment implementation, there was Brachia-ria sp. in the area, with low stocking rates. The area was reclaimed in September-October 2008 using crop-livestock-forest integration system (iLPF) with tillage and soybeans farming. Eucalyptus seedlin-gs were transplanted in January 2009 and the Piat\u00e3 grass was no-till sown over soybeans crop residues in April 2010.Measurements of total height and diameter at breast height (DBH) were performed at 48 months after planting. From the height and DBH 202Potential of environmental services of eucalyptus on integrated production systems data, the volume of timber per plant was calculated (using the form factor equal to 0.5, and commercial height of 75% total height) as well as was the volume of timber per hectare, using the equation proposed by Porf\u00edrio-da- Silva et al. (2009).The carbon content on stem was determined using CN analyzer (Sumika Chemical Sumigraph CN 900), according to methodology employed by Kanda et al. (2004). CO2  eq. was estimated using a conversion factor of 3.67. To determine the neutralizing capacity of the GHGs from cattle, it was considered that an animal unit produces 1.88t CO2 eq per year.Analysis of variance was carried out and, when there were significant differences up to 5% significance between means, these means were compared by Scott Knott test with 5% probability, using SISVAR software (Ferreira, 2008).Results and ConclusionsSpacing arrangements did not affect individual production performance of trees until 86 months after planting (Table 1), therefore, there was no significant difference in the silvicultural performance characteristic. In general, increase in diameter is a highly responsive characteristic of spacing (Bernardo, 1995), however, when using broader spacing, as tested in this work, it is expected to detect the influence of these spacing on the DBH in older plants. The same author states that height has no direct correlation with spacing as there are cases where there is increased when larger spacing and others in which the result is the opposite. In this work, there was not detected influence of spacing on height measurements until 86 months after planting s, probably due to large distance between tree rows adopted.The volume of timber per plant is highly influenced by the height and DBH characteristics, no differences were evident for these two 203Potential of environmental services of eucalyptus on integrated production systems characteristics, so no statistical differences in the volume of timber per plant. neutralization potential regarding GHG emissions from cattle (PNEB), as demonstrated by the results shown in Table 2.

Higher tree density provides  higher carbon fixation, and therefore, the greater will be the mitigation of the GHGs produced by cattle. In the 14 m x 2 m spatial arrangement, carbon fixed until 86 months was sufficient to neutralize the greenhouse gas emissions from 12.7 animals (weighting 450 kg LW) per hectare per year. For the 22 m x 2 m spatial arrangement, carbon fixed is enough to mitigate the greenhouse gases emission from 7.6 animals (with 450 kg) per hectare per year. In this context, since degraded pastures have average stocking rates under 1.0 animal unit per hectare per year, there will be a carbon surplus set by integrated systems. Thus it can be concluded that the spatial arrangements used did not influence individual development of eucalyptus trees until 86 months after planting and tree density increased wood productivity per area and consequently the potential for environmental services in agroforestry systems.

In extensive grazing systems where external inputs are absent, grazing intensity (stoking rate/forage biomass) is the main management factor that influence livestock production efficiency. Moderate grazing intensities are generally recognized to optimize livestock productivity while limiting CH4 emissions (Gerber et al., 2011; Hristov et al., 2013). Native grazing ecosystems are wides-pread over all continents. They have great economical value through livestock production, particularly in the developing countries of South America (e.g. Argentine, Uruguay, Brazil) that are highly dependent upon this activity (FAO, 2010). When well managed, native grazing ecosystems have the potential to add large amounts of carbon into the soil (>500 kg CO2 eq yr-1 ha-1, Henderson et al. 2016). Howe-ver, technical information for grazing management in South American native grassland are sparsely. Such information are particularly  im-portant  to  improve  productivity,  enabling  economic  development  while preserving natural environments. The aim of this work is to discuss the pattern of animal productivity and methane emissions un-der different grazing intensities in a beef production system in South Brazilian\u2019s native grassland.206Grazing intensity as a strategy to mitigate methane in native grasslandMaterial and MethodsThe experiment was conducted at the Agronomical Experimental Station of the Federal University of the Rio Grande do Sul, Southern Brazil. This long-term experiment, kept since 1986, involves continuous stocking of heifers on native grassland under different forage allowances (FA, the inverse of grazing intensity). Stoking rate was adjusted monthly to maintain different levels of forage allowances (1, 2, 2-3, 3 and 4 kg of DM.ha-1 per kg LW.ha-1) in different paddocks. The forage allowance 2-3 kg DM/kg LW was adjusted with 2 kg DM/kg LW during spring and 3 kg DM/kg LW during the rest of the year. The experimental design was a randomized complete block with two repetitions of each FA. We estimated CH4 emission from six cows per treatment (2.5 years old in average) using the SF6 marker technique. Methane emissions were collected over periods of 5 days for the summer, autumn, winter and spring of 2012 to represent emissions over all year round.Results and ConclusionsThe forage allowance of 4 kg DM/kg LW represent a very low gra-zing intensity with few animals per ha and was choose as a reference level here. From this reference level, increasing grazing intensity (or lowering forage allowance) result in direct increase of stoking rate and consequently a quasi-linear increase in CH4 emissions per ha. The increase in grazing intensity also resulted in a relatively constant decrease in NAPP. On the other hand, moderate grazing intensities (i.e. FA 2-3) optimizes both animal daily gain and animal productivity per ha. Passing this moderate level of grazing intensity, all productive variables decreased while CH4 emissions continue to increase. Here, moderate grazing intensities represent a simple management technic to mitigate CH4 emissions while optimizing animal productivity and so being economical viability, with durable effects in time and space.207Grazing intensity as a strategy to mitigate methane in native grassland\t \u00a0consequently a quasi-linear increase in CH4 emissions per ha.

It are the main feed basis for beef cattle production systems in Southern Brazil. It is characterized by a great diversity of species with approximately 3000 rangeland species only in Rio Grande do Sul state (Setubal and Boldrini, 2010). However, one of the most distinct characteristic of this rangeland is the co-existence of C3 and C4 species (Overbeck et al., 2007). The data about metha-ne emission in this environment are few. This work aimed evaluating methane emission (CH4) per animal and live weight gain per area (LWG.ha-1) by finishing beef steers on natural grasslands with different levels of intensification.Material and MethodsThe experiment was carried out at Embrapa Southern Livestock, Bag\u00e9, RS, Brazil. Three plots of 7 ha natural grasslands were assigned to each of the three treatments: (i) natural grassland (NG); (ii) NG plus fertilization (NGF): 35 kg ha-1 P2O5 and 50 kg N ha-1, twice a year; 210How are the methane emissions in beef steers grazing natural grassland in southern Brazil?every year between 2005 to 2014; and (iii) NGF plus overseeded with Lolium multiflorum and Trifolium pratense (NGFS).

Methane emissions (CH4, g.day-1) were measured using the sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) technique. Evaluations were made in 2014, in the winter (August, 4-9), and spring (December, 1-6).

It are the main feed basis for beef cattle production systems in Southern Brazil. It is characterized by a great diversity of species with approximately 3000 rangeland species only in Rio Grande do Sul state (Setubal and Boldrini, 2010). However, one of the most distinct characteristic of this rangeland is the co-existence of C3 and C4 species (Overbeck et al., 2007). The data about methane emission in this environment are few. This work aimed evaluating methane emission (CH4) per animal and live weight gain per area (LWG.ha-1) by finishing beef steers on natural grasslands with different levels of intensification.   Material and Methods The experiment was carried out at Embrapa Southern Livestock, Bag\u00e9, RS, Brazil. Three plots of 7 ha natural grasslands were assigned to each of the three treatments: (i) natural grassland (NG); (ii) NG plus fertilization (NGF): 35 kg ha-1 P2O5 and 50 kg N ha-1, twice a year; every year between 2005 to 2014; and (iii) NGF plus overseeded with Lolium multiflorum and Trifolium pratense (NGFS). Pastures had been under continuous grazing by yearling Hereford steers with constant intensity of 12 kg forage DM per 100 kg live weight. Three \u201ctest\u201d animals (nine animals per treatment) were in the paddocks for a whole year and grazing intensity was adjusted with oth r steers.

Among the cultivated grasses, the genus Brachiaria, which occupies approximately 60 million hectares, constitutes the main option for feeding beef cattle in the country (S\u00c1 et al., 2011), especially in the growing stages, however observed a lower performance, in particular when supplementation is not used. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of two genetic groups during the growing stage with supplementation. We evaluated the performance of the genetic groups \u00bd Nelore \u00bd Angus and \u00bc Nelore \u00bc Angus \u00bd Guzer\u00e1, which originate from the rotational crosses of Nelore cows mated with Angus bulls and \u00bd Nelore \u00bd Angus cows mated with Guzer\u00e1 bulls, respectively.Material and MethodsThe average weight during yearling stage of 10 animals were used for each genetic group, \u00bd Nelore \u00bd Angus and \u00bc Nelore \u00bc Angus 214Use of supplemented pasture during the yearling stage to growth performance of NeloreAngus and Nelore Angus Guzera crossbreed cows contributing to carbon sequestration\u00bd Guzera. The animals were kept in pastures with Brachiaria brizantha cv. Marandu, fertilized with 120 kg ha-1  ano-1 of N. The experiment site located in Realeza, PR, in the south-west of Paran\u00e1, 25\u00b0 46 \u201808\u201d South Latitude and 53\u00ba 31\u2019 57\u201d West Longitude and altitude of 520 m, the average environmental temperature was 23 \u00b0C and  the  average  monthly  precipitation  was  above  120  mm.  The  forage  allowance  were administered at a rate of 2.5 kg of DM per 100 kg live weight; for this, control cattle was used with the technique \u2018put and take\u2019 and the pasture area was controlled with a mobile fence. The average levels of DM, CP, NDF, and ADF in forage in the growing stage under grazing were 266,  75,  530,  and  420  g  kg-1,  respectively.  The  animals  received  protein  and  energy supplementation ad libitum (NDT-750, PB-240, P-5,2, Ca-2,4, and EE-33 g kg-1). During the growing stage in the yearling, the animals were weighed monthly. The results were submitted to analysis of variance, using the Sisvar program (FERREIRA, 2011) and regression analysis, the significance of the regression coefficients of 1 and 5% was determined using a t-test.Results and ConclusionsThe average weight function of time obtained monthly during the yearling stage and adjusted to the linear model (Figure 1), considering the significance of the regression coefficients. L\u00f4bo e Martins filho (2002) compared various models, which describe the growth of Nelore beef cattle, and reported that although the nonlinear models de Richards (R2=0.99) and Brody (R2=0.99) have a better fit, the quality of the fit of the linear model (R2=0.97) is similar to that of nonlinear models. The genetic group \u00bc Nelore \u00bc Angus \u00bd Guzer\u00e1 showed greater average weight. However, for the group \u00bd Nelore \u00bd Angus had the highest regression coefficient (b), which demonstrates a higher estimated daily gain. It is possible to obtain appropriate weights of the animals maintained in  pastures with Brachiaria brizantha cv. Marandu with supplementation to animals \u00bd Nelore \u00bd Angus and \u00bc Nelore \u00bc Angus \u00bd Guzera, contributing to carbon sequestration.215Use of supplemented pasture during the yearling stage to growth performance of NeloreAngus and Nelore Angus Guzera crossbreed cows contributing to carbon sequestrationReferencesFERREIRA, D.

Several factors influence the amount of methane produced per animal such as nutrition, the type of carbohydrate in the diet, the level of feed intake, level of production (annual production of milk, meat and other products), diet passage rate, level of fat saturation in the diet, some environmental factors such as temperature and genetics and feed conversion efficiency (Mcallisteret al., 1996; Nkrumahet al., 2006).This study aimed to evaluate the kinetic parameters of ruminal fermentation and methane production in vitro at different levels of substitution (0, 30, 40 and 50 g/g) of Brachiaria brizantha hay by tropical fruits (cocoa, cupuassu, soursop, genipapo and mangosteen).Material and MethodsFive tropical fruits were evaluated: cupuassu (Theobroma grandiflorum Schum, bean and pulp), soursop (Annona muricata, whole fruit), genipapo (Genipa americana, whole fruit), mangosteen (Garcinia mangostana, hulls) and cocoa (Theobroma cacao, hulls and beans).Fruits were processed and chemical composition determined according to AOAC (1990) for dry matter (DM), nitrogen compounds 217Tropical fruits such as mitigation potential of methane in ruminants(N), mineral matter (MM), ether extract (EE) and acid detergent fiber (ADF), according to Mertens (1992) for neutral detergent fiber (NDF); and to Licitra et al. (1996) for correction of NDF and ADF according to protein content (NDFp and ADFp), insoluble nitrogen in neutral detergent (INND) and in acid detergent (INAD). Analyses of CO2, CH4 and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were also carried out.To evaluate in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) and fermentation kinetics parameters, incubations were carried out using a semi-automated in vitro gas production technique, according to Mauricio et al. (1999).A completely randomized design (CRD) was used for each fruit tested in isolation. The data were analyzed by procedures of variance and regression analysis, evaluating levels of substitution of B. brizantha hay by tropical fruits at levels of 0, 30, 40 and 50 g/g. The procedures REG and PROC GLM PROC were used. A critical level of 0.05 of probability for error type I was adopted for this study.Results and ConclusionsIn vitro ruminal fermentation kineticsIt was observed that the substitution of Brachiaria brizantha hay for all tropical fruits used in this study had a linear negative effect (P<0.05) on latency time (LAT) as the level of substitution increased.Among the tropical fruits used in this study, genipapo resulted in in-creases (P<0.05) in the final volume of NFC (FVNFC) to a maximum of 134.2%, in the degradation rate of NFC (kdNFC) and in the final volume of FC (FVFC) which indicates a positive associated effect. As the final volume of FC (FVFC) was superior to FVNFCregarding the type of fruit used, this was considered the source with the most energy available to microbial populations in the rumen. . Cocoa beans and cupuassu also resulted in an increase (P<0.05) in the degradation rate of NFC (kdNFC). Soursop and mangosteen resulted in associated negative effects (P<0.05) as the hay was substituted by the fruits 218Tropical fruits such as mitigation potential of methane in ruminantsProducts of ruminal in vitro fermentationIVDMD  presented  similar  behavior  among  the  studied  fruits:  co-coa  hulls,  soursop  and mangosteen, which all affected it negatively (P<0.05). Cocoa beans and genipapo had similar behavior for IVDMD, gas volume, CO2  and A:P (acetate:propionate) ratio. IVDMD and A:P ratio presented quadratic behavior with maximum digestibilities  of 46.4 and  49.4%  atrespective  substitution levels of 23.1 and 27.1%.The estimated maximum A:P ratios were3.0 and 2.5at respective levels of 22.3 and 18.4%. Cupuassu and soursop presented quadratic beha-vior (P<0.05) for gas volume with maximum gas volume occurring at  levels of 28.5 and 30.5%, respectively.  Soursop also  presented quadratic behavior (P<0.05) for CO2 production, with maximum pro-duction at 30.7% of hay substitution by the fruit.The behavior of hay substitution by genipapo or soursop on SCFA production was similar. Quadratic behavior (P<0.05) was observed for acetic acid, butyric acid and A:P ratio; withlinear increasing beha-vior (P<0.05) observed for propionate production. The levels of substitution which most maximize these parameters were estimated to be between 27.4 and 27.9%, 23.6 and 24.0%, 18.4 and 19.6%, respectively. As observed for genipapo and soursop, mangosteen hulls also showed quadratic behavior (P<0.05) for acetic acid production.For the substitution of hay by the cupuassu and mangosteen fruits, a linear decrease (P<0.05)was observed for butyric acid produc-tion, while for cocoa beans a quadratic effect was observed with the minimal point of production occurring at a32.1% level of substitution. The substitution of hay by cocoa beans and cupuassu showed simi-lar quadratic behavior for A:P ratio with maximum points occurring at 22.3 and 22.8% respectively. For propionic acid concentration howe-ver, cocoa beans showed quadratic behavior with a minimal point at 20.4% while cupuassu showed increasing sigmoidal behavior.219Tropical fruits such as mitigation potential of methane in ruminantsEnteric Methane ProductionFor  methane  production,  the  substitution  of  hay  with  the  pro-cessed  fruits  cocoa  hulls, cupuassu, soursop and genipapo, resulted in an observed increase (P<0.05) in methane production. The substitu-tion of hay by mangosteen however promoted a reduction in methane production up to 31.5% hay substitution (Figure 1).ConclusionsCocoa  beans,  cupuassu  and  genipapo  improve  ruminal  fermen-tation  kinetics  and  can contribute to improve animal performan-ce.

Methane formation generates losses of 2 to 12% of consumed gross energy (Johnson and Johnson, 1995). Seve-ral strategies are being studied to mitigate this emission, and most have focused on the use of additives in the diet. The use of plants containing secondary compounds such as essential oils, tannins and/or saponins are natural alternatives to chemical additives that may be perceived negatively by consumers.Tannin-containing plants are under study for their anti methanogenic activity, which is attributed mainly to a group of condensed tannins (CT). The CT can act on the methanogenic bacteria and reduce metha-ne output (Martin et al., 2010).The Pampa biome has a well diversified flora, however, little kno-wn as its physical and chemical functions. This area contains chir-ca, which grows as a weed in fields. It\u2019s a native plant that has in its composition secondary compounds. However, there are no studies evaluating the use of this plant because cattle and sheep eat in small 222Chirca Leaves Minimizes Sheep Methane Emissionsquantities. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of increasing levels of Chirca leaves (Eupatorium buniifolium) on the individual intake and methane emission adult sheep.Material and MethodsThe experiment was conducted at Embrapa South Livestock (CPPSUL), Bag\u00e9, RS, in two evaluation periods: 09/15/2015 to 09/28/2015 and 10/05/2015 to 10/17/2015. Were used 20 adult sheep barrows, five animals per treatment, with an average initial weight was 43 \u00b1 7 kg. The basic diet for all treatments was composed of chopped alfalfa hay plus 300 grams of a commercial concentrate with 14% crude protein (CP). The amount of feed was calculated to allow 10% of leftovers daily. The treatments consisted of four levels of inclusion of chirca leaves (Eupatorium buniifolium; Asteraceae family). It is a shrub native of the Pampa biome. It was included at 0, 50, 100 and 150 grams. The chirca leaves were collected manually in the experimental fields of CPPSUL and subsequently dried in an oven with forced ventilation at 40\u00b0C. These were homogenized and milled and offered in different treatments. The feed supply was made in the morning and chirca leaves were mixed with the concentrate. Every day the leftovers were weighed for subsequent calculation of individual intake. The animals were kept in metabolic cages. The adjustment period was eight days followed by five days of collection.On the ninth day, the animals were prepared with equipment and materials for collection of enteric methane. To measure methane, we used the technique described by Johnson et al., (1994) and adapted by Gere and Gratton (2010) employing sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) trac-er. Stainless steel collection tubes were used for storage of gases, which was sampled for five consecutive days. We used control tubes (n=3) to control for ambient methane, and all samples were measured with gas chromatography.The leaves of chirca were analyzed for total phenolic content (TF) 223Chirca Leaves Minimizes Sheep Methane Emissionsand total tannins (TT) expressed as equivalent gram acid tannic.kg of dry matter-1 (DM) and condensed tannins (CT) expressed in equivalent gram of leucocyanidin.kg of DM-1.Daily individual intake and the emission of enteric methane.animals-1.day-1 for different periods were subjected to regression analysis by the statistical program JMP (JMP version 9.0.0, 2010). There was no signi-ficant interaction effect between the periods, and the data are presen-ted in relation to the treatment.Results and ConclusionsThere was no significant effect for the inclusion levels on the daily in-dividual intake (Figure 1). The literature found divergent results on the influence of condensed tannins on individual intake. This is due mainly to the tannin content in the diet (%) and the different forms of ruminal activities of tannins, which may reduce the digestibility of DM and nitrogen and affect fiber digestion (Batta et al., 2002). When these effects are small, there is no influence on individual intake.There was a linear significant effect decreasing for the inclusion levels on the reduction in the emission of enteric methane.animals-1.day-1. The performance of condensed tannins on the effect on mitigation of methane emissions, intake and digestibility of food is related to its composition\u2014especially with respect to molecular weight and degree of polymerization in addition to the quantity supplied. A similar result was found by Paengkoum et al. (2015) where it has been tes-ted the effect of five different inclusion levels of peel of the fruits of Garcinia mangostana. They found a linear and significant decrease in methane as a function of dose.224Chirca Leaves Minimizes Sheep Methane EmissionsFigure  1.

This production is naturally generated in the ruminal digestion of ingested food. The development of feeding strategies to minimize the emission of enteric CH4 is therefore desirable to mitigate, over time, emissions of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere and the economic benefits in the short term (Berndt and Tomkins, 2013). Currently, the use of foods with secondary compounds or other natural compounds to minimize methane are under study. Tannins may be found in the plant in soluble or insoluble form and can reduce enteric methane emissions when consumed in significant quantities (Saminathan et al., 2015).The objective was to evaluate the effect of increasing levels of pitangueira leaves on the individual intake and methane emission adult sheep.227Pitangueira Leaves Effects on Enteric Methane Emission in Adult SheepMaterial and MethodsThe experiment was conducted at Embrapa South Livestock (CPPSUL), Bag\u00e9, RS, in the period from 08/20/2015 to 09/02/2015. Were used 20 adult sheep barrows, five animals per treatment, with an average initial weight of 40 \u00b1 7 kg. The basic diet for all treatments was composed of chopped alfalfa hay plus 300 grams of a commercial concentrate with 14% crude protein (CP). The amount of feed was calculated to allow 10% of leftovers daily. The treatments consisted of four levels of inclusion of pitangueira leaves (Eugenia uniflora), which is a native fruit tree of the Pampa biome. It was included at 0, 50, 100 and 150 grams. The pitangueira leaves were collected manually in the experimental fields of CPPSUL and subsequently dried in an oven with forced ventilation at 40 \u00b0C, homogenized and milled to be offered in different treatments. Feed supply was made in the morning and pitangueira leaves were mixed with the concentrate. Every day the leftovers were weighed for subsequent calculation of individual intake. The animals were kept in metabolic cages. The adjustment period was eight days followed by five days of collection.On the ninth day, the animals were prepared for methane studies. To measure methane, we used the technique described by Johnson et al., (1994) and adapted by Gere and Gratton (2010) employing sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) tracer. It was used stainless steel tubes for storage of gases and remained the same for five consecutive days. We used control tubes (n=3) to control for ambient methane.

The literature found divergent results on the in-fluence of condensed tannins on individual intake. This is due main-ly to the tannin content in the diet (%) and the different forms of ruminal activities of tannins, which may reduce the digestibility of DM and nitrogen and affect fiber digestion (Batta et al., 2002).

V\u00e1zquez et al. (2016) tested the in vitro effect of including leaves of four different trees and three inclusion levels. There were no significant differences in the type of tree or level of inclusion.

In this sense, Saminathan et al. (2015) tested the effect of five different CT molecular weights purified from the Leuca-ena leucocephala and concluded that the fractions TC that had higher molecular weight and higher degree of polymerization showed greater reduction in methane production, but did not affect the digestibility of dry matter.Table 1.

The gas fermentation product was collected in aluminum bags with capacity of 5 L, which were subject to the flasks containing the effluent.Treatments and/or diets included: T0 = No inclusion (forage only kikuyo); T1 = Inclusion of 2% of the MS tannin; T2 = Inclusion 4% by weight of the MS, and T3 = Inclusion 6% of the MS tannins. The tannins come from leguminous tree Acacia mearsii (Weibull Black\u00ae), Tanac S.A. (Montenegro-Brazil), with a concentration of 79% of total tannins and 0.725 g of condensate/g MS tannins.Time evaluation consisted of 20 days, divided into two periods of 10 days each, where each diet or substrate was incubated at random two fermenters, obtaining four replications per diet.

E-mail address of presenting author*: laurazootec@hotmail.comIntroductionRuminant animals have a great advantage over simple-stomached animals, as their digestive process is able to release the energy con-tained in cellulosic material through carbohydrate fermentation by microorganisms enzymes from the rumen environment. However, carbohydrate fermentation results not only in short chain fatty acids (SCFA) but also in less desirable products such as heat, as well as methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) gases which represents energy loss for the animal estimated in 2 to 12% of gross energy from feed (Johnson and Johnson, 1995). As an adult ruminant can produce up to 17 liters of methane per hour and this gas cannot be metabolized even by rumen microorganisms, most of it is removed from rumen by expiration or eructation (Moss, 1993), and released in the environment.There are different techniques for methane emissions measurements by ruminants in production conditions; among them there is one that uses an inert gas tracer, sulphur hexafluoride (SF6). This technique results in a precise estimative of methane production by the animal, 236Effect of energy sources inclusion in diet on methane production of cattle determined by sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) tracer gas techniquebesides enabling the evaluation of animals in normal pasture condi-tions, it consists in placing a permeation tube, which releases SF6 at a previously known rate in the rumen, where by the contractions of this organ, CH4 and SF6 gases are released by eructation and samples are collected close to mouth and nostrils. This method assumes that the standard of SF6 emission simulates the standard of CH4 emission. The flow of CH4 released by the animal is calculated in relation to SF6 flow (Westberg et al., 1998).The objective with the present study was to evaluate energy sources inclusion in cattle diets on methane production determined by sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) tracer gas technique.Material and MethodsThe trial was conducted at the College of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science, University of S\u00e3o Paulo (USP), Brazil. Six Holstein nonpregnant and nonlactating cows (mean 730\u00b170 kg of BW) fitted with ruminal cannulas were randomly assigned to a replicated 3 x 3 Latin square (n= 18) in three isoenergetic (1.55 Mcal NE/kg of DM) and isoproteic (12% CP) experimental diets: control (CON): diet with low ether extract (3.5% of EE); soybean (SOY): diet with high ether extract (5.30% of EE) with 15% inclusion of whole soybean grain; citrus pulp (CiPu): diet with low ether extract (3.00% of EE) and high participation of pectin with 15% inclusion of citrus pulp. Diets were fed as total mixed rations with a ratio of concentrate to fora-ge of 50:50 (DM basis). Diets were offered twice daily at 0800 and 1600 h throughout the experiment for ad libitum consumption (mini-mum of 5 - 10% feed refusal). In all diets, the forage source was corn silage and the concentrate consisted of dry-ground corn grain, soybe-an meal, white salt, dicalcium phosphate, limestone and vitamin and mineral premix. Cows were housed in a barn equipped with indivi-dual feed bunks, rubbermatted floors, and automatic water fountains shared by 2 animals. Body weight was measured at the beginning of period 1 (d 1) and at the end of each of the 3 periods (d 21) at the same time each day. Each experimental period had 21 days, where 15 237Effect of energy sources inclusion in diet on methane production of cattle determined by sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) tracer gas techniquedays were destined for diet adaptation and the last 6 days for sam-pling collection. Dry matter intake (DMI) was daily evaluated at the last six days of each experimental period. Sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) tracer gas technique for methane measurement was described by Jo-hnson and Johnson (1995) and adapted in Brazil by Primavesi et al. (2004). After the adaptation of animals to the sampling apparatus (PVC canister), the measurement of methane production was per-formed over six days at 24 h intervals, after morning meal (08:00h). The concentrations of CH4 and SF6 were determined by gas chro-matograph in EMBRAPA Environment Laboratory Jaguari\u00fana/SP. The quantification of methane released by the animal in the sample was calculated in function of SF6 concentrations, associating the results to the known rate of the tracer gas in the rumen (Westberg et al., 1998). From the primary data was calculated potential emission of methane in g per day (CH4, g/d); kg of methane per year (CH4, kg/yr); g of methane per kg of DM ingested (CH4, g/kgDMI); % of Gross energy lost as methane (CH4, %GE) considering the % of gross energy of the diet;  Megacalories of methane produced per animal per day (CH4,Mcal/An.d), considering 13.16 kcal/g of CH4 and gross energy ingested per animal per day (GEI, Mcal/Ani.d). The data were submit-ted to variance analysis and the effects of treatment were separated by Tukey test (P <0.05 or P <0.10), using the Statistical Analysis System (Version 9.1, 2002-2003).ResultsThere was no difference (P > 0.05) between treatments for dry matter intake, when expressed in kilogram per day (kg/d), in rela-tion to body weight (%BW) or in relation to metabolic weight (g/kg BW0.75) (Table 1). This was probably, due to the fact that the animals were fed with isoenergetic and isoproteic diets in total mixed rations what may had provided better supply of nutrients along the day, favo-ring ruminal fermentation, especially the concentration of SCFA.238Effect of energy sources inclusion in diet on methane production of cattle determined by sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) tracer gas techniqueTable 1.

Average values of methane production was not affected (P > 0.05) by energy source inclusion in the diets when methane was expres-sed in gram of methane per day (CH4, g/d); kilogram of methane per year (CH4, kg/yr); gram of methane per kilogram of ingested dry matter (CH4, g/kg DMI); percentage of gross energy loss as methane (CH4, %GE) and megacalories per animal per day (CH4, Mcal/An.d), as well as the quantity of gross energy ingested per animal per day (GEI, Mcal/Ani.d) (Table 1). When evaluated at 10% probability, it was a significant effect of energy source for the average methane pro-duction in g/d; kg/yr and Mcal/An.d, resulting in increased methane emission for the treatment with citrus pulp compared to treatment with soybean and not differing from any of these variables for the control treatment.In the present experiment, there was no lipid source effect, proba-bly due to the lipid source used, as the shell of soybean does not provide oil directly to the ruminal microbiota, not presenting thus a toxic effect on microorganisms mainly on those who are involved in fiber digestion. On the other hand, the inclusion of a feed source rich in pectin, such as citrus pulp, generates higher CH4 production, as pectin favors acetate production despite of propionate or lactate (Van Soest, 1994), featuring a fermentative pattern similar to forages. According to ruminal fermentation stoichiometry, changes in ruminal fermentation profile that favor acetate production results in higher 239Effect of energy sources inclusion in diet on methane production of cattle determined by sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) tracer gas techniqueCH4 (Boadi et al., 2004). However, this fact was not observed in the present study.ConclusionsThe inclusion of a rich source of pectin such as citrus pulp or unsaturated fatty acids such  as  soybean  results  in  changes  in  the  rumen,  although  these  changes  are  of  small amplitude.ReferencesJOHNSON, K.

The purpose of this work was to study the effect of sup-plementation with solid soybean, canola and flaxseed, on a diet of Kikuyu grass (Cenchrus clandestinus) on the modulation of ruminal fermentation in vitro and methane emissions, using ruminal long term cultures.Material and MethodsRuminal  fermentation  system  in  vitro  semi-continuous  type  RUSITEC\u00ae  described  by Czerkawski and Breckenridge (1977) was used. Which was equipped with eight fermenters capacity of 700 ml, which in turn were adequated under controlled conditions to maintain microbial activity (39 \u00b0 C, anaerobiosis, and artificial sali-va - \u201cMcDougall Buffer\u201d continuous motion). At the beginning of the experimental period, in each fermenter 200 ml of artificial saliva was added, preheated to 39 \u00b0 C and also 500 ml of ruminal fluid extracted 242Effect of supplementation with oils of a forage diet, rumen fermentation and methane emissions in a system of artificial rumen - RUSITEC\u00aefrom four cows of the Holstein breed who were cannulated in rumen and fed kikuyu grass (Cenchrus clandestinus) all of this was filtered and mixed under a constant gassing of CO2 to temperature of 39 \u00b0 C.The procedures described by Giraldo et al, (2007) were followed in each fermenter and randomly, two bags with pore size of 100 \u00b5m were incubated, one contained 80 wet grams of ruminal digesta and 12 grams of substrate. After 24 hours of incubation, the bag with ru-minal digesta was removed and was replaced with a new containing the substrate, which was removed from each fermenter, upon completion of 48 hours of incubation and replaced by a bag substrate, a pro-cess that was conducted daily throughout the experimental period. The flow of each fermenter was kept constant by continuous infusion of Buffer pH 8.0 (McDougall, 1948) at a dilution rate of 4.49 \u00b1 0.13% / hour (647 \u00b1 18.40 ml/day). The effluent product from each fermenter was collected in bottles with a capacity of 1 L. The gas product of the fermentation was collected in aluminum bags with capacity of 5 L, which were attached to the flasks containing the effluent.Treatments and/or diets included: Control or basal diet: fodder ki-kuyo 35 days regrowth and a commercial concentrate, in a 70:30 ratio (D35C); supplementation of the basal diet with 50 g kg DM of the following oils: Soya (D35C-S); Canola (D35C-Ca) and Flaxseed (D35C-Li). The oils were solid and dry (ALSEC\u00ae), which facilitated its mixing with the incubated basal diet. Time evaluation consisted of 20 days, divided into two periods of 10 days each, where each diet or substrate was incubated at random in two fermenters, obtaining four replications per diet. Randomized complete block (RCB) design was used with repeated measures over time, the main effects are: experimental period (blocking factor) measurement day, treatment and treatment nested fermenter. When using the ANAVA a significant effect betwe-en treatments was detected, the comparison of means from a Tukey test with a significance level of 0.05 was made.243Effect of supplementation with oils of a forage diet, rumen fermentation and methane emissions in a system of artificial rumen - RUSITEC\u00aeResults and ConclusionsThe table 1 summarizes and samples the most outstanding results.

On the other hand, the core of sustainable agriculture is the ability to recycle materials and to use more efficiently nonrenewable and renewable resources including the provision of ecosystem services as biodiversity, carbon sink and water production (Power, 2010). The transition from business as usual to a more sustainable agriculture is closely adhered to the reesta-blishment of ecosystem services by integrated crop-livestock-forestry (Buller et al., 2015) and agroforestry systems to produce high-quality food (Buller, 2016). In this work, we show that the transition to more sustainable rural production can mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by agroecosystems without compromising revenues, parti-cularly in the Cerrado region.Material and MethodsGHG fluxes for sinks and sources were derived for enteric CH4 and 246Greenhouse gas emissions mitigation in more sustainable agroecosystems in Cerradoexcreta livestock N2O (Dong et al., 2006; World Bank, 2010), median soils CO2, CH4, and N2O fluxes in integrated agroecosystems (Buller et al., 2015), pasture CO2 fluxes and soil C fixation (Watanabe and Ortega, 2014), and C uptake of Cerrado forest (Meirelles and Henriques, 1992). Data are expressed in Mg CO2-eq/hectare/year according to GWP values (AR5-IPCC, 2013). Four levels of agricultural development were considered to a small farm with a productive area of 22.4 hectares: 1) agriculture with high technology in integrated swine-crop-pasture- eucalyptus system (ISCPE) in which about 10 heads/hectare is allowed in pasture-forestry fertigated with biodigester effluent (Buller et al. (2015); 2) ISCPE+10% SA (Sustainable Agroecosystems providing more diversified food as milk, fruits/nuts, honey, and ecosystem services, where native reforestation and nutrient recycling technologies are adopted as shown in Buller (2016); 3) ISCPE+30% SA; and 4) ISCPE+50% SA. The ISCPE considers only 5% area of native forest (Buller, 2016), whereas ISCPE+SA scenarios assume 10%, 30% and 50%, respectively, of  reforestation area to include the production of honey and fruits/nuts e.g. pequi (Caryocar brasiliense), gabiroba (Campomanesia sp), jatob\u00e1 (Hymenaea L.) and cumbar\u00fa (Dpterix alata). The changes in farm economy translated into sale returns, food energetics, net emissions and profitability, all expressed per hectare, are presented in Table 1, considering mature or well-developed agroecosystems ISCPE and ISCPE+SA.Results and ConclusionsFigure 1 shows the comparison of sinks and sources strength for ISCPE toward to a ISCPE+SA by adding native forest for natural food production. Nutrient recycling technologies and native forestry recovery in SA are responsible for reduced GHG emissions and for a favorable impact in the net emissions. The relative balance for each system indicate an increase in GHG emissions mitigation along the recovery of the native vegetation, and a decrease in net emissions 247Greenhouse gas emissions mitigation in more sustainable agroecosystems in Cerradowhile including more SA (Table 1). Gradual transition from ISCPE to ISCPE+SA 10% or 30% fits the commitment assumed at COP 21 by fixing the mitigation of GHG emissions respectively in 33 or 66%. Moreover, the native tree species are sources of new production outputs (fruits/nuts and honey) that, in a gradual timeframe related to the trees growth and life cycle maintain farmers\u2019 incomes and allow the participation in the very volatile commodities markets (Buller, 2016).Table 1 presents the calculations of sales, food energetics, net emis-sions and profitability per hectare for each agroecosystem under analysis. It is clear that the changes from ISCPE to ISCPE+SA do not change significantly farm sales and profitability. Moreover, including SA mitigates net C emissions and recovers vital ecosystem services at the farm level with the production of less energetic but healthier food.Figure 1.

Moreover, it is a non- invasive diagnosis technique to measure surface temperature that indicates thermoregulation physiological events as well as assesses the animal\u2019s thermal stress (BROWN-BRANDL et al., 2013).Adverse climate conditions directly impact thermal comfort and animal production. Therefore, this study aimed to verify whether infrared thermography can be used to identify animals experiencing thermal stress due to heat.251Infrared Thermography to Estimate Thermal Comfort in Meat SheepMaterial and MethodsThe research was carried out in the sheep farming sector of the Federal Institute of Par\u00e1 (IFPA) in the city of Castanhal, PA, Brazil. 18 crossbred (Dorper x Santa In\u00eas) sheep whose mean weight was 30\u00b12 kg were used. The animals were confined in a 6 m x 32 m barn oriented in the east-west axis featuring 3.0 m high ceiling and concrete columns 4 m apart that supported wooden trusses.  The barn was covered in fiber cement tiles.To the left of the barn, common bamboo (B. vulgaris Vittata) clumps were planted, which were used as a sanitary barrier and decreased the incidence of direct sunlight, thus creating a mild microclimate by the barn\u2019s left wall.The Hobo H8 Onset\u00ae data loggers were installed in the barn to monitor the environmental variables of air temperature (AT) and relative humidity (RH) every 15 min. The temperature and humidity index (THI) was determined according to the equation proposed by Thom (1959).An infrared camera (T650-FLIR\u00ae) set to emissivity coefficient of 0.95 was employed to measure the animals\u2019 surface temperature at different sites of the body. In all collections, the camera was placed at a standardized distance (4 m from the animal and 1.5m from the ground) to better focus and photograph the animals\u2019 right side (axilla, stifle, foreskin, eye, and lip) (Figure 1).             Figure 1: Thermal images highlighting the body sites analyzed.  A completely randomized spli-split-plot experimental design with six treatments and three repetitions was employed with environment (natural shade and no shade) as the plot and period of the day (5-6 AM, 1-2 PM, and 7-8 PM) in the split-plot. The periods were chosen from prior observations of the prevailing climate conditions so that one caused greater thermal discomfort than the others, thus leading to changes in behavioral patterns that could be detected. Analysis of variance was used for the statistical analysis of the variables and Tukey\u2019s test at 5% significance was used to compare the means.   Results and Conclusions During the experimental period, the values calculated were 24.04\u00b10.17, 29.26\u00b11.36 and 25.46\u00b10.16 for AT; 95.55\u00b10.87, 78.43\u00b14.73 and 90.92\u00b11.66 for RH; 74.84\u00b10.34, 81.40\u00b11.5 and 76.83\u00b10.23 for THI for the periods of 5-6 AM, 1-2 PM, and 7-8 PM, respectively.  The analysis of the temperatures in the periods shows that they were within the thermal comfort range, which is around 30 \u00b0C. However, RH values above the recommended were observed, between 40 and 70%, which indicates difficulties in exchanging heat with the surroundings (BA\u00caTA AND SOUSA, 1997). In the period between 5 and 6 AM, the animals were under comfort situation, however, the indices between 1 and 2 PM and between 8 and 9 PM indicated alert situation, suggesting thermal stress condition according to the THI (BA\u00caTA AND SOUSA, 1997). The analysis of variance showed no significant difference (P>0.05) for stifle, eye, and lip between the two environments. Temperature increased around the axilla of the animals in the environment with no shade since part of the process to maintain homeothermy occurs by increasing blood flow to the body surface through vasodilation (SILVA, 2000).  Thus, IT of the axilla and foreskin region enables identifying animals under thermal stress by heat. An effect (P<0.05) was observed for all periods, with the highest means observed between 1 and 2 PM (Table 1).

E-mail address of presen-ting author*: marcos.sarto28@gmail.comIntroductionCarbon sequestration (C) atmospheric and storage in the terrestrial biosphere, is one of the options that have been proposed to offset the emission of greenhouse gases, since the soil is the largest reservoir of C in terrestrial environments (Albrecht; Kandji, 2003). The determination of the proportion of the roots of species of photosynthetic pathways C3 and C4 has been performed by means of differences in natural isotopic concentrations of stable isotope 13C (Rosolem et al., 2012). The \u03b413C values of C3 plants typically range -30 to -22 \u2030  \u2030 (mean = -27 \u2030), while the C4 plants values range from -15 to -9 \u2030 (mean = -13 \u2030) (O\u2019Leary, 1988). It is then possible to calculate the proportion of carbon derived from C3 and C4 plants by mass mixture of equation (Balesdent & Mariotti, 1996; Yoneyama et al., 2001). The importance of agroforestry systems with respect to C  sequestration is being widely recognized, but there is still lack of quantitative data on the contribution of the root system of the species in the system. The inclusion of eucalyptus in areas of pasture can modify the amount and distribution of MOS intake in depth from the root system of the species. The objective of the study was to investigate the contribution of the eucalypt root system (C3) and Urochloa (C4) in integrated agricultural production.Material and MethodsEvaluations were performed in an experiment installed in the Advanced Technology Research Center of Agribusiness and Rubber Agroforestry 256Eucalyptus and Urochloa roots integration system Livestock-ForestSystems, the Agronomic Institute - IAC, located in Votuporanga, SP, Brazil.The experiment conducted in an area of degraded pasture, with ten years of implementation, the soil classified as Argisol according to Embrapa (2013). The treatments were two- eucalyptus hybrid Gran-cam 1277 and Urograndis H-13 and four sampling sites in the system: under the canopy of eucalyptus, 2.0 meters of eucalyptus line; 4.0 meters of eucalyptus line and 6.0 meters from the eucalyptus online integrated Urochloa brizantha cv. Marandu. Factorial 2 \u00d7 4 with a wit-ness, with three replications.The isotopic ratio of C was analyzed to determine the percentage of contribution of eucalyptus roots and Urochloa brizantha in the soil. The roots were ground in cryogenic, weighed and placed mill in tin capsules, then analyzed in a mass spectrometer of isotopic ratio (IRMS) Finnigan MAT Delta Plus.The results were analyzed using the statistical program Sisvar\u00ae (Fer-reira, 1999). When differences found, the means were compared by t-test (LSD) at 5% probability.Results and ConclusionsThe \u03b413C values of the roots of Urochloa (C4) and eucalyptus (C3) were -13.25 and -28.86 respectively. The root distribution Urochloa and eucalyptus was influenced by the distance of the eucalyptus line 0-0.05 m depth (Figure 1).The distribution of Eucalyptus roots is higher on the canopy, and decreases with increasing distance from the eucalyptus line at a depth of 0\u20130.05 m. The contribution of Urochloa roots is greater than in full sun integrated with Eucalyptus, with no significant difference in the integrated production system in the layer 0\u20130.05 m.257Eucalyptus and Urochloa roots integration system Livestock-ForestIn the integrated crop-Livestock system with eucalyptus and Urochloa, the amount of Eucalyptus roots (C3) is higher on the crown, and is reduced to as distances of the line.

Thus, integrated  production systems have received wider recognition not only for agricultural sustainability, but also for issues related to climate change on the planet (Albrecht & Kandji, 2003). Since agroforestry systems tend to sequester greater amounts of carbon than agricultural systems without trees (Neufeldt et al., 2009).The Livestock-Forest integration is a form of integrated agricultural production, which coexists in the same area trees, pastures and animals. However, knowledge of the behavior of species in competition for factors production becomes of great importance to the successful satisfactory productivity while avoiding the competition existing between species impede cultivation intercropping (Kluthcouski & Yokoyama, 2003). Furthermore, little is known about the effect of trees integrated with pastures. The objective of this study was  to investigate the growth of Urochloa in integrated with Eucalyptus.Material and MethodsEvaluations were performed in an experiment installed in the Advanced Technology Research Center of Agribusiness and Rubber Agroforestry Systems, the Agronomic Institute - IAC, located in Votuporanga, SP, Brazil.260Growth in Urochloa integrated with EucalyptusThe experiment conducted in an area of degraded pasture, with ten years of implementation, the soil classified as Argisol according to Embrapa (2013). The treatments were two- eucalyptus hybrid Gran-cam 1277 and Urograndis H-13 and four sampling sites in the system: under the canopy of eucalyptus, 2.0 meters of eucalyptus line; 4.0 meters of eucalyptus line and 6.0 meters from the eucalyptus online integrated Urochloa brizantha cv. Marandu. Factorial 2 \u00d7 4 with a witness, with three replications.Forage production was evaluated by cutting the forage within a square of 0.5 \u00d7 0.5 m (0.25 m2), launched at random from different points of the floor area of the plot, at the end (April) and early (Octo-ber) of the rainy season of 2015. After cutting, it was put in paper bags and weighed, obtaining the value of fresh matter. This material pulled out a subsample of approximately 500 g, which was dried in an oven at 60\u00b0C/72 hours thus obtaining the dry matter. The results were analyzed using the statistical program Sisvar\u00ae (Ferreira, 1999). When differences found, the means were compared by t-test (LSD) at 5% probability.Results and ConclusionsEucalyptus hybrids had similar effect on growth of forage. In the dry season of the year, there was no effect of the insertion of eucalyptus the pasture (Figure 1a). In the rainy season, forage production was higher than in full sun, and varied depending on the distance of eu-calyptus planting row (Figure 1b).Figure 1.

Fats, oils and greases have been mentio-ned as substrates that can increase the biogas production by 30% or more when added directly in an anaerobic digester (Hunter Long et al., 2012).Thus the addition of lipid residues to animal waste improves anaerobic digestion process, however there are few studies related to this topic.Lansing et al. (2010) evaluated the additions of 0; 2.5; 5.0 to 10% cooking waste oil in relation to the digesters volume capacity during co-digestion of pig manure and verified the benefits of the combina-tion of these residues, once the largest inclusion of oil doubled the biogas productions and the increment of methane in the biogas compo-sition in comparison to the lowest addition level.Nonetheless, high amounts of lipids in the substrates may have toxic effects on microorganisms, slowing the degradation process of the material in digestion. According to Mata-Alvarez et al. (2014) propor-263Co-digestion of swine manure and inclusion levels of waste vegetable oiltions of long chain fatty acids and polyphenols inhibit the degradation of the substrate in fermentation by the microorganisms and also have inhibitory action on certain microbial groups. Zhang et al. (2013) repor-ted that the process of toxicity is related to adsorption of long chain fatty acids (oleic and stearic acid) into the membrane of microbial cells hence reducing the transport of nutrients.Vallad\u00e3o et al. (2011) observed improvement on the production of me-thane (0.393 L CH4 / g COD reduced) from digesters supplied with effluent from poultry slaughtering and inclusion of lipolytic enzyme - lipase (1.0% volume).Thus, the usage of certain inclusion levels of lipase allowed the de-composition of compounds and enhanced the process of co-digestion; however, its excess can cause increased production of long chain fatty acids which are harmful to microorganisms, limiting the degradation process (Mata-Alvarez et al., 2014).Based on this assumptions, this work aimed to evaluate the perfor-mance of digesters supplied with pig manure and increasing levels of waste oil (8, 10 and 12% in relation to the contents of the TS in the substrate) in the presence of lipase enzyme (lipase) through the productions and potential productions of methane and as well as the reductions in the levels of total (TS) and volatile (VS) solids.Material and MethodsThe manure were collected by scraping the animal housing stalls and the  waste vegetable oil was obtained through a donation made by a commercial pastry, and already in disposal conditions (after successive frying re-uses). The experiment was carried out in 2014 in the city of Dourados, central-west region of Brazil, latitude 22\u00ba 13 \u201816 \u201cS and Longitude 54 48\u2019 20\u201d W. A completely randomized design was adopted in a factorial scheme 3x5, three inclusion levels of waste vegetable oil (in the proportions of 8, 10 and 12% in relation to the 264Co-digestion of swine manure and inclusion levels of waste vegetable oillevels of TS in the substrate) and five inclusion levels lipase (0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20 and 0.25% in relation to the levels of TS in the substrate) with two replicates (digesters). The manure used to feed the digesters had the following composition: 28.9% of TS, of which 78.3% were volatile. The inoculum contained 2.77% TS, with 67.4% volatile. Waste vegetable oil presented 98% TS.The batch digesters used in this study were built with two straight PVC cylinders with diameters of 150 and 100 mm and a container for storing the material to be fermented with 65mm in diameter. The digesters are also described as bench-scale batch digesters with an average capacity of 1.3 liters of substrate in fermentation in each one. The cylinders of 100 and 150 mm diameter are inserted into other so that the space between the outer wall of the inner cylinder and the inner wall of the outer cylinder could hold a volume of water (\u201cwater seal\u201d). The cylinder of 100 mm diameter had one end closed and one opening for the release of biogas and was kept submerged onto the water seal to provide anaerobic condition and store the gas produced.In the influent and effluent, concentrations of TS and VS were deter-mined through the methodology described by APHA (2005).The biogas volumes produced on a daily basis were determined by measuring the vertical displacement of gasometers and multiplying by their internal cross-sectional area. After each reading, the gasometers were zeroed using the records of biogas discharge.Specific productions of biogas were calculated by dividing the production values for the quantities of TS and VS added, and the results were expressed in liters of biogas per kg of each of the constituents evaluated. The composition of biogas was assessed using a gas analyzer, GA-21 Plus, Madur Electronics, equipped with sensors for determining CO, CO2 and CH4. The potentials of methane production were calculated by the production of methane, dividing the production values by the amount of TS and VS added in the digesters.265Co-digestion of swine manure and inclusion levels of waste vegetable oilThe results were subjected to analysis of variance considering as sources of variation the levels of oil and levels of lipase. Orthogonal contrasts were used to determine linear, quadratic and cubic effects of oil and lipase levels. These analyses were performed using the statistical computer package R (version 3.1.0 for Windows).Results and ConclusionsThe potential of methane production, which is the gas of greatest  interest  (Figure 3), was increased per amount of TS added and the inclusions of enzyme that showed the largest increase for the inclusion levels of 8, 10 and 12% waste oil were 0.13; 0.14 and 0.12% lipase, respectively. The most favorable inclusions of enzyme for VS were 0.12, 0.13 and 0.11% lipase for 8, 10 and 12% waste oil, respectively.A similar behavior between the two solid constituents was expected since VS is part of the TS, and they reflect even better the quality of digesters, once the integrant part of these constituents is the corresponding fraction degraded by microorganisms, generating biogas production and consequently methane. Thus, the highest production of methane (0.29 L per gram of VS added) might be achieved during co-digestion with addition of 0.11% lipase   and 12% waste oil, providing productions of methane 73% higher than with enzyme inclusion of 0.05% with the same level of oil.A decrease in the potential of methane production indicates a possible toxic effect of the long chain fatty acids that occurred with an average inclusion of lipase about 0.15%. According to Pastor et al. (2013), this behavior can be explained by the adsorption of long chain fatty acids in the microbial cell membrane, which will interfere with the mass transfer and consequently affect the methanogenesis.266Co-digestion of swine manure and inclusion levels of waste vegetable oilIn this way, it is concluded the inclusion of lipase at levels up to 0.14% (relative to levels of TS in the substrate) in the composition of substrates in co-digestion with oil at levels up to 12% (relative to levels of TS in the substrate), and swine manure improves the yields of methane.ReferencesAPHA.

However, a major concern with respect to this factor is related to the potential environmental impact the degradation of thousands of hectares of these pastures may have.Improvements in pasture management in the last decades have led to a great advance in animal production systems in the country. Among them are the adoption of cultivated pastures and the improvement of native pastures, leading to increased stocking rates and productivity (Oliveira et al., 2015).Besides the intensification of pasture management, producers must seek dairy cattle genotypes with better production characteristics. Therefore, there is growing interest in Holstein cross breeding to increase fertility and improve milk production and composition (Xue et al., 2011). Combining good genetics with sustainable grazing systems is essential to improve milk production and preserve the environment. This experiment was designed to examine the effect of different 269Intensive grazing system increases milk productivity of Holstein and Jersey-Holstein crossbred dairy cowsgrazing systems on the productivity of milk and its components by Holstein and Jersey-Holstein crossbred dairy cows.Material and MethodsTwelve Holstein and twelve Jersey-Holstein crossbred dairy cows were used in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement, represented by 2 cattle genotypes (Holstein and Jersey-Holstein) and 2 pasture systems (extensive with low stocking rate - EXT - and intensively managed and irrigated with high stocking rate - IIR). Cows were kept on pastures and received a dietary supplement (concentrate) formulated according to the NRC (2001) in the rate of 1 kg of concentrate per 3 kg of milk produced. The extensive pasture system was composed of two paddocks, 3.0 ha each, containing Brachiaria spp. and Cynodon nlemfuensis Vanderyst, managed as continuous grazing systems, without fertilization. The intensive managed system was irrigated and cultivated with Panicum maximum Jacq cv. Tanz\u00e2nia and overseeded    with  Avena byzantina cv. S\u00e3o Carlos and Loliun multifloram Lan. cv. BRS Ponteio, in autumn. The IIR system consisted of two similar 1.6 ha rotational systems, divided in 27 padocks with 600 m2 each, intermittently grazed, with a day of occupation and 26 days of rest. The intensive managed pastures were limed and fertilized with superphosphate and potassium chloride to achieve respectively, 20 mg P.dm-3 and 4% K in soil CTC - cation exchange capacity. Nitrogen was applied at the rate of 600 kg ha-1year-1.Three cows (tracers) of each genotype grazed simultaneously in each replicate of area. All grazing systems were submitted to stocking rate adjustments using the \u201cput and take\u201d technique (Mott and Lucas, 1952) and visual evaluation of forage availability.Milk yield (MY), 3.5% fat corrected milk (FCM), fat (F), protein (P), lactose (L), total solids (TS) and dry defatted extract (DDE), per area per year (kg ha-1year-1) were evaluated. Data were analyzed by the SAS\u00ae (SAS Institute, 2002) program, using Mixed Procedure.270Intensive grazing system increases milk productivity of Holstein and Jersey-Holstein crossbred dairy cowsResultsAnnual average stocking rates were 1.9 and 2.1 animals ha-1 in EXT and 6.6 and 7.9 animals ha-1in IIR, for Holstein and Jersey-Holstein breeds, respectively. Consequently, the type of grazing system in-fluenced (P<0.0001) productivity of milk and its components (Table 1). The IIR system increased the productivity of milk and its compo-nents, independently of the cow genotype used.Irrigation and intensive management caused an 258% increase in annual production of milk, when compared to the extensively managed system (63,867 vs.17,839 ha-1year-1). The cattle genotypes did not have any influence on productivity of milk and its components, estimated using the average production of each breed (Table 1).Forage production in irrigated rotational grazing systems tends to be high, and can increase stocking rate and productivity. However, gains in extensive systems, that present low carrying capacity, may be minimal despite the use of better cattle genotypes (Mendon\u00e7a et al., 2010). Avena byz ntina cv.

The state assumed a voluntary reduction in greenhouse gases emissions (GHG) of 20% by 2020 in relation to 2005 emissions. To reach this target, the CCP- MS appointed a number of strategies, including the State Program on Climate Change (PROCLIMA). The program will structure the basis to calculate and monitor the emission inventories of MS, and launch initiatives towards a low carbon emission economy.The current inventories are based on global and national standards and emission factors that are not completely adapted to particular characteristics of MS. Some emission factors are probably overestimating the net GHG emissions. Complementarily, the final balance of GHG do not consider some important mechanisms that absorbs carbon in conservative land use systems, e.g. no-tillage crop farming, improved sown pastures, zero-burning sugarcane plantations and integrated crop-livestock-forestry (ICLF) systems; as well as soil carbon and aboveground biomass through afforestation and ICLF.The objective of MS Carbon Neutral Project is to create the metho-dological basis for a low carbon economy in Mato Grosso do Sul, 273Greenhouse Gasses Emissions and land use in Mato Grosso do Sul (MS) State: an exploratory study to the MS Carbon Neutral Initiativedeveloping and adapting technologies for GHG emissions reduction and mitigation in the various sectors of the state economy, supporting the achievement of PROCLIMA\u00b4s goals.The first phase of the project was to understand the dynamics of GHG emissions based on available inventories and its relation to chan-ges in land use and agricultural activities in Mato Grosso do Sul State.Material and MethodsAs for GHG emissions attributed to Mato Grosso do Sul, we considered the estimates of the System Study Greenhouse Gas Emissions Estimates (SEEG), a system developed by the Climate Observatory (http://seeg.eco.br/). The estimates follow the guidelines of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). SEEG obtained the basic data from Brazilian Inventories of Anthropogenic Emissions and Removals of Greenhouse Gases, issued by the Brazilian Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MCTI), and from government reports, institutes, research centers, industry organizations and nongovernmental organizations. We analyzed land use changes in Mato Grosso do Sul based on the results of the SIGA-MS Program (SIGA-MS, 2016). Although data are available until 2016, we analyzed data from 2010 to 2014, since emission data are available only until 2014.Results and ConclusionsReported GHG estimates to Mato Grosso do Sul showed significant contribution from agriculture and land use change to the total emis-sions. From the total GHG in 2014 (55 Mt C- CO2e yr-1), 80% came from agriculture and land use change in this State. Energy was the second larger category, accounting for 16% of the GHG emissions (GGE) and showing the largest absolute (3.7 Mt C-CO2e yr-1) and rela-tive (72%) increases on emissions. The final balance of the agricultural sector (land use change + agriculture) was slightly negative, showing 274Greenhouse Gasses Emissions and land use in Mato Grosso do Sul (MS) State: an exploratory study to the MS Carbon Neutral Initiativea net GGE reduction of -0.1 Mt C-CO2e yr-1. We also verified that the major contribution for the observed net reduction was the enteric fermentation of cattle that showed an absolute decrease of -1.4 Mt C-CO2e yr-1.When we analyzed the changes in the agricultural sector in the same period (Table 2), we observed significant changes on land use from 2010 to 2014. There were net increases in areas of grain produc-tion (20%), planted forests (107%), sugarcane (52%), and native fo-rests (5%). At the same time, a proportional decrease in cattle grazing areas) indicates expansion of grain and sugarcane farming and com-mercial afforestation (mainly eucalyptus) over pasture areas, without displacing pristine or regenerating native land cover, which, as a Table 1.

Decrease in enteric methane emissions from cattle might be 275Greenhouse Gasses Emissions and land use in Mato Grosso do Sul (MS) State: an exploratory study to the MS Carbon Neutral Initiative strongly related to reductions in the total grazing area. From 2010 to 2014, state\u2019s total cattle herd decreased from 22.3 to about 21.0 million head (INFOAGRO, 2015). On the other hand, under the local conditions, land use change through expansion of grain crop farming, sugarcane and afforestation over grazing areas do not lead to increases in GHG emissions. These systems are probably increasing carbon stocks and sequestration in the systems and the net annual emission of 8.2 Mt C-CO2e yr-1 should probably be overestimated.  Another important point is that from 2010 to 2014, although pasture area and cattle herd decreased, beef production increased 21% (from 796,000 t to 965,000 t) (INFOAGRO, 2015). We calculated that the emissions per unit of beef yielded decreased from 29.4 to 22.8 kg C-CO2e kg-1 of beef. In other words, the same quantity of beef produced in 2014 emitted 22% less greenhouse gases than 2010.    Table 2.

We concluded that GHG emissions from Mato Grosso do Sul are mainly related to the agricultural sector, and especially to cattle enteric fermentation. Patterns of changes on emissions sources are compatible with changes in pasture area and cattle herd, but there are strong evidences that emissions due to land use change are overestimated. MS Carbon Neutral Initiative should focus on improving understanding of carbon balance on local agricultural systems developing site-specific emission factors that are more suitable for regional environmental conditions as well as for local production system\u2019s dynamics and peculiarities.

Aim of this work is to report the first case study of CNBB application for finishing steers and to present animal performance, beef quality, pasture characteristics, microclimate parameters and carbon balance estimates.Material and MethodsThe study was carried out at Boa Aguada Farm, Mutum Group, in Ribas do Rio Pardo, MS, Brazil. Local climate is Aw according to K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification, with average anual temperature of 24.1 \u00b0C and 1425 mm average annual rainfall. Site soil major characteristics were: 880\u00b144 g kg-1 sand, 11.5\u00b10.7 g dm-3 organic matter, 4.1\u00b10.1 pH (CaCl2),  and 17.5\u00b12.1% of soil basic saturation. Twenty-two Nellore steers, with 437\u00b17 kg initial live weight and 27\u00b11 months of age were finished in a silvopastoral system. The animals  were kept from December 2015 to May 2016 (154 d) in a paddock with 69.1 ha and 52.8 ha of grazing area. Grasses were Brachiaria brizantha cv. Piat\u00e3 (89%) and B. dictyoneura 278Carbon Neutral Brazilian Beef: testing its guidelines through a case study(11%) between tree alleys. Trees were eucalyptus clones, I-144 (Eucalyptus urophylla x E. grandis) and VM-01 (E. urophylla x E. camaldulensis), with spacing of 10 m between tree alleys and 3 m between alley rows and 2 m between trees in the row [(3 m \u00d7 2 m) \u00d7 10 m   arrangement], totaling 769 trees ha-1. Eucalyptus seedlings were planted in December 2010. During experimental period, cattle were fed with balanced dry feed supplement on pasture (dry matter intake of 0.5% of live  weight  daily). Animal  weight  was  monitored  every 50 days. Pasture was managed to be kept a minimum sward height of 30 cm and forage availability about 2,000 kg ha-1. The pasture was evaluated every 50 days, for height, ground cover, forage availability and nutritional value (crude protein, CP, neutral detergent fiber, NDF, and in vitro organic matter digestibility, IVOMD). Microclimate assessment (wind speed, temperature and relative humidity) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) were also carried out using a portable thermo-hydro-anemometer (Homis, model HMM-489) and a ceptometer (Accupar, model PAR-80), respectively, in 15 points under the silvopastoral system and in a reference area under full sun exposure from 9:00 am to 1:00 pm. The Temperature and Humidity Index (THI) was calculated as proposed by Thom (1959). Evaluations of tree total height, diameter at breast height (DBH) were performed at 60 months after planting. From the total height and DBH data, the volume of timber and carbon per plant was calculated and, from it, timber yield per hectare was estimated using the SIS Eucalipto software (Oliveira, 2011). The trunk\u2019s carbon content was converted in CO2 eq. using the 3.66 conversion factor. Individual enteric methane (CH4) emissions were calculated considering the index reported by Gomes et al. (2015) for silvopastoral systems (66 kg head-1 year-1), adjusted for the period of 154 d. Total CH4 emission was multiplied by 23 to calculate CO2 eq. emissions. At the end of the trial the steers were slaughtered at a commercial slaughterhouse (JBS) in Campo Grande, MS. Carcasses were evaluated for hot carcass weight, backfat score (1 to 5) and maturity (teeth). After 24-h chilling, carcasses were sectioned at the 12th-13th ribs region to  expose Longissimus muscle, where backfat thickness and ribeye 279Carbon Neutral Brazilian Beef: testing its guidelines through a case studyarea were measured. Longissimus muscle samples were taken to the laboratory to evaluate marbling, color, pH, cooking losses and Warner-Bratzler shear force. The carcass weight gain during the experimental period was calculated as the difference between the initial and the final carcass weight. Initial carcass weight was estimated multiplying initial live weight by 0.5, considering 50% as the initial carcass backfat.Results and ConclusionsIt was observed that the PAR strongly decreased from the December (summer) to May (autumn) in the silvopastoral system. However, forage availability was maintained within the limits expected for the grass species (Table 1). Stocking rate ranged from 0.4 to 0.5 AU ha-1. In March, the forage had levels of 8.7\u00b11.5% CP, 71.5\u00b12.1% NDF and 51.7\u00b12.9% IVOMD. Regarding microclimate variables, silvopastoral system presents better THI when   compared to full sun areas. In December, THI under full sun was at emergency level (84) of its scale and danger (83) in shaded areas. In May, improvement of microclimatic conditions under shaded areas was more significant, changing from danger (80) under full sun to critical (77) in shaded areas.

Whereas carbon fixed in lumber, was estimated to reach 59 ton CO2 eq. ha-1 or 5.35 ton CO2 eq. ha-1 year-1 after 11 years of grazing. Therefore, it should be possible to neutralize the total GHG emissions from cattle kept in the system with a carbon surplus of 4.72 ton CO2 eq. ha-1 year-1 from this system. Silvopastoral and agrosilvopastoral systems in Brazil are able to ensure beef quality and animal welfare with production diversity, profitability and environmental benefits like GHG emissions mitigation. Systems with lower tree density can also increase beef production (Oliveira et al., 2014), but with lower carbon balances. The CNBB guidelines should be suitable for certificating cleaner beef production under more sustainable systems. However, it will be necessary public and private engagement to set commercial arrangements that profit from these guidelines.  References ALVES, F. V.; ALMEIDA, R. G.; LAURA, V. A. 2015.

On the other hand, enteric metha-ne from livestock is responsible for 20% of total greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions in the country (MCTI, 2014). The adoption of posi-tive carbon balance technologies in agriculture is a key factor to Brazil succeed in public policy to reduce its carbon footprint. Thus, estima-tes on carbon sources and sinks are important to support the adoption of integrated production systems as a GHG mitigation strategy. The objective of this study was to estimate the impact of the adoption of integrated crop-livestock and crop- livestock-forest systems on the mitigation of enteric methane emissions from pasture based beef cattle in Cerrado region.Material and MethodsThree beef cattle production systems were compared, in a year base, in terms of enteric methane emission and carbon sequestration: a) ICL \u2013 integrated crop-livestock system; b) ICLF - integrated crop-livestock-fo-283Neutralization of enteric methane emissions by carbon sequestration under integrated crop-livestock and crop-livestock-forest systems in Cerrado region.rest system with doube lines of Eucalyptus urograndis trees and spa-cing between rows of 22m (417 trees.ha-1) and c) LPP \u2013 low produc-tive pasture. The stocking rates on Brachiaria sp. pastures were 3.0, 1.7 and 1 head per hectare, respectively. Beef cattle enteric methane emissions (ECH4) were based on Mandarino et al (2015) and data from Cerrado soil carbon sequestration for ICL and LPP came from a long--term experiment (24 years) according to Jantalia et al. (2006) and Sant\u2019anna et al. (2015). Findings from Pulronik et al. (2015) supported the value of soil carbon sequestration in ICLF 24.5% lower than ICL. Regarding to the annual carbon trunk fixation rate, we estimated the accumulated mass of each tree being 0.0306 (density of 0.51 x volu-me of 0.06 m3) considering 46% of carbon content. All these studies were carried out in the central plateau of the Cerrado region at Embrapa Cerrados research Center, Brazil (15\u00b036\u201941.51\u201dS 47\u00b042\u201908.92\u201dO), on Brachiaria sp. pastures under Oxisols.Results and ConclusionsThe highest pasture carrying capacity and stocking rates resulted in the highest enteric methane emissions for ICL and ICLF when compared to LPP (Table 1.). Nevertheless, the soil carbon sequestration in ICL and the additional carbon sequestration by the trunk carbon fixation in ICLF systems can mitigate 100% of all ECH4 emitted. Moreover, ICL and ICLF presented a positive annual carbon balance of 1.3 and 23.0 Mg CO2eq.ha-1, respectively. The opposite occurred with LPP, which presented a negative carbon balance of 0.4 Mg CO2eq.ha-1.

These results support the statements that integrated systems in fact can contribute as a mitigating strategy of greenhouse gases. Besides that, it can be highlighted the necessity to recover pasture yields as an opportunity to reduce the environmental impact of livestock systems. It can be concluded that the adoption of integrated crop-livestock or crop-livestock-forest systems can mitigate the ECH4 from pasture based beef cattle in Cerrado region.ReferencesJANTALIA, C.

Beef cattle production worldwide has increased almost 40% in the last three decades , Americas being one of the regions which led this development (FAO, 2013). At the same time, the need to reduce the sector\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions and its overall environmental footprint has become  a  top  priority for  industry  and policy  makers  (Gerber  et  al.,  2013).  Therefore, the objective  of  this  research  was  to  assess  beef  cattle  productivity in  grazing systems  with different levels of intensification.Material and MethodsThe grazing experiment was conducted from march 2012 to au-gust 2013 with 24 Nelore steers (292.8 \u00b1 1.28 kg of live weight - LW;15 months old). Animals were allotted to four grazing systems with two area replications (blocks), at an experimental station of the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (EMBRAPA), South-east of Brazil 1) DP: degraded pasture (1.1 animal units - AU/ha; Brachiaria decumbens ); 2) IHS: irrigated pasture with high stocking 287Beef cattle productivity in grazing systems with different levels of   intensificationrate (5.9 AU/ha; Panicum maximum); 3) DHS: dryland pasture with high stocking rate (4.9 AU/ha; Panicum maximum), 4) DMS: dryland pasture with moderate stocking rate (3.4 AU/ha; Brachiaria brizantha),. Pasture in IHS DHS and DMS systems were fertilized  with  600,  400 and  200  kg  N  year-1,  respectively.  The irragated pastures  were overseeded with Avena byzantina cv. S\u00e3o Carlos (60kg/ha) and Loliun multifloram Lan. cv. BRS Ponteio (30 kg/ha), in 06/01/2012 and 04/22/2013. With exception of the  degrade pasture, all pastu-res were manage in a rotational grazing system. Three steers were used to evaluate performance in each system (testers) and regulating animals were used to adjust the stocking rate using the \u201cput and take\u201d technique (Mott and Lucas, 1952) and visual evaluation of fora-ge availability. . Animals were slaughtered with approximately 450 kg of LW. Data were analyzed as completely randomized block design using PROC   MIXED.Results and ConclusionsAs expected, IHS system presented higher socking rate (6.9 AU/ha) and higher animal productivity (Table 1) due to higher amount of N applied, irrigation and the overseeding with winter grasses, resulting in higher availability of forage in the pasture. Systems DHS and DMS presented similar and intermediary stocking rates and productivi-ty. The  DP  system resulte  in  the  lower  stocking  rate  and  produc-tivity  when  compared  to  all  others.  Overall, animal   productivity  increased as  the  intensification  of  the  systems  increased.     Simi-larly, Barcellos  et  al.  (1999)   verified lower  carcass  yield  (51  kg/ha/year)  for  animals    grazing degraded pasture when compared  to those kept in pasture under recovery (310.5  kg/ha/year).Besides the very low productivity observed in the degraded pasture, there is  a strong relation between GHG emissions by plants and soil, especially CO2, and the  degradation process of pastures (Oliveira, 2015). According to Primavesi (2007), degradation of farmland cau-ses  soil  compaction,  reducing  aeration  and  water  infiltration,  with  higher potential  for GHG emission; the exposed soil allows greater thermal amplitude which accelerates the degradation process.288Beef cattle productivity in grazing systems with different levels of   intensificationTable 1.

Being homeothermic, buffaloes subjected to high temperatures and relative air humidity may experience thermal stress (MORAES J\u00daNIOR et al., 2010), which is able to set off physiological processes. The ability to monitor and identify animals experiencing thermal stress becomes important since these initial analyses are able to define beforehand the best management for the herd. When it comes to physiological variables, data collection must be as reliable as possible, however, not always are the data properly collected. That entails the need to develop more precise methods to analyze animal response to environmental conditions.The use of infrared thermography is quite broad and the technique may be employed in the animal production system as a non-invasive 291Infrared Thermography in the Assessment of Thermal Comfort of Confined Water Buffaloes in the Amazon Biomemethod to replace traditional ones (SCHAEEFER et al., 2012) in order to measure skin temperature without interfering in the animal\u2019s behavioral reactions.This study aimed to assess thermal responses in water buffaloes using infrared thermography associated with environmental variables and thermal comfort indices.Material and MethodsThe trial was carried out at the animal research unit \u201cSenador \u00c1lvaro Adolfo,\u201d belonging to Embrapa Eastern Amazon, in the city of Bel\u00e9m-PA, Brazil. The study area features Af2 climate (MARTORANO et al., 1993) with mean rainfall above 60 mm in the least rainy month and annual rainfall around 2,900 mm. The data were collected in a field trial on 24 crossbred Murrah and Mediterranean female buffaloes whose initial age and mean weight were 34 months and 514\u00b169.88 kg, respectively. The animals belong to Embrapa Eastern Amazon\u2019s experimental herd and the procedures were approved by the Committee of Animal Ethics (protocol n\u00ba 007/2015). The measurements were performed in November 2015 while the animals were managed in tie-stall facilities featuring individual feed and drinking troughs.The thermographic images were captured 1.5 m away from the animals three times a day (4 AM, 2 PM, and 8 PM) and framed the cranial and tail sections. The left ileum (A), left ischium (B), right ischium (B1), right ileum (A1), sacrum (C), nose (D), upper lip (E), eyeball (F), thigh (G), forehead (H), and region around the tail (I) were tagged in the images (Figure 1 and 2). The infrared camera used (T650-FLIR\u00ae) set to emissivity coefficient 0.95 emissivity was employed to measure the animals\u2019 surface temperature at different sites of the body.292Infrared Thermography in the Assessment of Thermal Comfort of Confined Water Buffaloes in the Amazon BiomeThree data loggers (U12-HOBO\u00ae) were used to characterize the agrometeorological conditions inside the barn regarding temperature and relative air humidity. The data loggers were installed in agrometeorological cases at the height of the animals\u2019 muzzle along the stalls hallway. The data were recorded every 15 min and were downloaded only at the end of the experimental period. The temperature and humidity index (THI) inside the barn was calculated every 15 min and four values were obtained per period of the day assessed based on the model proposed by Thom (1959) according to the following equation: THI = [(0.8 AT) + (RH/100) x (AT-14.4) 46.4], where AT is air temperature (\u00b0C) and RH is relative humidity (%).Results and ConclusionsThe mean THI values were 76.5, 84.0, and 80.0, at 4 AM, 2 PM, and 8 PM, respectively. The values observed at 4 AM and 8 PM were be-low those proposed by Somparn et al. (2004), who stated the animals were under risk at THI \u2265 84, i.e., the animals experienced thermal discomfort at 2 PM.Buffaloes have a less efficient evaporative thermoregulation system than  bovines given their limited sweating capacity, which makes Figure 1. Cranial thermal image with the respective collection sites.Figure 2.

One way of dissipating heat is by redirecting blood flow to the body surface, thus increasing skin temperature, which facilitates heat dissipation through non-evapo-rative mechanisms. It was observed that, as air temperature increa-ses, the animals\u2019 body surface temperature also increases, leading to a significant correlation between AT and most anatomical sites, parti-cularly between the forehead and AT (0.94) and THI (0.94) (p<0.01) (Table 1).

Pantanal rangelands include different habitats, which presenting a temporal and spatial variation in productivity and processes, according flooding gradient. The main grazing areas are wetland and open grassland on which cattle select grazing sites with better quality forage. In general, total average dry matter of theses areas is low with low animal carrying capacity. Thus, ranchers have been substituting natural pasture of lower quality of the higher areas by exotic pasture cultivation (mixed pasture), increasing the carrying capacity of the management units (Santos et al., 2011). This work aimed to assess the forage mass accumulation in the main grazing sites in two pastures systems to identify resting decisions to maximize the carbon flow in the system.Material and MethodsThe study was carried out at Nhumirim ranch, Pantanal Nhecol\u00e2ndia sub-region in two management units (MU): 1 - mixed pastures (natural + cultivated) and 2- disturbed natural pastures. In each MU two main feeding sites were identified. In both of them seven exclusion from grazing cages (1m2) were allocated in order to 296Managing Pantanal rangelands for optimizing carbon flow: effects of growing season and pasture type on dry mass accumulationestimate forage and no forage mass accumulation rate, according to triple pairing methodology from September 2014 to March 2015. Aboveground plants were clipped in 0.25m2 plots inside and outside of the exclusion cage in October 2014 (late dry season), December (early rainy season) and March 2015 (late rainy season). The dry mass accumulation (kg DM.ha-1) was obtained by the difference between the forage mass from inside the cage and from the outside of the cage. All plant were separated into fodder and non-fodder species.Results and ConclusionsThe values of dry mass accumulation were higher in mixed pasture during the early season and were negative in the late rainy season (Figure 1), indicating high grazing pressure on these feeding sites. De-cember was the more productive month because November was a rainy month. These results suggest that fencing the pastures in the months of the early rainy season (October to November) in function of the rain-fall distribution could be a strategic management practice to maximize the carbon flow in the system and the forage accumulation.Figure 1.

It also observes that the dry matter accumula-tion rate was reduced during late rainy season, as consequence of pasture cleaning. It notes that fenced patches of disturbed natural pasture presented higher proportion of non-fodder species. Thus, defer-red grazing can be used during strategic season but more investiga-tion are necessary to define the adequate length of the deferment. The cultivation of exotic forage species in open grassland can reduce the proportion of non-fodder species and invasive natural species. However, due to spatial and temporal variation of natural pastures, adaptive management strategies are necessary to mitigate and redu-ce greenhouse gas emissions and optimizing carbon flow.ReferencesSANTOS, S.A., DESBIEZ, A., CRISPIM, S.M.A., COMASTRI FILHO, J.A., ABREU, U.G.P. & RODELA, L.G.

However, the biggest problem Cerrado remains being the degradation, which affects more than half of the pasture areas. Thus, the implementation of new production systems as the consortium of grasses  and legumes or the combined crop-livestock system has been appointed as alternatives to this problem.An important aspect in systems of consortia between crops and forages is that these show slow accumulation of dry matter in the early stage and therefore compete less with annual crops, and studies on the use of woody legumes intercropped with maize are infrequent. However, the alternative is considered feasible in view of the potential of these plants in fixing atmospheric nitrogen through Rhizobium bacteria and association with mycorrhizal fungi, which are able to increase the absorption area of nutrients and water by plants.Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the use of legumes in association with Panicum maximum cv. Massai, deployed with the maize crop through the maize yield and herbage accumulation.300Production of maize and biomass of massai grass in the establishment of a consortium with forage legumesMaterial and MethodsThe experiment was carried out at the Research Center of the Agency for Agricultural Development and Rural Extension in Campo Grande, MS. The experiment was conducted in split plot in time, having allocated the plots and subplots the cutting times in a randomized complete block design with four replications.Five woody legumes were evaluated: Albizia lebbeck, Cratylia argentea, Dipteryx alatta, Leucaena hybrid and Leucaena leucocephala cv. Cunningham and a herbaceous (Arachis pintoi cv Belmonte) in consortium with Panicum maximum cv. Massai and maize, and maize monoculture, cv. Massai in monoculture and intercropping maize with cv. Massai. The soil of the experimental area is classified as Oxisol textural class of sandy-clay.The woody legumes were sown before the grasses on December 5, 2007. A line of woody legume was seeded at every three maize lines, so that the spacing of these was 3.0 m. The mechanized sowing of maize (BRS 2020) in monoculture occurred on December 14, 2007, at a spacing of 0.75 m.The maize grain yield (kg ha-1) was evaluated in 4 m of six axis of each plot. In threshing of corn cobs to tread grain, straw cobs and cobs were separated and weighed. Withdrew two subsamples of 500 g of each material for estimates of dry biomass of straw and cob. The stubble was evaluated in the same area harvested for determination of maize yield, weighted in the field, and soon after two subsamples of 1.0 kg each were taken and also pre- dried to estimate the stubble dry biomass.301Production of maize and biomass of massai grass in the establishment of a consortium with forage legumesAfter the harvest of maize cobs the height of woody legumes were measured, measuring five plants at random per plot at the center line with a ruler graduated in millimeters, the height from the ground to the curvature of the leaf blade. The evaluation of the accumulation of dry biomass of massai grass occurred with plant height of 45 cm, leaving a residue of 10 cm.The two samples of material obtained from each plot were homogenized and separated into two subsamples of 0.5 kg each. One of the subsamples was made by weighing the material in nature, and after that weighting its again for the estimave of the dry biomass accumulation. In another subsample the forage species were separated in the case of samples grass and herbaceous legume and in the massai grass morphological components were separated. These subsamples were also processed to estimate the contribution of each morphological component in total biomass. The consortia were also analyzed in order to compare the accumulation of total biomass between the experimental arrangements.The dependent variables were subjected to variance analysis in split plots in time and the means compared by the Soctt-Knott test at 5% probability, using the application SAEG (Ribeiro Junior, 2001).Results and ConclusionsThe maize grain yield obtained with consortia (grass and / or legumes) was 32% lower than that obtained with the maize monocrop. Cobucci et al. (2007) found that the recovery of nitrogen intercropped with maize was the best alternative with the restriction that the productivity of maize grain is around 3600 kg ha-1, this production lower than that achieved in this work, which average was 5193 kg ha-1.All consortia studied interfered negatively in grain yield compared to maize monocrop. However, according to the National Supply Company (Conab), the average Brazilian maize crop for 2010 was 302Production of maize and biomass of massai grass in the establishment of a consortium with forage legumes4412 kg ha-1, this productivity lower than that obtained in this study. Severino et al. (2005) also observed reductions in corn yield of 7130 kg ha-1 in monocrop to 4000 kg ha-1  in consortium with P.maximum cv. Coloni\u00e3o, U. decumbens and U. brizantha.Several studies conducted with intercropping maize and forage show that on the average, the presence of reduced forage productivity of grain in 5% (Cobucci et al., 2007; Severino et al. 2005), and this reduction lower than that found in this study (32%). However, the different findings may be related to a combination of several factors such as  the population of the forage, the time of its deployment, the planting arrangements, the presence of weeds, pests and predators, the application or not of herbicides, fertility of soil and water conditions.The dry biomass of green accumulation massai grass monocrop was higher by 41.8% and 74.6% respectively to that observed in consortium with arachis and with the woody legumes, as did not suffer competition with maize and, also received nitrogen fertilization. Therefore, the consortium with maize harmed more the cv. Massai than otherwise, indicating that the maize is more competitive compared to grass.For the evaluation of the arrangements, after the harvest of maize, the results represent the sum of two cuts for accumulation of dry biomass of green massai grass, and only one cut for legumes (Table 1). The highest concentrations of DBG occurred during the wet season after the maize harvests were observed in massai grass monocrop and in consortia with albizia and baru woody legumes.There was not great participation in this legume establishment phase, when compared to the accumulation of the massai grass. The only woody legumes that had already cutting height303Production of maize and biomass of massai grass in the establishment of a consortium with forage legumesduring the harvest season of the maize, were Leucaena cv. Cuningham and Leucaena hybrid, the others were only assessed in the period after the maize harvest.Table 1.

The woody legumes, Leucaena cv. Cuningham and Leucaena hybrid continued to show better development and the higher accumulation of biomass, even after having been cut at the maize harvest period. However, no significant difference in relation to the Albizia which showed the accumulation similar to the leucenas on its first cut. The low development of woody legumes is an indication that the line of maize was sown very close to the line of these plants. With this, a strong competition was developed of the maize on the woody legumes, probably at the level of the root system and light. The cratilia has a very slow development, which resulted in a low biomass accumulation in the first assessment after the corn harvest, with lower productivity than other woody legumes. The woody legume intercropping baru was not evaluated in relation to the accumulation of DM, because it did not a show good growth in this intercropping system, which can be observed by the height of the plant 160 days after sowing.  In consortium of massai grass + arachis there is the need for more studies regarding the introduction of these forages with less spacing, where the grass could have an increased production capacity and it would not affect the development of the herbaceous legume, for this exhibits a greater resistance to shading. The grain yield of maize and total dry biomass accumulation in the consortia are considered satisfactory. The maize and massai grass consortia with woody legumes, Leucaena cv. Cuningham, Leucaena hybrid and Albizia, are considered viable and recommended for implementation of agroforestry systems.  References  RIBEIRO J\u00daNIOR, J.I.

Studies indicate that the utilization of expanded corn increases the rates of ruminal fer-mentation and degradation, which can also modify ruminal conditions of pH, fiber fermentation and the ruminal production of methane. On the other hand, crude glycerin has been broadly utilized as a cereal substitute on diets for ruminants (Van Cleef et al., 2015). In vitro stu-dies shows a mitigation effect from the crude glycerin on methane pro-duction (Lee et al., 2011). The evaluation of methane emission through respiration chambers is considered the \u201cgold standard\u201d method, which allows the precise quantification of gas production (breathing, eruc-tation, rectal emission) and animal consumption, making possible the conjoint evaluation of the energetic metabolism. The objective this paper was to measure the effect of corn processing method and use of crude glycerin on enteric methane production of sheep.Material and MethodsThe experiment was carried out at the Animal Metabolism and Calori-metry Laboratory \u2013 (LAMACA) from the School of Veterinary Medi-cine, Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG), in Belo Horizonte, 306Effects of corn processing method and use of crude glycerin on methane production in sheepMG, Brazil. The treatments were different at the corn processing me-thod and the presence or absence of crude glycerin: 1) ground corn; 2) ground corn + crude glycerin; 3) expanded corn and 4) expanded corn + crude glycerin. The  crude glycerin replaces corn by 10% in natural matter basis, corresponding to inclusion of 5% diet (DM basis). The utilized crude glycerin was provided by ADM Biodiesel Ltda (Archer Daniels Midland Company) (Rondon\u00f3polis, MT), and contained 83% glycerol, 2% water, 5% NaCl and 0.003% methanol and was obtai-ned from soybean oil. Glycerin was mix with the other ingredients during the production of the concentrate. The diets were formulated with a roughage:concentrate ration of 50:50 as DM basis, using corn silage as a source of roughage. Eight Santa In\u00eas ewes, no pregnant, averaging 54,5 kg of body weight were randomly assigned according to a 4x4 Latin square design, in a factorial 2x2 (two types of corn processing with or without crude glycerin). Statistical analyses were performed using the PROC GLM of SAS. Orthogonal contrasts were performed to evaluate simple and compound effects. The methane measuring was done along 24h at the open-circuit indirect calorimetry system to ovine, which were previously adapted the experimental diets for 18 days and submitted to a trail of intake and apparent digestibili-ty through 7 days in each experimental period. The animal procedures were approved by the Ethical Committee of Animal Use from Universi-ty Federal of Minas Gerais (CETEA/UFMG, protocol #071/10).Results and ConclusionsThe contrast on the effect of corn processing indicate no signifi-cant differences (P<0.05) between treatments with ground corn and expanded corn on methane production (Table 1).However, Hales et al. (2012) observed that the intensified corn proces-sing (steam-flaked corn or dry-rolled corn) reduced methane produc-tion in cows (2.47 vs 3.04 % GE) due a ruminal pH reduction.

Besides, minor methane produc-tion in expanded corn without crude glycerin may have occurred due a bigger flotation on pH values, associated to a fast fermentation of the expanded starch (Hales et al., 2012). Therefore, an interaction is observed between corn processing and the crude glycerin inclusion up to 5% of diet DM.Table 1.

In the last few years, local agricultural development has been influenced by other agro-industries, mainly sugar cane and eucalyptus forestry, expanding over grazing areas, causing herd displacements but also leading to changes on local production systems. Herd numbers show a tendency to decrease, while beef production keeps stable. This means improvements on individual husbandry techniques as well as a general re-arrangement of herd structure. This can have important consequences on greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions from the sector in the area. In this context, the goal of this study was to explore the im-plications of changes on cattle herd size and structure as well as land use change on GHG emissions per unit beef produced per unit of area used for cattle grazing in Mato Grosso do Sul State.Material and MethodsCattle herd data for the years 2010 and 2013 were obtained from the Animal Health Agency of Mato Grosso do Sul (IAGRO). The database includes all foot-and-mouth disease vaccination registers for 311Changes in cattle herd composition and its implications on greenhouse gases emissions in Mato Grosso do Sul State between 2010 and 2014all 79 local municipalities of the State, recording numbers of animals vaccinated, according to sex and age range in months (0 to 12; 12 to 24; 24 to 36 and over 36 months of age). This database also pro-vides information on transit of cattle for slaughter within and outside the State, which was used to estimate emissions per slaughtered head produced in Mato Grosso do Sul. There were other sources of information regarding slaughter numbers, as from the \u201cSistema de Infor-ma\u00e7\u00f5es Gerenciais dos SIF (SIG-SIF)\u201d from the \u201cMinist\u00e9rio da Agricul-tura Pecu\u00e1ria e Abastecimento\u201d and, also, from the \u201cSistema IBGE de Recupera\u00e7\u00e3o Autom\u00e1tica (SIDRA)\u201d available from the internet portal of the \u201cInstituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estat\u00edstica (IBGE)\u201d. Their numbers are close to those from IAGRO, however they do not consider animals sent for slaughter in other States as well animals brought in from somewhere else.Data related to Land Use Change (LUC) were kindly made available by the \u201cAssocia\u00e7\u00e3o dos Produtores de Soja e Milho de Mato Grosso do Sul (APROSOJA/MS)\u201d, from the database of their \u201cSistema de Infor-ma\u00e7\u00f5es Geogr\u00e1ficas do Agroneg\u00f3cio de Mato Grosso do Sul (SIGA/MS)\u201d which, twice a year, carries out a detailed survey on land use in Mato Grosso  do  Sul,  using  remote  sensing  techniques  (satellite  imagery),  validated  by a comprehensive ground truthing.Methane emission rates from enteric fermentation for each specific age range i.e. category under local conditions are not available in the litera-ture. The most suitable data found for the scope of the study was from Demarchi et al (2003a) and Demarchi et al (2003b). The authors found CH4 emission factors for different cattle weight categories and seasons with a diet based on Brachiaria brizantha. Since this is an exploratory study, other sources of GHG emissions or carbon sequestration from cattle husbandry or LUC were not included.Results and ConclusionsAs shown on Table 1, for the period between 2010 and 2013, results show a decrease of both, grazing area (6.8%) and cattle herd (6.3%) while the number of animals sent to slaughter in the period increased 6.2%, meaning a general improvement on efficiency.312Changes in cattle herd composition and its implications on greenhouse gases emissions in Mato Grosso do Sul State between 2010 and 2014An important change on cattle herd structure in Mato Grosso do Sul could be noticed. There was an increase on number of young animals in the herd (1.1% for 00-12 months and 7.5% for 12-24 months) while animals between 24-36 months and older than 36 months decreased 11.8% and 14.9% respectively. This means that there were less mother cows producing a slightly higher number of calves. As well, steers were being finished faster, since number of animals sent to slaughter have increased. This leads to a smaller area of pastures and, therefore, average stocking rates have increased in the period.This change on herd structure affected the State\u2019s total estimated CH4enteric emissions from cattle. Total estimated herd emissions decreased 8.7%. This number raises to 14% when emissions per head cattle sent to slaughter is considered.This kind of estimates, especially without specific emissions rates for different animal categories, as well as important animal husbandry details on pasture quality and feeding leaves some uncertainty regarding the absolute GHG emission values.

As well, feeding cattle to speed up finishing reduces total enteric emissions per unit beef produced, but in the other hand, leads to GHG emissions somewhere else. This balance should be considered in the future, through more in-depth studies. Also regarding uncertainty, on the other hand, mother cows usually graze poorer quality pastures, what leads to higher CH4 emissions per head. In this study, since the same methane emission rates were used for the initial and final year, and there was a decrease of 12.4% in the number of females above 36 months of age in the herd, results presented can be considered conservative in this regard.Finally, regardless of emission rates adopted for calculating emissions, the fast and substantial decrease of 7.7% on emissions per unit beef produced per unit of area within three years, clearly shows that improvements on general herd efficiency can have an important reflexes on GHG emissions. Finally, as indicated by these numbers, improved cattle ranching efficiency in Brazil, led by higher average stocking rates, leads to substantial reductions on GHG emissions from the sector.ReferencesDEMARCHI, J.

Besides having one of the world\u00b4s biggest cattle herd (~200 mi heads), that impact is also related to the relatively low level of management of beef cattle production systems that prevents its full potential to be explored. Although, recent initiatives to increase beef production efficiency in Brazil, such as the PROGRAMA NOVO CAMPO carried out in the Amazon region, mainly through pasture restoration, has offered alternatives to farms in a transition from low investment and limited production to more efficient and productive systems. However, scarce information is available to indicate how specific intensification practices affect the balance of GHG emissions at farm level. Therefore, this paper seeks to complement existing regional initiatives by estimating GHG emissions of beef cattle farms participating in the PROGRAMA NOVO CAMPO.Material and MethodsThe first five farms participating in the PROGRAMA NOVO CAMPO were evaluated in this work. These farms are located in the region of Alta Floresta (MT) and cover approximately 3,500 ha and 7,500 beef 315Reducing GHG emissions and increasing beef production in the Brazilian Amazon: the case of PROGRAMA NOVO CAMPOcattle heads. At the beginning of the program in 2012, these farms had pastures predominantly degraded and reduced production capacity (~5@ ha-1yr-1). After joining the program, these farms had part of their pasture area (~10%) recovered for rotational grazing practice (with a stocking rate of 2-3 AU ha-1y-1) - which were maintained with fertilizer applications to the soil, including urea (100 kg N ha-1yr-1) and lime (averaging 300 kg ha-1yr-1). Along with the introduction of other practices given in the Manual of Boas Pr\u00e1ticas Agropecu\u00e1rias \u2013 Gado de Corte (BPA-Embrapa, 2011) and the Guidelines for Sustainable Beef Indicators (GIPS-GTPS, in preparation), after  2 years farms were able to increase meat production (carcass) in around 3 times.Using the GHG-Protocol Agr\u00edcola tool (WRI, 2014), GHG emissions balance of these five farms were accessed from November 2012 to November 2014 considering emissions from cattle, soil inputs and fossil fuel as well as emissions and removals from degraded and improved pastures (variation in soil C stocks), respectively.Results and ConclusionsBefore joining the NOVO CAMPO PROGRAM, the average GHG emissions of the five farms evaluated in this work were 0.4 and 78 t CO2e per hectare and per kilogram of carcass produced, respectively (Figure 1). The cattle (enteric fermentation and manure) were the main source of total emissions (60%), followed by the soil of the degraded pasture area (40%).316Reducing GHG emissions and increasing beef production in the Brazilian Amazon: the case of PROGRAMA NOVO CAMPOAfter joining the PROGRAMA NOVO CAMPO, these farms recovered 453 ha of degraded pastures, out of which 190 ha were with crop--livestock system, totalizing 13% of the total area covered by the pro-gram. With the introduction of complementary practices (BPA/GIPS), these farms were able to optimize their herd, discarding less producti-ve animals and accelerating the average slaughtering time in one year (Marcuzzo, 2015).During this process, farms began to gradually reduce their GHG emis-sions along with 150% more beef (carcass) produced, even accoun-ting with the emissions from regular application of urea to maintain the recovered pasture area. With smaller and more efficient herd, emissions by the cattle (enteric fermentation and manure) were redu-ced by 15% and soil carbon sequestration in the recovered pasture alleviated GHG emissions from soil degradation in 30%. As a result, two year after adopting improved practices, GHG emissions were redu-ced 20% per ha and 60% per kilogram of carcass produced (Figure 1). These results suggest the strategy adopted by the PROGRAMA NOVO CAMPO stands as an option for reducing GHG emissions from beef cattle farms along with higher meat production in the Brazilian Amazon region.Figure 1.

From this total, close to four million hectares are natural grasslands in the Pantanal wetlands. The balance, or about 16 million hectares, are sown pastures. The State Secretary of Agriculture (Secretaria de Estado de Produ\u00e7\u00e3o e Agricultura Familiar - SEPAF) estimated that at least 50% of the total cultivated pasture are degraded or with some degree of degradation. These areas have low productivity and may negatively affect environment.To face the problem of degraded pastures, SEPAF created the \u201cTerra Boa Program\u201d focused on the improvement of pastures in Mato Grosso do Sul (SEPAF, 2016). The Program aims \u201cto promote, within five years, restoration and maintenance of production capacity for two million hectares of degraded pastures in the state\u201d. The Program addresses seven major actions: (i) improvement of pastures; (ii) conversion of pastures into cropland; (iii) integrated crop- livestock systems; (iv) integrated crop-livestock-forestry systems; (v) integrated livestock- forestry systems; (vi) conversion of pastures into sugarcane farming; and (vii) afforestation.319Terra Boa Program for Pasture Improvement: Potential Impact on Greenhouse Gasses Mitigation through soils in Mato Grosso do Sul (MS) StateAll the systems proposed by the Terra Boa Program have potential for not only improving cattle husbandry, grain farming, bioenergy and fo-restry production, but also reducing greenhouse gases emissions from those areas. A pasture when degraded has a low carbon stock in the soil. Additionally, beef production per unit of area is much lower when compared to improved pastures, since cattle takes longer to reach slaughtering weights. This implies in higher total enteric GHG emissions per animal.The Terra Boa Program is integrated to the State Program on Climate Change (PROCLIMA), which shall implement the State Policy on Climate Change, complying with the State Law 4.555/2014 (Lei 4.555/2014). Mato Grosso do Sul assumed a voluntary reduction in greenhouse gases emissions (GHG) of 20% by 2020 with the year 2005 as baseline.In this work, we aimed to estimate the potential contribution of the Terra Boa Program to mitigate greenhouse gases emissions in the next five years, considering only the carbon absorption into soils.Material and MethodsEstimated Land Use Change (LUC) between 2016 and 2020 was based on Terra Boa Program targets set by the State Secretary of Agriculture (SEPAF) (Table 1), where LUC was allocated into seven groups: improvement of pastures; conversion into cropland; conversion into integrated crop-livestock system (ICL); conversion into integrated crop-livestock-forestry systems (ICLF); conversion into integrated livestock-forestry systems (ILF); conversion into sugarcane; and afforestation.As for carbon sequestration rates, we adopted estimated values of the ABC Observatory (OBSERVAT\u00d3RIO ABC, 2015) for improved pastures (1.0 Mg C-CO2e ha-1 yr-1), crops (considered under no-tillage) (0.5 Mg C-CO2e ha-1 yr-1), ICL (1.5 Mg C-CO2e ha-1 yr-1), ICLF (1.5 Mg C-CO2e ha-1 yr-1), and ILF (1.0 Mg C-CO2e ha-1 yr-1). Sequestration rates adopted for sugar cane were 1.62 Mg C-CO2e ha-1 yr-1 (Carvalho et al, 2010). As for afforestation, we considered the rate of 1.22 Mg C-CO2e ha-1  yr-1  (Corazza et al 1999).320Terra Boa Program for Pasture Improvement: Potential Impact on Greenhouse Gasses Mitigation through soils in Mato Grosso do Sul (MS) StateResults and ConclusionsThe expected changes in land use triggered by the Terra Boa Program (Table 1) have the potential to sequester 2.134 Mt C-CO2e ha-1 yr-1 (Table 2). This represents about 10% of the estimated GHG emissions related to total local cattle herd in 2014. The System Study Greenhou-se Gas Emissions Estimates (SEEG) reported an estimated emission due to enteric fermentation of cattle in Mato Grosso do Sul of 22 M t C-CO2e ha-1 yr-1, in 2014 (SEEG, 2016). The largest potential was registered to direct improvement of pastures, which represents the most representative LUC expected.Table 1.

The GHG mitigation potential of the Program is significant in terms of total emission related to current beef production in Mato Grosso do Sul. The Program has also the potential to increase the land productivity as a whole, reducing emissions per unit of beef produced. We conclude that Terra Boa Program is an important public policy initiative with a high potential to contribute to mitigate GHG emissions in Mato Grosso do Sul, helping the State to reach its voluntary reduction targets towards 2020.

Under the Climate Change act of 2008 there is a long-term legally binding requirement to reduce national emissions by at least 80% below the 1990 baseline by 2050, with interim reductions of at least 34% by 2020. Agricultural emissions made up 9% of the total greenhouse gas emissions in 2014, and these are associated with some of the highest uncertainties in national inventory reports (DECC 2016). For this reason a large programme of research has been undertaken in the UK in order to reduce uncertainties associated with agricultural greenhouse gas reporting and to support the development of mitigation actions. This has involved a co- ordinated programme of research to quantify emissions of nitrous oxide from fertilisers and livestock wastes, and enteric methane emissions, the Greenhouse Gas Platform. Work is also being undertaken to improve reporting of greenhouse gas emissions and removals from the Land Use Land Use Change and Forestry sector. Highlights of this research and the implica-tions for national inventory reporting are presented.323Improving agricultural inventories of GHG emissions: A UK case studyMaterials and MethodsNitrous oxide emissions were measured from the range of nitrogen sources that are added to soils under contrasting soil and climatic conditions across the UK. Experiments used standard protocols for experimental design, measurements, data handling and statistical analysis. Measurements of methane emissions from livestock (focusing on cattle and sheep) were used to generate Emission Factors that were representative of different breeds and systems and assess the effect of nutrition (basal forages, concentrates supplements and feed additives). A parallel process of verification and modelling of the data obtained from these research activities was undertaken. Greenhouse gas emissions are also reported from Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF). IPCC guidelines (IPCC, 2006) are currently used to report emissions resulting from land use change and a study is being carried out to determine whether this reporting can be extended to include cropland and grassland management.Results and ConclusionsGreenhouse gas emissions from agriculture have remained relatively constant over the past five years, despite significant reductions of emissions in other sectors (Table 1). This places increased pressure agriculture to reduce emissions if overall emission reduction targets are to be met.Table 1. UK greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture (Mt CO2e) National Inventory Report).1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2013 2014Carbon dioxide 7.0 7.1 5.7 5.6 5.2 5.3 5.3Methane 32.6 32.0 30.8 28.7 27.2 27.0 27.4Nitrous oxide 19.2 19.0 18.0 16.6 15.9 15.8 16.3Total 58.7 58.1 54.6 50.9 48.3 48.1 49.1324Improving agricultural inventories of GHG emissions: A UK case studyThe Greenhouse Gas Platform research has provided improved understanding of emissions from agricultural sources. The observed nitrous oxide Emission Factor (EF1 is the proportion of N2O derived from a nitrogen source) for fertilisers applied to grasslands was 1.3 %, however, the Emission Factor for fertiliser applied to arable crops ranged between 0.5-0.8 % (depending on the nitrogen source) which is below the 1% Tier 1 default value. Nitrous oxide emissions from grazing returns by cattle were also significantly lower than default IPCC values with Emission Factors from dung of 0.2%, and urine of 0.7%, giving a combined weighted Emission Factor of 0.5% (as compared with the default Emission Factor from these sources of 2%). These new Tier 2 nitrous oxide Emission Factors are currently being applied to the UK\u2019s inventory reports increasing the relative importance of methane as a greenhouse gas (Fig. 1).Enteric methane emissions from beef cattle and sheep, showed a limited effect of breed and breed type on emissions. There was a much greater effect of diet type, with animals consuming more higher-quality (lowland) forage than poorer-quality (upland) forages and consequently producing more methane each day on the better quality feeds. This research provided validation of the Tier 2 Emission Factors used to report methane emissions from UK livestock.Figure 1. Relative importance of UK agricultural greenhouse gases in inventory reports for 2015 and 2016.325Improving agricultural inventories of GHG emissions: A UK case studyGreenhouse gas emissions from Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry were responsible for an annual uptake of 9 Mt CO2e in 2014, mostly from the forestry sector. Research is currently being under-taken to establish opportunities to report carbon sequestration by the managment of grasslands remaining grasslands and croplands re-maining croplands. Early indications would suggest that this will have only a minor impact on overall greenhouse gas emissions and remo-vals from the agriculture and LULUCF sectors.This research highlights the importance of the non-CO2 greenhouse gases in contributing to emissions from agricultural production, and provides improved opportunities to mitigation actions that will deliver further emissions reductions.ReferencesDECC 2016. 2014 UK Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Final Figures.

E-mail address of presenting author*: victoresteves@poli.ufrj.brIntroductionAt the same time agriculture is a major source of economic resources for Brazil, it also plays a major role on national greenhouse gases emissions. Brazil has being adopting responsible measures not only to reduce emissions from agriculture, but also to turn it into a sink. The first step to develop sustainable policies in the subject is to  have a systematic overview of land use change (LUC) dynamics in major and representative agricultural areas of  the country. In this sense, Literature might offer different figures for GHG emissions from the different land uses. However, for reliable estimates, a sound basis of LUC assessment is essential.In this regard, intending to support estimates of Greenhouse Gases (GHG) emissions from LUC this work has carried out a LUC assessment through analysis of satellite imagery for the regions of Dourados in Mato Grasso do Sul State, Alto Teles Pires and Sinop in Mato Grosso State. These two areas were chosen for their relevance on soybeans farming and the different characteristics of their clearing for cultivation. The LUC analysis covered the period between 1993 and 2013 with temporal scale of 10 years (1993, 2003 and 2013).327Using imagery satellite to assess the Land Use Change (LUC) from natural and grazing areas to crop farming in Central BrazilMaterial and MethodsInitially crop farming areas were identified in Landsat satellite images of the last year of the study period (2013) and then compared to the images from the middle (2003) and initial year (1993). Images were a combination of three bands available from Landsat, yielding images with false-color composition, with spectral information outside the sensitive range of the human eye (Piroli et al., 2002), which support identification and differentiation of land use classes to be studied. Applying the methodology described in Esteves et al. (2016), areas were classified as: natural areas (savannah and forest) and agricultural areas (soybean and pasture), following color and texture patterns characteristic for each of these classes.Figure 1 illustrates the image processing method, showing the main characteristics of each class analyzed: i.e, crop farming with uniform color and smooth texture in each batch; sown pasture with non-uniform color and smooth texture in each batch; rain forest with red color due to intense photosynthetic activity and wrinkled texture caused by tree shading and finally savannah with red and green color and little wrinkled texture.328Using imagery satellite to assess the Land Use Change (LUC) from natural and grazing areas to crop farming in Central BrazilFigure 1: Methodology of analyzed classes329Using imagery satellite to assess the Land Use Change (LUC) from natural and grazing areas to crop farming in Central BrazilResultsThe method for satellite imagery analysis for a larger time horizon proved effective and allowed rather good mapping for comparison with images from recent years. Results evidence substantial difference on LUC patterns in the two regions studied. This might be linked to the time when agricultural expansion reached these zones, being influenced by differences like in infrastructure and environmental regulations as well as by the kind of land cover itself.Figure 2 shows LUC for the periods between 2003 and 2013 and from 1993 to 2013, in the State of Mato Grosso do Sul State. Regar-ding the 20 years period, it can be observed  that LUC was essentially through conversion of sown pastures to crop farming, mostly soybe-ans. Higher proportions of pastures being converted to crop farming indicate intensification of cattle ranching in the area, since beef pro-duction in the area has been constant with even some increase in the last years (Bungenstab et al, 2014).In the period between 2003 and 2013, a reduction on LUC can be noticed as well as a substantial reduction of LUC as a whole and especially on converting natural areas, especially savannah into crop farming. This can be explained by the fact that in Mato Grosso do Sul, agricultural expansion, converting natural areas to sown pastures occurred prior 1993 whose areas of more fertile soils were converted to crop farming, essentially soybeans.In the other hand, in the State of Mato Grosso, were agricultural ex-pansion occurred later, LUC converting natural areas (savannah and rain forest) directly to crop farming were more than 70% of the total LUC in the period between 1993 to 2013, showing a rather diffe-rent pattern of agricultural expansion. However, in the last decade, clearing natural areas was330Using imagery satellite to assess the Land Use Change (LUC) from natural and grazing areas to crop farming in Central Brazilsubstantially reduced showing 32% conversion of natural areas and 59% of no LUC. It can be speculated that this is due to improve-ments on environmental law enforcement and land tenure issues, as well as some change of farmers focus, aiming at better yields instead of larger low fertility areas.Figure 2: Land Use Change between 1993 and 2013 for Mato Grosso do Sul State, Brazil.Figure 3: Land Use Change between 1993 and 2013 for Mato Grosso State, Brazil.331Using imagery satellite to assess the Land Use Change (LUC) from natural and grazing areas to crop farming in Central BrazilConclusionsTherefore, this work proves that, when estimating GHG emissions from LUC in Brazil, scientists must have a close look on time scales and regional characteristics, segmenting assessments by small regions and avoiding generalizations in order not to go into miscalculations that would lead to wrong conclusions and poor orientation for policy making in both, national and international levels.ReferencesBungenstab, D.

Today the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere reaches 400 ppm mark according to the latest reports (NOAA, 2015). Brazil is one of the most important countries in the global livestock and according to the United Nations  (UN) livestock is responsible for 14.5% of GHG emissions (RURAL BR, 2014).  Agriculture  can be an important ally for the CO2  mitigation concentration in the atmosphere because  contains3.3 times (about 2500 gigatons) more than carbon the atmosphere (760 gigatons). CO2 atmospheric can be converted to vegetable mass through biota photosynthesis and this carbon will be retain on soil through a well management of this mass. This mechanism is named as \u201ccarbon sequestration\u201d.The SOM (soil organic matter) is defined as a mixture of compoun-ds in various decomposition stages resulting from plants and animals biodegradation. The chemical characteristics of this organic material are an important indicator for the soil quality classification and about the management practices adopted to that soil. Stable fractions (or 333Soil carbon stocks and humification index under Brazilian livestock production systems in the Atlantic forest biome.humidified) of SOM are directly influenced by soil management, hu-mification index shows how the MOS is stable, ie resistant to microbial decomposition. According to Embrapa Agrobiology, more than 50% of the areas under pasture are in the degradation process. Thus, the SOM decreases, and carbon returns to the air in the form of CO2  (ALVES et al., 2003).The main goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of recovery of pastures, under different management systems in the Atlantic Forest Biome, on soil carbon stocks (SCS) and SOM humification, aiming at identifying GHG mitigation alternatives for the cattle raising sector in Brazil. The work also aims to conduct a comparative study of the carbon stocks in the depths of 0-30 cm and 0-100 cm.Material and MethodsThe experiment was carried in two different grazing systems for cat-tle and a forest native area located in the Embrapa\u2019s Southeast Lives-tock Research Center in S\u00e3o Carlos / SP. The first area is a recovery grazing system (A3), which is performed liming and fertilization with nitrogen (urea) and the second area corresponds to a degraded system where any kind of correction or control was not performed (A4), both under Brachiaria decumbens pasture. A native forest area near from the experiment (Atlantic Forest) was used as a positive reference. Samples were collected at the following depths 0-5, 5-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40, 40-60, 60-80 and 80-100 cm in six field replicates for each of the three areas concerned. Carbon stocks and SOM quality evalua-tion were studied in both pasture systems and in the forest area.334Soil carbon stocks and humification index under Brazilian livestock production systems in the Atlantic forest biome.The samples preparation consisted of soil drying at room temperature and cleaning the samples, such as the removal of roots and plant re-sidues, and soil homogenization. The soil was gently crushed using a mortar and pestle and passed through a 100 mesh sieve for elemental carbon analyses (CHNS) and the humification index determination.In a previous study, Xavier (2014) compared methods for soil C stocks calculation: estimation based on a fixed mass (VELDKAMP, 1994) and in order to correct differences caused by land use changes in the soil density estimation using the normalized C content of each soil layer (ELLERT; BETTANY, 1995; SISTI et al., 2004). The SCS were corrected for each system evaluated using as a reference equiva-lent soil mass under native vegetation (Atlantic Forest), or using the equivalent mass calculation.For SOM evaluation quality pellets were made from soil to 100 mesh. Then, the samples were analyzed by Laser-Induced Fluorescence Spectroscopy (LIFS) equipped with a diode laser emitting continuous wavelength of 405nm with a power source of around 200 mW. The spectral window was 475-800 nm, with an intensity of 0-4000, inte-gration time 500 ms. For obtain the humification average index were collected five spectra for each sample.The ratio of the area under fluorescence emission bands and the total  organic C content (g kg-1) was defined as the SOM humification index (HLIFS) (MILORI ET AL., 2006).Results and ConclusionsIn this work SCS were evaluated in two ranges layers, 0-30cm and 30-100cm both evaluations using equivalent mass calculation. The results showed that until 1m-depth A3 showed the highest SCS with 142 Mg ha-1 versus 99 Mg ha-1 of A4 and MT with 115Mg ha-1. The SCS for the first 30 cm layers, A3 showed a SCS with 64Mg ha-1, A4 with 39Mg ha-1 and MT with 50 Mg ha-1. The interesting aspect 335Soil carbon stocks and humification index under Brazilian livestock production systems in the Atlantic forest biome.of this trial results was the different contributions of soil layers. Car-bon stocks calculated for the 0-30 cm layers represented an average of 43% of the total C accumulation and the 30-100 cm layers with about 57% of the total C stocks, for all pasture systems. Therefore, it is important to emphasize the importance of sampling deep soil layers, especially when studding pastures established with grasses with abundant root system such as Brachiaria. Results indicate that the most amount of soil C is stored in deep layers.For the SOM quality, lower humification indexes were obtained for the surface layers of all soils where occurrence of labile C derived from a continuous supply of fresh material from the cover vegetation and ani-mals (Figure 2). In deeper layers, there is an increase in the HLIFS due to the presence of more recalcitrant C, provided by unsaturated organic compounds containing double bonds and condensed rings.Figure 1: Humification index (HLIFS); A3 \u2013 recovering system, A4 \u2013 degra-ded system, MT \u2013 Native forest336Soil carbon stocks and humification index under Brazilian livestock production systems in the Atlantic forest biome.The analyses of SOM humification complements soil C stocks because the LIFS technique measures recalcitrant C, what can be a sensitive indicator of variances caused by changes in land use and soil manage-ment. The \u201cvulnerability\u201d of C is checked in this kind of assessment. In this study, A3 systems, which had the highest C stock values, are susceptible to CO2 losses if the management is not appropriate, mainly due to the high lability of their soil C, especially at the surface layers.The soil C stocks associated with the humification indexes showed an alarming situation due to the carbon stored there has a lower humifi-cation degree in all layers.   This fact reminds us of the fragility of this system to inadequate management. Systems with high C stocks are susceptible to CO2 losses to atmosphere if the management is not ap-propriate, mainly due to the high lability of soil C. Results indicate the capacity of well  managed tropical grasses to mitigate GHG emissions from livestock production systems.ReferencesALVES, B. J. R; BODDEY, R. M.; CABALLERO, S. S. U.

With a large territory, favorable climate for plant growth throu-ghout the year and advanced silvicultural technology, Brazil has strong vocation for forestry, fully complying with the provisions of the CDM.Eucalyptus plantations are highly efficient in atmospheric CO2 removal, because they can store large amounts of carbon in all plant parts. Due to Brazilian favorable climatic conditions (rainfall and photoperiod), it is possible to obtain high conversion rates of CO2 into biomass by eu-calyptus trees, due to rapid growth and consequently high productivity.In Brazil, a large part of eucalypt plantations supply pulp and paper industry, maintaining therefore the carbon stored. Due to the high productivity, eucalyptus cultivation cycles for pulp and paper produc-tion last seven years in average, favoring atmospheric CO2 capture, 339Carbon sequestration potential by different eucalyptus genotypesonce growth rate for younger trees is higher compared to older trees. However, due to genetic diversity, different eucalyptus genotypes have different growth rates, which result in different carbon accumulation capacities.Thus, the objective of this research was evaluating the productivity of eucalyptus relating it to potential carbon sequestration and accumula-tion by different genetic materials.Material and MethodsThe experiment was carried out at the Embrapa Beef Cattle research center in Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul State, Brazil, located between the geographical coordinates: 20\u00ba27\u201902\u201d S and 54\u00ba43\u201907\u201d W.. Soil was a distroferric red latosol (LVdf), Climate under K\u00f6ppen classification is a transition zone between Cfa and Aw wet tropical. Mean annual rainfall is 1,560 mm, with rainy summer and a dry light cold winter.Experimental design was randomized block, with seven treatments and three repetitions. Seven Eucalyptus genotypes were used: 1277 (E. camaldulensis x E. grandis), I- 144 (E. urophyla), I-224 (E. urophyla x E. grandis) GG 100 (E. urophyla x E. grandis), H13 (E. urophyla x E. grandis), H77 (E. urophyla x E. grandis) and Corymbia citriodora (single genotype from seminal seedlings). All genotypes are classified as multi purpose. Each experimental plot had 48 plants, with 3 meters x 2 meters spacing (1,666 plants per hectare).340Carbon sequestration potential by different eucalyptus genotypesMeasurements of total height and diameter at breast height (DBH) were performed at 48 months after planting. From the height and DBH data, the volume of timber per plant was calculated (using the form factor equal to 0.45) as well was the volume of timber per hectare, using the equation proposed by Porf\u00edrio-da-Silva et al. (2009).The carbon contet on stem was determined using CN analyzer (Sumika Chemical Sumigraph CN 900), according to methodology employed by Kanda et al. (2004). CO2 eq. was estimated using a conversion factor of 3.67.Analysis of variance was carried out and, when there were significant differences up to 5% significance between means, these means were compared by Scott Knott test with 5% probability, using SISVAR software (Ferreira, 2008).Results and ConclusionsTable 1 shows that 48 months after planting, genetic materials studied showed statistically significant differences for all traits. The DBH va-lues of clones I-144 and I-224 were similar to those for the GG 100 and 1277 clones, but the GG 100 and 1277 clones showed greater heights of plants.Analyzing volume of timber per tree, it can be noticed a formation of three distinct groups, where H77 and H13 clones and C. citriodora genotype had the worst performers and GG 100 clones and 1277 the best production of timber per tree, with the others genotypes in the intermediate group. Production of timber per hectare was linearly influenced by these results, keeping the same groupings for that cha-racteristic.341Carbon sequestration potential by different eucalyptus genotypesWood yield (m\u00b3 ha-1) has direct relation with the capacity to sequester and store carbon from the atmosphere by trees, so it can be seen in Figure 1 that the GG 100 and 1277 clones were superior to others when the accumulated carbon content is considered in the tree stem and the equivalent carbon dioxide amount removed from atmosphere. Measurements of total height and diameter at breast height (DBH) were performed at 48 months after planting. From the height and DBH data, the volume of timber per plant was calculated (using the form factor equal to 0.45) as well was the volume of timber per hectare, using the equation proposed by Porf\u00edrio-da-Silva et al.

Results and Conclusions Table 1 shows that 48 months after planting, genetic materials studied showed statistically significant differences for all traits. The DBH values of clones I-144 and I-224 were similar to those for the GG 100 and 1277 clones, but the GG 100 and 1277 clones showed greater heights of plants. Analyzing volume of timber per tree, it can be noticed a formation of three distinct groups, where H77 and H13 clones and C. citriodora genotype had the worst performers and GG 100 clones and 1277 the best production of timber per tree, with the others genotypes in the intermediate group.

Wood yield (m\u00b3 ha-1) has direct relation with the capacity to sequester and store carbon from the atmosphere by trees, so it can be seen in Figure 1 that the GG 100 and 1277 clones were superior to others when the accumulated carbon content is considered in the tree stem and the equivalent carbon dioxide amount removed from atmosphere.  Figure 1. Accumulated carbon amount in the tree stem and amount of CO2eq removed from the atmosphere by the different eucalyptus genotypes at 48 months of age.

Thus, it can be concluded that there is variability in the carbon sequestration capacity by different eucalyptus genotypes and the GG 100 and 1277 clones have the greatest potential for environmental services when it comes to capturing atmospheric carbon dioxide.

However, only after 1980 was that the changes in the levels of GHG were scientifically evident. This finding led to the establishment in 1988, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).In 1997, during the Conference of the Parties (COP) held in Japan, the Kyoto Protocol was established in order to reduce the emission of GHGs mainly by industrialized countries. Among the mechanisms cited for compensation of GHG emissions there is the Clean Develo-pment Mechanism (CDM).Developing countries, e.g. Brazil, started the implementation of the CDM to generate carbon credits to be traded with developed coun-tries, since they have committed to reduce GHG emissions. Through calculating the GHG that had their volumes avoided and/or removed from the atmosphere emissions, carbon credits are generated. Each carbon credit is equal to a stored GHG ton and/or that have not been released into the atmosphere and they may be negotiated between developed and developing countries.344Comparison between carbon stock measurements methods in eucalyptus stemsThe forest carbon sequestration is one way of CDM in which trees  remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and accumulate in the woody matter. By presenting strong forestry vocation, Brazil has great potential for the implementation of CDM projects, and on a global market and increasingly competitive, the possibility of adding value to planted forests by the Forest Carbon Sequestration reinforces the need for projects on forest management and forest measurement.Thus, this study aimed to compare two carbon stock assessment me-thodologies in eucalyptus trees.Material and MethodsThe experiment was carried out in Ribas do Rio Pardo, Mato Grosso do Sul State, Brazil, on a farm located between the GPS coordinates 20\u00b026\u201909\u201d and 20\u00b027\u201931\u201dS and 53\u00b056\u201913\u201d and 53\u00b057\u201943\u201dW. The soil of the experimental area is classified as Typic Quartzarenic Orthic (Santos et al., 2013). The weather pattern of the area is classified, ac-cording to Koppen (1948), as a transition between CFA and humid Aw.The experimental data, as well as tree fragments were obtained from forests of clonal eucalyptus H77 (Eucalyptus urophylla x Eucalyp-tus grandis), aged between 12, 24 and 36 months. The determination of wood density was held at Plant Physiology and Analytical Chemistry Laboratories of Anhanguera-Uniderp University/Campo Grande (Brazil).After the characterization of forest stands were selected 12 trees of each age (12, 24   and 36 months), totaling 36 samples, representing all ages of the evaluated population. It was measured the height of the stem and the stem diameter without bark at breast height (diameter at breast height \u2013 DBH - 1.30 meters above ground).345Comparison between carbon stock measurements methods in eucalyptus stemsJust after the measurements, the selected trees were cut for collect a 10 cm disc of stem at the DBH, for determining the density of the wood, according to the methodology proposed by Vital (1984) and the amount of carbon stored in the stem, according to the methodolo-gy proposed by Tedesco et al. (1995) and by Walkley-Black method with external heat, described by Allison (1965).To estimate the carbon stored in the stem, it was considered that 50% of the total biomass consists of carbon (Soares et al., 2005).Results and ConclusionsThe amount of carbon in the stem determined by destructive and non-destructive methods according to the age of the trees are shown in Table 1. The availability of papers about wood density as a function of tree age and spatial arrangement are scarce in the literature, so we used the same average wood density for the carbon stock calculations for both methods.Table 1.

The regression analysis shows high correlation - upper than 99% (Figure 1) \u2013 between two methods for determining the carbon stock in the stems of eucalyptus trees for all ages studied. These results corroborate Reis et al. (1994) that found high correlation between destructive and nondestructive methods for determining carbon in tree stems. Therefore, the nondestructive method can be used to estimate the carbon stock in the stems of eucalyptus trees with a high degree of confidence and with the advantages of higher efficiency and lower cost.  In Figures 2, 3 and 4 are shown separately, the regression equations and correlation between destructive and nondestructive methods for each age studied. We conclude that the two methods compared to the determination of carbon eucalyptus stems have high correlation. The determination of the amount of carbon stored in the stems of eucalyptus plants by non-destructive method has high reliability.   346Comparison between carbon stock measurements methods in eucalyptus stemsThe regression analysis shows high correlation - upper than 99% (Figure 1) \u2013 between two methods for determining the carbon stock in the stems of eucalyptus trees for all ages studied.

Therefore, the nondestructive method can be used to estimate the carbon stock in the stems of eucalyptus trees with a high degree of confidence and with the advantages of higher efficiency and lower cost.In Figures 2, 3 and 4 are shown separately, the regression equa-tions and correlation between destructive and nondestructive methods for each age studied.We conclude that the two methods compared to the determination of carbon eucalyptus stems have high correlation. The determination of the amount of carbon stored in the stems of eucalyptus plants by non-destructive method has high reliability.347Comparison between carbon stock measurements methods in eucalyptus stemsFigure 1.

A sound understanding about C sequestration potential in soil could be crucial for the development of effective management approaches in order to reduce CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere as well as to maintain the ecosystem sustainability. In the Pantanal ecosystem landscapes have a diversified floristic composition and structure. They are consisted by a mosaic of different phytophysionomic features, which are influenced by edaphic factors and variable flooding levels. Fur-thermore, they have sustained a livestock production with a low level of external inputs, especially regarding to soil management. This study aimed to evaluate the soil carbon and nitrogen storage under different landscape units in the Pantanal ecosystem.Material and MethodsThe study was carry out at the Embrapa Pantanal experimental farm, whose landscape is representative of the most part of the Nhe-colandia sub-region. Four different landscape units were studied: fores-ted savannah; arboreal savannah; grassland savannah with Mesosetum chaseae, and open grassland with Axonopus purpusii (these areas su-350Carbon and nitrogen stocks in soil under different landscape units at the Pantanal ecosystem, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazilffer seasonal flooding at contrary grassland savanna with M. chaseae the are no flooding areas). Soil samples were collected at 0-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40, 40-60, 60-80 and 80-100 cm depths, in three trenches to determine soil bulk density, and in four different transects, accounting 315 samples per landscape unit (45 per depth). The C and N content were assessed by dry combustion in a CHNS analyzer equip-ment. The results were submitted to ANOVA, and the multiple means comparisons were performed by the Tukey test at 5% probability.Results and ConclusionsThe larger C stocks were found out at 0-10 and 10-20 cm depths in the forested savannah and in the open grassland with A. purpusii landscape units (respectively 10.76 and 8.33 Mg C ha-1 in open grassland with A. purpusii and 6.53 and 5.09 Mg C ha-1 in forested savannah) (Table 1). Taking in account the layer 0-100 cm, the C storage was significantly higher in open grassland with A. purpusii (33.54 Mg C ha-1) and in forested savannah (33.03 Mg C ha-1). Lower contents occurred in grassland savannah with M. chaseae (23.99 Mg C ha-1) and in arboreal savannah (21.91 Mg C ha-1). These landscape units are characterized by natural environments and these soils have never been submitted to any kind of management. Therefore, the results of the open grassland with A. purpusii unit might be related to the vegetal residue deposition provided by the annual cycle of flooding, mainly aquatic weeds. Moreover, it may be also related to the soil organic matter quality. Prevailing the presence of recalcitrant C fractions could give rise to a protected compartment, which keeps the C in more stable forms. On the other hand, the C stocks of forest savannah may be due to the higher amount of organic residue and to the litter production provided by a dense and diversified tree vegetation. The reduced soil C storage in the arboreal savannah and grassland savannah with M. chaseae units may be associated with a grazing pressure because they remain flood-free in the most part of the year, which allows them to be highly used by cattle. 351Carbon and nitrogen stocks in soil under different landscape units at the Pantanal ecosystem, Mato Grosso do Sul, BrazilBesides that, the presence of a dominant vegetation consisted by herbaceous plants under scattered woody plants. It leads to the addition of small organic material amounts to the soil. Regarding N stocks, variations were observed among the landscapes units and soil depths (Table 1). However, significant difference was not detected when the 0-100 cm layer was taking in account. The values were ranging from 2.41 to 3.62 Mg N ha-1, which indicates low capacity of N storage in the soil. The Pantanal natural pastures are subjected to a continuous defoliation, imposed by the grazing pressure. This situation characterizes these environments as an ecosystems marked by merely biomass extraction and almost no nutrients or organic material replacement, except the animals excreta, which are deposited in specific locations. In natural low fertility and unfertilized ecosystems like Pantanal, the main source of nutrients for plants comes from the processes of soil organic matter decomposition and mineralization (MOREIRA e MALAVOLTA, 2004). The depletion of C stocks in soil could bring lower resilience level, which could result in an impairment of the productive capacity and less ecosystem services supply.Table 1.

This study was conducted to determine the carbon stock in a Ultisol under a pure Brachiaria humidicola (Rendle) Scheick pasture and a mixed pasture of B. humidicola and Arachis pintoi Krapov. & W. C. Greg cv. BRS Man-dobi, both without fertilization. A native forest classified as Bamboo open+dense, on the same soil type, was the reference land use with 137 Mg ha-1 of above-ground live biomass (SALIMON et al, 2011).Material and MethodsThe experiment was stablished in 2011 at the Guaxup\u00e9 farm in Rio Branco, state of Acre, Brazil. Deforestation of the experimental area occurred in 1981. Soil sampling was carried in the pure Brachiaria hu-midicola pasture (G), in the mixed pasture of B. humidicola and Arachis pintoi cv. BRS Mandobi (GL), and in a native forest (NF) classified as Bamboo open+dense, on the same soil type. In order to account for inter annual variation, soil carbon stocks  were  measured  in  2012  and  2015,  in  the  0-0.05,  0.05-0.10,  0.10-0.15, 0.15-0.20, 0.20-0.30, 0.30-0.40, 0.40-0.50, 0.50-0.70, 0.70-0.90 and 0.90-1.10 354Soil carbon sequestration in grass and grass-legume pastures in the western Brazilian Amazonm layers. Carbon (C) content (EMBRAPA, 2011) and soil bulk density (BLAKE e HARTGE, 1986) were determined and C stocks calculated (ELLERT e BETTANY, 1995). Data of soil C stocks for 2012 and 2015 were averaged for the three land uses (NF, G and GL).Results and ConclusionsThere was difference (P < 0.05) in soil C stock among the different land uses. Soil C stocks (Mg C ha-1) were 52.8 \u00b1 2.2 in the NF, 72 \u00b1 5.5 in the pure G pasture and 65 \u00b1 10.9 in the mixed GL pasture. Soil C stock in pure G pasture was greater than in NF but similar to mixed GL pasture. There was no difference between soil C stock of NF and mixed GL pasture (Figure 1).Soil C stocks in the pure G and in the mixed GL pastures represent gains of 36% and 23% respectively, over 34 years in relation to the NF (Figure1). This means a rate of soil C accumulation (Mg ha-1 year-1) of 0.56 and 0.36 in the pure G and in the mixed GL pas-tures respectively in this time span. This calculation does not consider the C stock in the aboveground biomass that was lost by burning during deforestation in 1981. In this respect, the gain of soil C stock in the pure G and mixed GL pastures represent 14% and 9%, respec-tively of the 137 Mg C ha-1 in the above-ground live biomass in the NF (SALIMON et al, 2011).Soil C accumulated in the pure G and mixed GL pastures in relation to the NF, over the 34 year period, was 70.3 and 44.5 Mg CO2 ha-1, respectively. This indicates that the pastures are functioning as a C-CO2 drain from the atmosphere, offsetting part of the carbon lost since deforestation in 1981.355Soil carbon sequestration in grass and grass-legume pastures in the western Brazilian AmazonReferencesBLAKE, G.

Depending on the characteristics of the area and management system adopted, these changes may jeopardize the role of soil as one carbon (C) sink on the Earth. A sound understanding of C sequestration potential in soil could be crucial for the development of practical management appro-aches, to reduce CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere as well as to maintain the sustainability of production systems. In the Pantanal, the establishment of cultivated pastures in no- flooded savannah areas is one of the major land-use changes in the region. They receive no fertili-zation, and the maintenance of satisfactory levels of production depen-ds on the nutrients naturally released into the soil by the decomposition and mineralization processes related to the SOM dynamics. The goal of this study was to estimate the soil C and N stocks under Urochloa spp. pasture with a natural forested savannah as a reference.Material and MethodsThe experiment was carried at the Embrapa Pantanal experimental farm. The studied areas comprised an Urochloa pasture spp., introdu-ced about 21 years ago in an area under non-flooded forested savan-357Soil carbon and nitrogen stocks under natural forested savannah and cultivatedpasture in the Pantanal, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazilnah, and as a reference for comparison purposes a natural non-flooded forested savannah adjacent to pasture, which floristic composition and structural and edaphic characteristics are similar to the deforested area. The pasture has never received any fertilizer. It has been using for lac-tating females and newly weaned calves. When necessary, the pasture has submitted to cleaning by mowing. Soil samples were collected at depths 0-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40, 40-60, 60-80 and 80-100 cm in three trenches, to determine soil bulk density, and in four different transects amounting 315 samples per area (45 per depth). The C and N content were assessed by dry combustion in a CHNS analyzer equi-pment. The stocks from the pasture area were fixed for the same soil mass according to Carvalho et al. (2009). Since the results were not normally distributed, the Kruskal-Wallis/Wilcoxon nonparametric test for means comparisons at 5% of probability was used.Results and ConclusionsAccording to Figure 1a, one observes that the higher soil C storage occurred in the sub-surface layers (p <0.05) in both of the areas. Under the natural forested savannah, a larger soil storage C was found at the layer 0-30 cm (13.719 and 10.934 Mg C ha-1, respectively, for natural forested savannah and Urochloa spp. pasture). Regarding the layer of 40-100 cm deep, the soil C stocks were higher in the area under pasture (23.021 and 18.691 Mg C ha-1, respectively, for Urochloa spp. pasture and natural forested savannah). When one considers the 0-100 cm layer, however, it appears that there were no differences between areas (33.995 and 32.409 Mg C ha-1). These results suggest that 21 years after pasture implantation there was no reduction the in soil C stock when compared to the primary area once the loss of C in its surface layers was offset by the higher stora-ge in the deeper soil layers. As for the soil C, the soil N storage is also greater in the sub-surface layers (Figure 1b). However, a statistical difference  (p <0.05) was observed only in the 0-30 cm layer, with stocks ranging from 1.028 to 1.364 Mg N ha-1, respectively, for the 358Soil carbon and nitrogen stocks under natural forested savannah and cultivatedpasture in the Pantanal, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazilsoil under Urochloa spp. pasture and natural forested savannah). In the 40-100 cm layer, the soil N stocks were 2.054 and 2.245 Mg N ha-1, respectively, for natural forested savannah and Urochloa spp. pasture, and in the layer 0-100 cm they ranged from 3.273 to 3.419 Mg ha-1, respectively for Urochloa spp. pasture natural and natural forested savannah. Despite not having provoked a reduction in C and N soil stocks, the establishment of pastures in forested savannah areas show certain restraints. The removal of the original vegetation represents losses of about 49 Mg C ha-1 associated to the aboveground biomass (FERNANDES et al., 2008). This amount is greater than that stored in the soil up to 1 meter deep. When estimating the C balance for the area, such removal shall be taken into account, which will certainly contribute to obtaining unfavorable balance to the greenhouse gas emissions from the production system. Furthermore, one has to consider the costs of the clearing operation, which make this unattractive agricultural prac-tice. Currently, the trend in the Pantanal has been the introduction of exotic pastures in field areas with low nutritional quality forage. reduction in C and N soil stocks, the establishment of pastures in forested savannah areas show certain restraints.

Firstly, it is necessary to allocate large are-as to produce exclusively grain (soya/corn) as feed resources, without considering the provision of ecosystem services like more diversified agroecosystems (Power, 2010). Secondly, groundwater is usually employed at a high rate of 10L per swine (Bergier et al., 2012). Lastly, livestock industrialized wastes (basically manure, urine, hair and feed), if improperly disposed, can hazard the air (ammonia and methane emis-sions), water (ponds, streams and groundwater) and the pristine and cultivated soils (Buller, 2016). To tackle some of these issues, entre-preneurs in S\u00e3o Gabriel do Oeste (MS, Brazil) have developed a set of technologies grounded on waste biodigestion (Bergier et al., 2013). Diesel adapted machines are now able to convert calorific power of biogas into useful energy at 40% efficiency. Those biogas-driven ma-chines have been successfully employed to distribute swine digestate (effluent) in soils, particularly under pasture for cattle. We present C/N and nutrient soil data of 6 integrated swine-cattle farms in S\u00e3o Gabriel do Oeste that have been applying effluent to pasture over different time spans and variable effluent doses. The results are discussed under the light of effluent application, soil depth and time spans of effluent application.361Dynamics of C/N and nutrients in Oxisol soils treated with swine digestateMaterial and MethodsSamples of soil were gathered at different depths with a soil sampler between 22/12/2009 and 10/05/2012 in Oxisol soils under pasture of swine-cattle farms in S\u00e3o Gabriel do Oeste. The spanning time of effluent application was the basic criterion to select sampled farms. Soils assumed free of effluent in farms were also sampled as testi-mony. At the laboratory of Embrapa Pantanal, soil samples followed standard procedures for measuring carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in a CHNS Elementar, and phosphorous (P), cooper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) in an Atomic Absorption Perkin Elmer 3300.Results and ConclusionsFigure 1 shows the results in four plots. The plots 1A, 1B and 1C compare C/N with Cu, Zn and P concentrations. The y-axis of these graphs in log-scale is divided at concentration ~ 3.3 mg/kg while the x-axis is divided at C/N ~ 15.3 (means testimony bulk soil values). Data shows that soils treated with effluent between 5-30 cm depth and spanning 6 years present C/N <<15.3 and nutrient concentra-tion >>3.3 mg/kg. The plot 1D evidences that the farm spanning 6 years of effluent application largely reduce its soil C/N in compa-rison to soil testimony likely due to priming effect (Fernandes et al., 2011). However, the results indicate that swine digestate can be applied to Oxisol soils to improve its fertility without compromising C/N, particularly at deeper soil layers. The results reinforce that instead of application time span, the application dose is the main variable to be considered as the soil362Dynamics of C/N and nutrients in Oxisol soils treated with swine digestatenutrients stock is a balance between effluent input and plant absorp-tion/extraction. As a result, dosage must be carefully amended to avoid C/N reduction and soil saturation with Cu, Zn and P (and other ele-ments e.g. Na, Mg, etc.), as identified to the farm spanning 6 years of effluent application likely with high dosage rates.Figure 1.

(2012) have defined an \u2018acceptable\u2019 dosage rate of ~1 hectare of pasture for each 100 swine.

By respecting the critical dosage rate, the risk of soil nutrient saturation and C/N depletion can be minimized. State government policy of swine-cattle integration must  therefore consider adequate dosages for licensing swine intensive production in Oxisol soils. Government supervision should consider e.g. 4-year monitoring of top soil samples at 0-10 cm depth and the thresholds C/N < 12 and Cu, Zn and P > 10 mg/kg as a decision support to revoke environmental licenses to keep a better level of sustainability in swine production.ReferencesBERGIER I, MELO TJG, FRANCO E, RECH R, SILVA DS, OLIVEIRA GS, ALVES LA, MO-RAES A, KOSOSKI A, SANTOS K, BULLER LS, ORTEGA E, FERNANDES C, SILVA R, SIL-VA P, GABAS SG, LASTORIA G, MORAES O, RAMOS FM, RIBEIRO TT 2012.

Nevertheless, the process of technology development and adoption to increase the environmental behavior of production systems should considered the economic and social sustai-nability of such production systems (SILVA et al, 2016).The beef livestock production on Brazilian Amazon occur on extensive pasture mainly, as it is on the other country\u00b4s Biomas (ALVIM et al, 2015). The North Region participates with 22% of national cattle herd on 2014 (IBGE, 2016). The research aiming to understand and explain the impacts of this activity on the environment, and search mitigation alternatives technologies will develop a more environmental friendly livestock production system. The identification of Technologies and production models which allows the GEE\u00b4s reduction with good fi-nancial and social outputs.366Livestock production systems balance and the emissions intensity of Greenhouse Gas Emissions on Brazilian AmazonThis research objective is to compare the GEE\u00b4s emissions, production and economic indicators of four production systems of beef livestock on Brazilian Amazon, both single and in combination with others.Material and MethodsFour beef livestock production systems on Paragominas-PA region whe-re analyzed, two traditional systems (cow-calf (Bz_Td) and full cycle + finishing (BG_Td)) and two proposed systems, with a higher techno-logical level (cow-calf (Bz_At) and full cycle + finishing (BG_At)). The economic analyses was develop using the annual profit by the Family Income indicator (GUIDUCCI et al, 2012), and considered inputs and products prices for year 2014. The calculus of GEE\u00b4s production sys-tems used the PECUS Emissions Model version v3.9.6, developed by Pecus Project Research\u2019s team. The Model estimates the annual carbon dioxide equivalent amount and the annual beef production for each production system. Aiming a higher comprehension of the alternatives, the production systems evaluation were done one by one and on pair combinations (one cow-calf plus one full cycle + finishing). The area amount on each combination were set by the equilibrium between the supply and demand of calves on each combination,  and  the  results  were  normalized  to  one  hectare  for  easier  comparison. The inte-raction between systems could rise different and more accurate conclu-sions then the ones obtained by a single systems comparison.Results and ConclusionsThe Figure 1 shows the production system singular performance. The Family Income, beef production, supply and demand of calves is bigger on higher technological production systems than on traditional ones. However, the emission intensity behavior is not as straight as the other indicators. The higher technological cow-calf system\u00b4s emission intensity is 25% higher than from the traditional one, while the higher technological full cycle + finishing system reduces the emission inten-367Livestock production systems balance and the emissions intensity of Greenhouse Gas Emissions on Brazilian Amazonsity by 46% compared with the traditional one. The production system individual analyses, when applied to the systems considered, leads to a conclusion that the traditional cow-calf system is better than the technological one, and the opposite occurs with the full cycle + finishing systems on environmental terms. The system BG_At is the best of all four in terms of production and emission intensity, and the second on terms of Family Income.However, the full cycle + finishing production systems couldn\u00b4t exist without the cow-calf production systems, and vice versa. Therefore, the individual analyses could not be the best approach to analyze the systems efficiency. Besides, the combination of areas on each pair of systems is not the same, once the supply and demand capacity of calves on each system differs. In addition, the cow-calf sys-tems main objective is the supply of calves, and compare then by the emission intensity considering beef production could not be the best strategy.Figure 2 shows the systems combinations indicators performance. The pair\u2019s area were set by the supply and demand of calves balance, and then normalized to one hectare. The higher technological pair (Bz_At-BG_At) results on best indicators for Family Income and produc-Figure 1 \u2013 Family Income, GEE emission per area, beef production, emissions intensity, supply of calves and demand of calves for the production systems individually.Source: Research data368Livestock production systems balance and the emissions intensity of Greenhouse Gas Emissions on Brazilian Amazontivity. The intensification allows an increase on heard, thus increasing the emission by area. However, the emission intensity is the second best, being 19% less of the traditional combination adopted.The alternative systems combination adoption (Bz_At-BG_At) allows a 96% increase on Family Income, 69% increase on beef production, 37% increase on GEE\u00b4s emission by area, and a decrease of 19% on emission intensity when compared with the traditional  combination (Bz_Td-BG_Td). However, this production strategy not reach the same emission intensity obtained by the combination of traditional cow-calf system with technological full cycle + finishing production system (Bz_Td-BG_At).Those results suggests a great opportunity to technological cow-calf system development with a stronger environmental strategy, possible allowing the same Family Income and production levels, but with an overall average emission intensity below 29 kg CO2eq/Kg beef cattle.ReferencesALVIM, F.B.; SOARES-FILHO, B.S; MERRY, F.D.; AZEVEDO, H.O.;  COSTA,    W.L.S.;Figure 2 \u2013 Family Income, GEE emission per area, beef production and emis-sions intensity for the production systems combinations.Source: Research data369Livestock production systems balance and the emissions intensity of Greenhouse Gas Emissions on Brazilian AmazonCOE,  M.T.;  BATISTA,  E.L.S.;  MACIEL,   T.G.;  SHEEPERS,   L.C;   OLIVEIRA,   A.R.;RODRIGUES,H.O.

The natural vegetation includes mostly forest ecosystems from the Mata Atl\u00e2ntica, Arauc\u00e1ria Forest and Estacion\u00e1rias Forest (BEHLING et al., 2009). The biome\u2019s soil and climatic conditions allow the production of animal protein, relevant in human feeding and necessary to meet the world\u2019s demand for food and its constant gro-wth on population.Moreover, the pursuit of production processes able to decrease pos-sible environmental impacts, primarily in their initial stage, such as grain crops and pastures, as in the industrial phase, is incessant.This work had the pregnancy, calf, rearing and fattening systems as the research object, considering their high frequency in farms lo-cated in Rio Grande do Sul (SEBRAE/FARSUL/SENAR, 2005). Farming in southern Brazil is characterized by the use of natural or cultivated pastures due to suitable climatic conditions and also the small use of supplement (PAULINO; TEIXEIRA, 2009).Therefore, measuring the different system\u2019s environmental impacts is important. However, choosing a methodology to measure and 371CARBON FOOTPRINT IN DIFFERENT BEEF PROCUCTION SYSTEMS IN THE PAMPA BIOMEcharacterize these impacts is substantial for maintaining the system\u2019s sustainability and food security.In this sense, the life cycle analysis (LCA) methodology was applied with the participation of a multidisciplinary team. Hereupon, this study\u2019s goal was to analyze the beef cattle from the state of Rio Grande do Sul, where the biome Pampa prevails, using LCA on the three most widely used systems: Native Pasture (NP), Improved Native Pasture (INP) e Fertilized Native Pasture (FNP).Material and MethodsThis study analyzed the livestock production and its full cycle in the State of Rio Grande do Sul (Figure 1), consisting of the stages of pregnancy, growth, calf and steer. Rio Grande  do Sul has approximately 13,956,953 head, representing 7% of the Brazilian production (IBGE, 2012). Even though the use of Native Pasture for livestock production is significant in the region, advances in technology are responsible for the implementation of other types of pasture, increasing the stocking rate. Thus, the fertilization of native pasture and the use other species of grasses and vegetables such as ryegrass and clover, respectively, begun (GENRO et al., 2015;  RUVIARO et al., 2015;  SEBRAE/FARSUL/SENAR, 2005).The animals were Hereford breed. Also, the pregnancy and growth phases used data from Ruviaro et al. (2015), while the rearing and fattening phase used data from Genro et al. (2015). Table 1 presents the most common production systems, involving NP, INP and FNP, making a combination of these systems in 20%, 40%, 60% and 80% ratio.372CARBON FOOTPRINT IN DIFFERENT BEEF PROCUCTION SYSTEMS IN THE PAMPA BIOMEThe weight gain varied according to the diet, and each scenario determined a different final weight, being 460 kg, 450 kg and 440 kg of live weight for NP, FNP and INP, respectively (Table 2).Figure 1 - The Rio Grande do Sul Location, Source: Google Maps (2016) Table 1 - Scenario combination used to calculate the GHG  Figure 1 - The Rio rande do Sul Location, Source: Google Maps (2016)  Table 1 - Scenario combination used to calculate the GHG Scenario Productive Sistem I Native Pasture II Fertilized Native Pasture III Improved Native Pasture IV Native Pasture 80% - Fertilized Native Pasture 20% V Native Pasture 80% - Improved Native Pasture 20% VI Native Pasture 60% - Fertilized Native Pasture  40% VII Native Pasture 60% - Improved Native Pasture  40% VIII Native Pasture 40% - Fertilized Native Pasture  60% IX Native Pasture 40% - Improved Native Pasture  60% X Native Pasture 20% - Fertilized Native Pasture  80% XI Native Pasture 20% - Improved Native Pasture  80%  The weight gain varied according to the diet, and each scenario determined a different final weight, being 460 kg, 450 kg an  440 kg of live weight for NP, FNP and INP, respectively (Table 2).

BR 153 km 633, Bag\u00e9/RS. Brasil.E-mail address of presenting author*: leandro.volk@embrapa.brIntroductionThe Pampa Biome occurs in just 2.07% of Brazilian territory, but in Rio Grande do Sul state occurs in 63% (176,496 km2) of gaucho territory. Is characterized by  predomination of natural grassland with shrubs and tree vegetation in mosaic (Campos). Because of the natural grasslands, livestock production is one of the main economic activities. Natural grass ecosystems of world might be responsible for an annual sink of about 0.5 Gt carbon (Scurlock and Hall, 1998). Despite of the potential of mitigation, the society has paid attention in this livestock production system, mainly in your environmental impact. In addition to the sporadic livestock exclosure and stocking rate adjustment, other alternative practice to make more productive this livestock system (in Campos) is fertilizer application, and hibernal forages sowing (Overbeck et al, 2007; Boldrini, 2009; Nabinger et al, 2009). The ob-jective of this work was evaluating the total organic carbon stock in a Luvisol under natural grassland with different intensifications rates.Material and MethodsThe work was conducted at Embrapa Pecu\u00e1ria Sul (Bag\u00e9/RS, Brazil). The experimental area has 61 ha with 4 treatments (3 repetitions): natural grassland (CN); natural  grassland improved by fertilization (CN+A); natural grassland improved by fertilization and introduction of exotic season species ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) and 376Total organic carbon stock in Luvisol under natural grassland withdifferent intensifications in Pampa biomered clover (Trifolium pratense L.) (CN+A+F); and natural grassland with traditional management without stocking rate adjustment (CNT). The fertilization was made with 300 kg/ha of diammonium phosphate (DAP) twice a year. During all experiment time, the area was grazed by Hereford steers with forage offers of 12 kg/ 100kg of live weight. The soil is classified as a sandy clay Luvisol (Soil Taxonomy) or Luvissolo \u00d3rtico h\u00e1plico t\u00edpico (Brazilian System of Soil Classification \u2013 Em-brapa, 2006). Soil samples for physical and chemical analysis were taken off in 2015, in the 0-5 cm, 5-10 cm, 10-15 cm, 15-20 cm, 20-30 cm, 30-40 cm and 40- 50 cm layers with three replicates for each site evaluation. Soil bunk density was determined by the core me-thod. Total organic carbon was determined by following Costa et al. (2008) using a Total Organic Carbon Analyzer (Shimadzu TOC-VCSH) in Geochemistry Soil Laboratory (UFRGS). The data was assessed by one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey test (P<0.05).Results and ConclusionsThe soil bulk density did not differ significantly in none the layers of soil (Figure 1a). The 0-5 cm layer had the lowest values (1.22 g cm-3 on average) and the layer of 40-50 cm, the highest values (1.50 g cm-3 on average). The low values of soil bulk density, in the 0-5 cm and 5-10 cm layers, do not indicated soil compaction by traffic of steers, despite the larger stocking rate in the treatments CN+A and CN+A+F. Just as soil bulk density, soil organic matter did not differ in the different layers of soil (Figure 1b). The 0-5cm layer showed the highest values (3.5% on average) and the layer of 40-50 cm lower values (1.2% on average).377Total organic carbon stock in Luvisol under natural grassland withdifferent intensifications in Pampa biomeFigure 1. Soil bulk density (a) and soil organic matter (b) in a Luvisol under natural grassland with different intensifications (CNT \u2013 natural grassland with traditional management; CN \u2013 natural grassland, CN+A \u2013 natural grassland improved by fertilization; CN+A+F \u2013 natural grassland improved by fertilization and introduction of ryegrass and red clover).378Total organic carbon stock in Luvisol under natural grassland withdifferent intensifications in Pampa biomeThe differences imposed by the treatments of different intensifications (fertilization, overseeded and stocking rate) in natural grassland were not enough to cause differences between the stocks of the total soil organic carbon. Probably because the forage offers was the same for all treatments (12 kg in dry matter/100 kg of live weight).We conclude that the managements (fertilization and introduction of ryegrass and red clover) to improve productivity of cattle in natural grassland do not affect the stock of total soil carbon when the fora-ge offers is proper.ReferencesBOLDRINI, I.I.

Of the 850 million hectares (Mha) existing in the country, 200 Mha are destined for livestock (Sparovek et al., 2007).There is concern about the practice of livestock, since this type of management can liberate to the atmosphere greenhouse gases (GHGs), on the other hand, various agricultural practices are able to offset GHG emissions to the atmosphere by sequestering carbon in the atmosphere to the soil. Carbon sequestration can be achieved by the introduction of grass species, well-managed pastures and no soil disturbance, favor carbon accumulation process in the soil (Roscoe et al., 2006).One way to evaluate the carbon sequestration by the soil is the quantification of the stock and the characterization of soil organic matter (SOM). The SOM is the largest carbon reservoir of the terres-trial surface, reservoir that is dynamic and may vary with manage-ment practices. The study of humic substances (HS), which is the SOM highly decomposed, can provide information about the stability of the carbon present in this soil (Segnini, 2007).381Evaluation of the stability of soil organic matter in different types of livestock managementOne way to assess such impacts is analyzing soil organic matter (SOM). It\u2019s possible measure the changes suffered by the SOM using their fluorescence properties (Kalbitz et al., 1999).Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the amount of carbon pre-sent in humic acid (HA) and check the humification indices thereof in different types of livestock management.Material and MethodsTo attain the proposed objectives humic acids of five areas of diffe-rent pastures were extracted. Table 1 details the characteristics of the five areas evaluated. The experimental area is located in the city of S\u00e3o Carlos, SP, BrazilTable 1. Description of the samples about of kind management, texture and stocking.Experimental area management texture stocking rateArea 1 irrigated medium sandy highArea 2 dry loamy highArea 3 in recovery loamy mediumArea 4 degraded medium sandy shortArea 5 native forest medium withoutThe sampling was conducted in 8 depths (0-5, 5-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40, 40-60,  60-80 and 80-100 cm) for each area, totaling 40 samples soil. The extraction and purification of humic acids of soil followed the recommendations described by Swift (1996) and the International Humic Substances Society (IHSS).382Evaluation of the stability of soil organic matter in different types of livestock managementThe fraction of humic substances used for the analysis was the humic acid. Was used an elemental analyzer (CHNS) Perkin-Elmer (2400 Serious II CHNS/O Elemental Analyzer) model, to determine the humi-fication index was used luminescence spectrometer  Perkin Elmer LS--50B model and the indexes were calculated according to the method proposed by Milori et al., 2002.Results and ConclusionsThe average values of carbon for each area evaluated are shown in figure 1.Figure 1.

This behavior in degraded area suggests the presence of a SOM which is already more humified in the whole soil profile. For the other areas, it can be said that still have a fresher SOM in surface. Were evaluated the carbon content of the whole soil in the same samples from this study, and lower carbon content was found for the degraded area, thus indicating that pasture degradation leads to loss of carbon to the atmosphere (Segnini et al. , 2014).   The humification indexes are in Figure 2. The values of humification indexes increase with increasing depth for all evaluated areas.   Figure 2. Humification indexes obtained by Milori et al., 2002.

Already the native forest has the smallest humification values in almost all depths. The irrigated area has higher values of the humification index in the intermediary of the soil profile horizons, between 20 to 40 cm. The dry areas and recovery have similar behavior, both increase the values of the humification index in the deeper horizons. The degraded area has the highest values of humification indexes, along with the higher carbon values, thus suggesting the presence of a SOM most recalcitrant, which in turn will not easily interact with the soil, leaving the soil more depleted and less fertile. Already the native forest showed lowest values of humification indexes in this area there is a more labile organic material, that is, the SOM is subject to more interactions with the soil compartments, resulting in a more fertile soil.  Although this study is very preliminary to effective analysis of pasture management, the results showed a coherence between the fluorescence results with carbon content. To make a more accurate assessment about carbon cycling and effective recommendation on pasture management, you need to relate the results with other soil parameters such as physical parameters, and thus can establish a management that allows a carbon stability in the soil.

Agricultural soils can act as a source or as a sink of greenhouse gases (GHG), depending on the management system that are submitted (IPCC, 2001). Management systems that increase the addition of vegetable wastes and retention of soil C constitute important alternatives to increase the drain capacity C-CO2 atmospheric and GHG mitigation, contributing to the efforts to avoid global warming (Bayer et al., 2006).The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of pasture management on the soil C stocks, focusing on the sustainability of livestock farming in Brazil. Carbon stocks and C accumulation rates were compared in the surface (0-30 cm) and in deeper layers (30-100 cm) of soil, having a native forest as reference.386Soil carbon content and stock in tropical pastures in a milk production systemMaterial and MethodsThe study was carried out at Embrapa Pecu\u00e1ria Sudeste, S\u00e3o Paulo state, Brazil. Soil C was evaluated in pastures under two types of management in a milk production sytem in a dystrophic Red yellow Latossol (Oxisol): EXT - extensive with low stocking rate; IIR - intensively managed and irrigated with high stocking rate. The EXT pasture was composed of two  paddocks  (bloks),  3.0  ha  each,  containing  Brachiaria  spp.   and   Cynodon nlemfuensis Vanderyst, managed as continuous grazing systems, without  fertilization. Pastures in IIR system were stablished with Panicum maximum Jacq cv. Tanz\u00e2nia and overseeded  with  Avena  byzantina  cv.  S\u00e3o  Carlos  and  Loliun  multifloram  Lan.  cv.  BRS Ponteio, in autumn. The IIR system consisted of two similar 1.6 ha rotational systems, divided in 27 paddocks with 600 m2 each, intermittently grazed, with a day of occupation and 26 days of rest. The intensive managed pastures were limed and fertilized with superphosphate and potassium chloride to achieve respectively, 20 mg P.dm-3 and 4% K in soil CTC - cation exchange capacity. Nitrogen was applied at the rate of 600 kg ha-1year-1. Cows grazing all pastures received a dietary supplement (concentrate) formulated according to the NRC (2001) in the rate of 1 kg of concentrate per 3 kg of milk produced. All grazing systems were submitted to stocking rate adjustments using the \u201cput and take\u201d technique (Mott and Lucas, 1952) and visual evaluation of forage availability.Soil samples were collected in different depths: 0-5, 5-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40, 40-60, 60-80 and 80-100 cm; with six replicates (three replicates/block) and two cores from each field replicate. Samples from each depth interval were collected using an aluminum ring of known volume and pooled for the subsequent evaluation of dry soil weight (105 \u00baC). Individual soil samples were air-dried and ground in a mortar to pass a 0.150 mm sieve. Carbon concentration was analyzed using CHN equipment. Carbon stock (Mg ha-1) of each sample was calculated and corrected to an equivalent mass depth (Ellert 387Soil carbon content and stock in tropical pastures in a milk production systemand Bettany, 1996), using the native forest (Atlantic Forest) soil as reference. In addition, C accumulation rates in the 0-30 and 0-100 cm soil layers of each pasture were calculated. Data were analyzed by the SAS\u00ae (SAS Institute, 2002) program, using the Mixed Procedure.ResultsThe type of pasture and the soil layer affected the C concentration (%) in the soils (Table 1). The concentration of soil carbon was higher in EXT, compared to IIR and the forest (FOR) which had similar concen-trations. Carbon concentration was higher in the first layer (0-5 cm) of soil, decreasing as the depth increased. There was a pasture/soil layer interaction only for the depth of 0-5 cm, in which soil C concen-tration was higher in EXT (4.47%) than in IRR and FOR pastures (2.37 and 2.24%, respectively).The type of grazing system did not affect the C stock variable. The soil layer influenced that variable. Carbon stock in the 0-100 cm layer was 121% higher than in the 0-30 cm layer, Sthal, et al. (2016) indicating that carbon stocks should be considered in layers as deep as 100 cm.ConclusionsSoil in pastures under extensive management may have higher C concentration than soils in intensively managed pastures and in tropical forests but C stocks may not differ between these areas.

All grazing systems were submitted to stocking rate adjustments using the \"put and take\" technique (Mott and Lucas, 1952) and visual evaluation of forage availability.  Soil samples were collected in different depths: 0-5, 5-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40, 40-60, 60-80 and 80-100 cm; with six replicates (three replicates/block) and two cores from each field replicate. Samples from each depth interval were collected using an aluminum ring of known volume and pooled for the subsequent evaluation of dry soil weight (105 \u00baC). Individual soil samples were air-dried and ground in a mortar to pass a 0.150 mm sieve. Carbon concentration was analyzed using CHN equipment. Carbon stock (Mg ha-1) of each sample was calculated and corrected to an equivalent mass depth (Ellert and Bettany, 1996), using the native forest (Atlantic Forest) soil as reference. In addition, C accumulation rates in the 0-30 and 0-100 cm soil layers of each pasture were calculated. Data were analyzed by the SAS\u00ae (SAS Institute, 2002) program, using the Mixed Procedure.  Results  The type of pasture and the soil layer affected the C concentration (%) in the soils (Table 1). The concentration of oil carbon was higher in EXT, compared to IIR and the forest (FOR) which had similar concentrations. Carbon concentration was higher in the first layer (0-5 cm) of soil, decreasing as the depth i creased. There was a pasture/soil layer interaction only for the depth of 0-5 cm, in which soil C concentration was higher in EXT (4.47%) than in IRR and FOR pastures (2.37 and 2.24%, respectively). The type of grazing system did not affect the C stock variable. The soil layer influenced that variable. Carbon stock in the 0-100 cm layer was 121% higher than in the 0-30 cm layer, Sthal, et al. (2016) indicating that carbon stocks should be considered in layers as deep as 100 cm.  Table1.

In the past 50 years, this region underwent an intense process of soil use change, thus studies investigating the carbon dynamics in agricultural and livestock production systems in the Amazon are of key importance.It is observed that, in the current food production scenario, there are increasingly more public policies that foster agricultural and livestock activities than towards high-production systems that also promote en-vironmental gains (Salton et al., 2011; Carvalho et al., 2014a).This research aimed to investigate the dynamics of the soil carbon con-tent in a native forest \u2013 poorly managed pasture \u2013 silvopastoral system chronosequence.Material and MethodsThe areas studied are located at Vit\u00f3ria Farm in Paragominas,  state of  390Assessment of soil carbon content in pastures with different managementsPar\u00e1, Brazil. The farm was established in the late 1960s, when part of the native forest was removed for the implementation of homogeneous pastures. By the 1990s, those pastures were suffering from agricul-tural degradation process (high infestation by weeds) and, in 2009, the area was overhauled, when the silvopastoral system was implemented in part of the land. The silvopastoral system is made up of the tree species Schizolobium amazonicum (Paric\u00e1) and by the forage grass Brachiaria brizantha cv piat\u00e3. Between 2009 and 2012, crop rotation with Zea mays x forage grass was performed in the system following guidelines of the no-tillage system.The soil in the area is classified as high-clay dystrophic yellow latosol. The chronosequence investigated was as follows: remaining native forest (collection in 1992 by Camargo et al., 1997), pasture under agricultural degradation (collection in 1992 by Camargo et al., 1997), and pasture under silvopastoral system (collection in 2013).Soil was collected from layers 0-10, 10-20, and 20-30 cm deep with three repetitions and the sites were selected away from the zone of interference of the trees\u2019 root system. The soil carbon content was assessed in a Carlo Erba elemental analyzer. Results were evalua-ted considering the different soil use systems and soil layers, through variance  analysis (ANOVA) and mean comparison test Tukey at 5% probability, using the software SAS.391Assessment of soil carbon content in pastures with different managementsResults and ConclusionsWhen the degraded pasture (DP) area was compared to native forest (initial reference), significant carbon loss was found in the DP area due to poor management (Table 1). The carbon content in the 0-10 cm--deep-layer was statistically different between the silvopastoral sys-tem (SP) and the DP (Table 1). In the 10-30 cm-deep range, the results of the same systems were statistically similar, however, the SP system had higher absolute values than the DP.Table 1. Mean C content (g kg-1) in different soil management systems at Vit\u00f3ria Farm (Paragominas, PA, Brazil) between 1992 and 2013 Results and Conclusions When the degraded pasture (DP) area was compared to native forest (initial reference), significant carbon loss was found in the DP area due to poor management (Table 1). The carbon content in the 0-10 cm-deep-layer was statistically different between the silvopastoral system (SP) and the DP (Table 1).

It is inferred that the pasture overhaul with soil fertility correction, adequation of the stocking rate, and incorporation of no-tillage planting for growing corn x forage grass (for three harvests) impacted the increase in soil carbon content in the area studied. It is important to point out that the integrated cultivation systems in no-tillage planting on straw leads to a greater increase in organic matter, which also benefits the soil\u2019s physical structure and favors the establishment of roots and water infiltration into the soil (Martorano et al., 2009). Carvalho et al. (2014b), in a similar study, identified greater carbon stock in a crop-livestock area compared to a poorly managed homogenous pasture. Besides the benefits of the production system, agriculture and livestock integration systems also have the potential to control greenhouse gas emission from farming and ranching. According to Silva et al. (2014), the crop-livestock integration system can potentially act as a CO2 sinkhole as long as the grazing intensity is correct. In turn, Salton et al. (2014) identified that the crop-livestock integration system had better productivity and environmental efficiency. Those authors also report that the system is recommended for the different regions of Brazil.  Overall, it was found that pasture overhaul and responsible management led to an increase in carbon content in the area. Therefore, multiplying information on effective soil management systems, as is the case observed at Vit\u00f3ria Farm in Paragominas, PA, Brazil, becomes necessary.   References   AGUIAR, A. P.

Email address of presenting author *: jair.santos@embrapa.br.IntroductionThe debate on the relationship between human activities and the growth in the emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) into the atmosphere has brought the need to study more deeply the relationship between productive activities and the emission of these greenhouse gases (GHG) (FAO, 2013). Thus, the definition of what changes should be implemented in the production process aiming to reduce GHG emissions level should also consider the economic and social sustainability of the activity (SILVA et al, 2016).Beef cattle in Amazon, as in most of Brazil, is also predominantly developed in an extensive manner (ALVIM et al, 2015). The North Region had in 2014 a cattle herd of 45,826,142 beef heads, which represented 22% of the whole national herd, with emphasis to State of Par\u00e1 with 19,911,217 - 43% of the regional cattle (IBGE, 2016). The study on the effects of this activity on the environment and the search for alternatives to mitigate the negative impacts will enable the development of more sustainable livestock. The increase in the adoption of more sustainable livestock systems, especially from an environmental point of view depends on the establishment of incentives to producers and, therefore, it is essential to identify models which present these virtuous characteristics, as well as economic performance, in order to define strategies for this combination.395Tradeoff between profitability and GHG emissions by beef cattle systems in Brazilian AmazonThe analysis of the tradeoff between profitability and GHG emissions in agricultural systems can be used to reconcile economic performance and environmental performance at a given productive context, given the scarcity of resources and the need of making decisions about their use. This way, various scenarios can be simulated, in which the comparison between the economic and environmental performance of productive activities provides information for the definition of actions that seek to achieve the sustainability that embraces economic and environmental indicators (STOORVOGEL et al., 2004).This work aims to show comparatively the performance of economic profitability indicators and GHG emissions in the development of beef cattle activity in the Amazon, having as reference two types of produc-tion systems and two level of technology adopted in the State of Par\u00e1, which are located in the middle region Southeast Par\u00e1 and micro region Paragominas, within the context of studies conducted by PECUS Network - Greenhouse gases (GHG) dynamics in Brazilian livestock production systems.Material and MethodsFour production systems in the micro region of Paragominas were eva-luated, two systems considered modal and classified as traditional and two considered as alternative and with greater use of technology in the year 2014. Two models had as goal the production of calves (one traditional and other alternative) and the other two the production of live cattle, also with the two aspects. The economic evaluation was performed through the cost-benefit analysis and in accordance with the methodology shown in Guiducci et al. (2012), using as indicators, among others, the net income and the family income. It was con-sidered the prices of inputs and products for the year 2014. For the calculation of GHG emissions it was used the Model Emissions PECUS v3.9.6 developed by the PECUS project team, with estimation of emission of GEE (CH4 + CO2 + N2O converted for equivalent CO2) as environmental indicator.396Tradeoff between profitability and GHG emissions by beef cattle systems in Brazilian AmazonFor comparison between the economic and environmental performance of systems, jointly, it was used the tradeoff method, which portrays the idea of compensatory exchanges between performances.Results and ConclusionsThe results presented here consider only the indicators \u201cfamily income\u201d as indicator of profitability and the \u201cemission of GEE,\u201d as proxies for economic and environmental performance, respectively.Figure 1 shows the relationships between economic and environmental performance for each of the evaluated systems. In Figure 1a, it was considered emissions per unit of area (viewpoint of farmers), the Calf Alternative System, for example, with the highest economic perfor-mance (higher profitability per hectare) and, on the other hand, the lowest environmental performance (lower rate of emission, i.e. greater volume of emission). At the other end, we see the Traditional Calf and the Fat Cattle Traditional systems with higher environmental performance but with lower economic performance. Similarly, it is established that the alternative systems presented higher economic performance and lower environmental performance while the reverse occurs with traditional systems.However, Figure 1b, which considers emissions per unit of area (view- use of technology in the year 2014.

From that, it is inferred the need of establishing compensatory measures to encourage the adoption of more appropriate systems in environmental terms, assuming that the economic performance is determining factor for the decision-making of producers concerning adoption of the kind of system. As a suggestion for new researches, there is the need for quantification of the compensatory measures to be adopted, aiming at the balance of costs and social benefits resulting of such measures, represented by the valuation of the tradeoffs between economic and environmental performanceReferencesALVIM, F.B.; SOARES-FILHO, B.S; MERRY, F.D.; AZEVEDO, H.O.; COSTA, W.L.S.; COE,  M.T.;  BATISTA,  E.L.S.;  MACIEL,  T.G.;  SHEEPERS,  L.C;  OLIVEIRA,      A.R.; RODRIGUES,H.O.

Box 3037, Lavras, MG, Brazil,*joaocesar.resende@embrapa.brIntroductionMilk production systems in Brazil are very heterogeneous regarding the use of production technology. In general, the technology used in a farm reflects both physical productivity of factors used and the economic results of the production process. In the case of physical productivity, three indicators may be used to compare the effect of the technological profile of differences between farms: animal productivity, labor productivity and the productivity of the land. Productivity gains are expected in these three indicators when intensifying production technology. The same should occur in a positive way with economic performance indicators. Otherwise, the technology is being applied properly in the productive process.The present study aimed to evaluate the impact of technology of these indicators in milk- producing farms seeking to guide studies of mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions in dairy farming.Material and MethodsTo perform this study three typical farms of milk production was selected by extension workers of Emater/Paran\u00e1, specialists in dairy farms. The selection of the farms followed an approach known as Typical Farm Approach or Reference Production Systems (Hemme et 400Indicators of technological levels in milk production farms and impact onproductivity of the factorsal., 2015), methodology adopted by Embrapa to conduct socio-eco-nomic research on milk production farms (Stock & Carneiro, 2008; Stock et. al., 2008).The farms are located in the Northwest of Paran\u00e1, in the municipality of S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 da Boa Vista and represent three different technological profiles of dairy farms in that region: low, medium and high technology. Economics and technical coefficients was collect to represent each technology with the support of extension workers.The estimation and analysis of costs and profitability of farms followed the standard methodology (Guiducci et al., 2012) adopted by the network of Pecus team. Three variables were chosen to indicate the technological level of the farms: area of land used for the dairy activity, amount of adult cows present in the herd and daily milk production. Two other indicators were chosen to represent the technological level: capital investment in the dairy activity and expenditure on feed concentrates. The productivity of the factors was indicated by the milk yield per cow, per acreage unit and per worker on the farm. The profitability indicators were the direct expenses per liter of milk produced and family income per acreage. The three farms were coded as S1, S2 and S3 according to the technological level represented respectively by low, medium and high.401Indicators of technological levels in milk production farms and impact onproductivity of the factorsResults and ConclusionsBy compering those farms with typical dairy farms in other Brazilian States (Minas Gerais and Goi\u00e1s, for example) the farms are not consi-dered large in terms of acreage. However, they are representative in terms of land use that prevails in the Southern of Brazil.The milk production per farm is higher than the average of production observed in other regions of the country as well as the yield per cow. The farm selected to represent the low technology system (S1) had a yield per cow of 17.1 liters, which is also higher than the national average of 4.3 liters/day, in 2014. The indicator varia-bles of productivity and profitability factors, in general, showed an expected consistency (table 1).Table 1.

By analyzing the farms from low to high technologies, the variables investment and yield per cow clearly showed a trend in the same direction, i. e. the higher the investment in the dairy activity the higher the animal yield. Similarly, if considered the costs of feed (variable \"expenditure on concentrated feed\") as an indicator of technology and comparing with the animal productivity, a consistent path between the two variables is observed as well.  Labor productivity was another indicator consistently impacted by investment in the dairy activity and expenditure on concentrated feed. The productivity of land was similar in the farms of medium and high technologies (S2 and S3). However, by comparison both S1 and S2 with the low\u00adtech farm (S1) it can be observed that the impact was significant and consistent in this productivity factor. The profitability indicators showed that medium\u00adand high\u00adtech farms produced more family income per acreage than the low\u00adprofile technological farm. On the other hand, the expenses were similar in the two farms of lower technology (S1 and S2), but higher in the S3 farm. This seems an expected behavior, considering the hypothesis that farms with higher technology are also those that present higher production scale (milk production in the case). However, they increase the total income from the farm to the extent that technological investments increase the scale of production. In this case, then, lower margin provides more total income resulting from the increased scale of production. The increase of operating capital (variable \u201ctotal investment in the dairy activity\u201d), represented by investments in land, herd, machinery and equipm nt, agreed with the expansion of productivity, especially animal ield.By analyzing the farms from low to high technologies, the variables investment and yield per cow clearly showed a trend in the same di-rection, i. e. the higher the investment in the dairy activity the higher 402Indicators of technological levels in milk production farms and impact onproductivity of the factorsthe animal yield. Similarly, if considered the costs of feed (variable \u201cexpenditure on concentrated feed\u201d) as an indicator of technolo-gy and comparing with the animal productivity, a consistent path between the two variables is observed as well.Labor productivity was another indicator consistently impacted by investment in the dairy activity and expenditure on concentrated feed. The productivity of land was similar in the farms of medium and high technologies (S2 and S3). However, by comparison both S1 and S2 with the low-tech farm (S1) it can be observed that the impact was significant and consistent in this productivity factor. The profita-bility indicators showed that medium-and high-tech farms produced more family income per acreage than the low-profile technological farm. On the other hand, the expenses were similar in the two farms of lower technology (S1 and S2), but higher in the S3 farm. This seems an expected behavior, considering the hypothesis that farms with higher technology are also those that present higher produc-tion scale (milk production in the case). However, they increase the total income from the farm to the extent that technological invest-ments increase the scale of production. In this case, then, lower margin provides more total income resulting from the increased scale of production.This exploratory study found that stepping up technological indica-tors lined up with gains in productivity indicators and total profitabi-lity in milk-producing farms. The gain of scale, as expected, seems to be an important strategy to increase the total profitability of the dairy activity, although the net margin from each unit produced has been descending with technological intensification. Studies with a larger sample of farms with similar production system may confirm this statement.For further research in this direction, other quantitative and quali-tative indicators of technical and economic performance could be considered, making possible to use the data in simulations and com-plementary sensitivity analysis and greenhouse gas mitigation.403Indicators of technological levels in milk production farms and impact onproductivity of the factorsReferencesGUIDUCCI,  R.C.N,  ALVES,  E.R.A,  LIMA  FILHO,  J.R.,  MOTA,  M.M.

The objective of this study was to show the variability of beef cattle in the country, grouping producers into homo-geneous groups according to their production characteristics. Knowing these groups  and the differences among them is essential for resear-ch, development, technology transfer and appropriate public policies.Material and MethodsSpecial tabulations were performed by IBGE to meet the objectives of the study. Data from holdings in the Agricultural Census 2006 were fil-tered for holdings with beef cattle herd of over 500 heads for the Pan-tanal and over 200 heads for all other biomes. The selected data used for the analysis cover a large proportion of the national beef herd, including 88% of the \u201cCerrado\u201d, 86% of the \u201cAmaz\u00f4nia\u201d, 77% of the \u201cMata Atl\u00e2ntica\u201d, 82% of the \u201cPampa\u201d and 95% of the \u201cPantanal\u201d.405Typifying beef cattle producers in Brazilian biomesFifteen variables from Census questionnaire were created covering the following production aspects for each holding: main activity (cow-calf, stocker, finishing and combinations); technological and intensification levels (stocking rate, natural and sown pastures, fertilization of pas-tures, use of concentrated feed, feedlot, insemination and technical assistance); degree of diversification (percentage of the holding used land area allocated to pastures, crops, planted forests and agrofores-try systems); economic importance of beef cattle (share of the total production value) and herd size (live weight). The holding used land area was defined as the sum of areas for crops (temporary and per-manent), pastures (natural and sown), planted forests and agroforestry systems. In some cases, other variables were added to represent a biome specific characteristic.Factor analysis was applied to the variables selected in order to identify unobservable factors that represented the diverse characteristics of producers from each biome. Then, the factors with the most signi-ficant contributions to explain the total variability of the information were used as the classification criteria of producers in relatively homo-geneous groups by cluster analysis.Results and ConclusionsThe clusters found for beef cattle producers in each biome are described below.Cerrado: In 2006, 33% of Brazilian beef cattle holdings were in the Cerrado biome, occupying 43% of the Brazilian area of pastures with 40% of the Brazilian beef cattle. Six groups were identified, four of them specialized in beef cattle with the following characteristics: i) holdings with a full cycle on grass, with some sale of calves and steers and intermediate technological level (46% of the holdings, 43% of the pasture area and 42% of the herd of this biome); ii) holdings with predominance of stocker and finishing phases on grass, low technological level (25% of holdings, 20% of the pasture area and 406Typifying beef cattle producers in Brazilian biomes19% of the herd); iii) mostly holdings for cow-calf, low technological level (16% of holdings, 13% of pasture area, 11% of the herd); iv) large holdings for full cycle process on grass, with higher technological level (5% of the holdings, 20% of pasture area, 22% of the herd). The holdings non- specialized in beef cattle (full cycle production) shared their area between grass and crops or forestry, accounting for just over 8% of the holdings, 4% of the pasture area and 6% of the herd.Pantanal: The Pantanal was responsible for 1% of Brazilian holdings for beef cattle, 7% of the pasture area and 3% of the herd, according to the 2006 Census. Seven groups were found, two of them dedicated to extensive cow-calf and stocker, representing together 66% of the holdings, 64% of pasture area and 52% of the herd. Three groups were identified as full cycle holdings and showed marked technological gradient, especially in regard to pasture management: i) large extensive holdings, with a predominance of natural pasture and some sown pastures, but without the use of fertilizers (7% of the holdings, 21% of the of pasture area, 29% of the herd); ii) holdings with predominance of sown pasture not degraded and fertilizer use (3% of holdings, 2% of the pasture area and 3% of the herd); iii)  smaller holdings that combine a full cycle production with crops, forests and agroforestry systems (2% of holdings, less than 1% of the pasture area and 1% of the herd). There  was also holdings dedicated to stocker-finishing and finishing on grass that accounted for 20% of the holdings, 12% of the pasture area, and 14% of the herd. The presence of stocker and finishing or full cycle beef systems in the Pantanal is linked to higher elevation areas (the \u201cPantanal plateau\u201d), which concentrate the sown pastures, most of which is in transition zones for the Cerrado. Analysis of geomorphology (ASSINE et al., 2015) and vegetation (SILVA et al., 2007) maps combined with the IBGE\u2019s map of the Pantanal biome supported the results of the typology.Amaz\u00f4nia: This biome holds 25% of beef cattle holdings, which held 24% of the pasture area and 28% of the herd for this activity in 2006. For this biome six groups were considered representative: i) low-tech 407Typifying beef cattle producers in Brazilian biomesholdings dedicated to full cycle with some selling of calves (61% of the holdings, 60% of the pasture area and 60% of the herd); ii) low-tech holdings for finishing on grass (19% of the holdings, 18% of the pasture area and 14% of the herd); iii) full cycle production on holdings with diversified production, areas of equivalent size for crops and pastures, with the presence of planted forests and agroforestry systems (7% of the holdings, 3% of the pasture area and 5% of herd); iv) full cycle, low technology, smaller herd (9% of the holdings, 6% of the pasture area and 6% of the herd); v) full cycle with higher technological level, especially fertilization of pastures and technical guidance of producers (5% of the holdings, 10% of the pasture area and 10% of the herd; and vi) large holdings with intermediate technology, full cycle, buying calves (0.2% of the holdings, 4% of the pasture area and 5% of the herd).Mata Atl\u00e2ntica: This biome holds 29% of the holdings, 16% of the pasture area and 21% of the Brazilian herd in 2006. Seven groups were found: i) full cycle on grass, lower technology (34% of the hol-dings, 39% of the pasture area and 37% of the herd); ii) full cycle on grass with higher technological level and larger herds (5% of the holdings, 14% of the pasture area and 15% of the herd); iii) holdin-gs with full cycle and diversified  production,  combining crops and beef cattle (12% of the holdings, 6% of the pasture area and 9% of the herd); iv) holdings with diversified production combining planted forests and the full cycle (0.5% of the holdings, 0.3% of the pasture area and 0.4% of the herd); v) cow-calf and stocker production syste-ms, lower technological level (22% of the holdings, 18% of the pastu-re area and 16% of the herd); vi) low-tech finishing systems on grass (24% of holdings, 22% of the pasture area and 20% of the herd); vii) finishing with feedlot (3% of the holdings, 2% of the pasture area and 3% of the herd).Pampa: The Pampa represented 6% of the holdings, 6% of the pasture area and 5% of the Brazilian beef cattle herd in 2006. All the groups for this biome included the presence of crops, characteristic of 408Typifying beef cattle producers in Brazilian biomesproduction systems of this biome. On average, 13% of the areas were designed to crops. Three groups were more representative, all with a predominance of natural pasture and total area of pasture about 90% of the holding used land area: i) full cycle on grass, with intermediate technology (41% of the holdings, 52% of the pasture area and 52% of the herd); ii) low-tech holdings for cow-calf and cow-calf - stocker on grass (25% of the holdings, 23% of the pasture area and 22% of the herd); iii) finishing on pasture, low-tech (15% of holdings, 13% of pasture area and 11% of the herd). A fourth group (full cycle and finishing) presented crop area similar to pasture area (46% and 48% of the holding used land area, respectively) and better technological level compared to the groups above (12% of the holdings, 7% of the pas-ture area and 9% of the herd). Three smaller groups had the highest technological levels: i) holdings with full cycle and diversified produc-tion, with crops, planted forests and agroforestry systems (2% of the holdings, 2% of the pasture area and 2% of the herd); ii) finishing with feedlot (2% of the holdings, 1% of the pasture area and 2% of the herd); and iii) production of full cycle with a significant presence of fodder for cutting (2% of holdings, 0.5% of the pasture area and 1% of the herd). The last group was composed by holdings performing full cycle with degraded pastures that would require greater efforts for fertilization (1% of the holdings, 1% of the pasture area and 1% of the herd).Experts considered that this typology represented the Brazilian beef cattle production systems appropriately.ReferencesIBGE.

Starting in the last decade, studies and debates about the contribution of beef cattle production to greenhouse gases have intensified, mobilized by different institutions; among them, universities, farmers associations, public figures, the media in general, as well as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Some recent studies have demonstrated that higher or lower methane production depends fundamentally on the conditions of the production system (Genro et al., 2014; Moscat,  2015).In addition, the interest sparked by this topic has fostered the necessity for mitigation systems evaluations that integrate economic and environmental  performance.  These evaluations have the goal of determining if systems that are capable of mitigating the emission of greenhouse gases are also economically feasible. The tools and strategies that are expected to be utilized by producers should be economically sustainable, otherwise, they run the risk of not being implemented (Berndt,  2010).411Changes in the economic and environmental performance assessment of beef cattleproduction systems on natural grassland in southern BrazilThe objective of this study was to analyze the economic and environmental performance of pasture production systems with different levels of intensification in backgrounding and finishing cattle in southern Brazil in 2015 and 2016. This information will be able to provide important guidelines for farmers making decisions on greenhouse gas mitigation systems and understand its evolution over  time.Material and MethodsThe experiment was conducted in an area belonging to  Embrapa  South  Livestock, located in Bag\u00e9, Rio Grande do Sul--under the purview of Pecus Network-- during 2013. Economic analysis used current (May 2015) fat cattle prices (R$ 5,40 kg LW-1 and costs. Nine paddocks , approximately seven hectares in size, located in a grassland area were used. Three paddocks were assigned to each of three treatments: natural grassland  field  (NG); natural grassland with nitrogen fertilizer (NGF); natural grassland with nitrogen fertilizer and overseeding of two hibernal species: ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) and red clover (Trifolium pratense) (NGFS). In all the treatments, the pasture was managed in order to maintain the fodder supply at 12% (12 kg of dry matter/100 kg live weight). For this, three Hereford steers were used in each paddock, where methane emission evaluations were conducted.  In addition, sufficient animals were used to maintain the forage supply at 12%. The average annual capacity of the paddock,  including the regulator animals,  was  nine animals  (NG),    12 animals (NGF) and 13 animals (NGFS). Methane emissions by the animals were measured using the sulphur hexaflouride marker technique, over a five day period, in all seasons of the year (starting on January 21, June 5, July 22, and October 28). Methane samples were collected in the proximity of the animals\u2019 noses with the assistance of regulatory air intake valves, and stored in stainless steel tubes. Data relative to pasture management and animal health conditions were collected in the same fashion during the experimental period.

There was an increase in economic return per hectare with fertilization and enhancement of natural grassland as compared to NG. The relation between financial benefit and the emission of one kg of methane is better to NGFS. If a farmer sought the same profit, but decided not to invest in increasing productivity, on average, this decision would double the amount of methane emissions for the same meat production. It should be noted that the advantages of intensification may be even greater when the soil carbon balance is considered in the economic analyses (Berndt, 2010). However, due to rising costs although there was an increase in prices received by producers the advantage of NGF and NGFS systems  decreasedThe use of fertilization and the introduction of hibernal species to native grasslands has been shown to be sustainable both in terms of methane  emission per  kilo  of live weight,  as well as in productive and economic terms per hectare and in terms of the cost/benefit re-lation of emissions. However, an important research topic is to unders-tand how is the relationship between prices received and prices paid by producers and emissions in different  systems. Perhaps there is a limit, a relationship between inputs and products that stimulate or not to intensify systems.ReferencesBERNDT, Alexandre. 2010.

The total cumulative annual N2O emission from grazing systems was higher in ICLF, followed by ICL, CER and CPWF. The lower emission in CPWF may be related to the non-supply of nitrogen fertilization in this system. For CH4, ICL has the system with higher emission, which may be associated with higher soil moisture content, when compared to CPWF and ICLF systems, and CER. The CO2 emissions were higher for ICL, followed by ICLF and CPWF, and smaller in CER, probably due to greater natural stabilization of the carbon in this system. Higher emissions of CO2 in ICL may represent a higher flow in the dynamics of soil organic matter, and not necessarily loss of soil carbon.Acknowledgements \u2013 EMBRAPA, FUNDECT, CNPq. Table 1.

Suggestions  to reduce CH4 emissions per area include the adoption of cultivated pastures and the improvement of native pastures, increasing the carrying capacity of grazing areas with the consequent increase of stocking rates and productivity in animal production systems (Oliveira et al., 2015).Therefore, the aim of this study was to estimate CH4 emissions per ha from Holstein and Holstein/Jersey lactating dairy cows in two grazing systems..421Methane emissions per area from Holstein and Holstein/Jersey dairy cows in two different grazing systems \u2013preliminary resultsMaterial and MethodsThe experiment was conducted at Embrapa Southeast Livestock, using 24 lactating dairy cows (12Holstein and 12Jersey-Holstein cross) in a 2 x 2 factorial design with two pasture systems: extensive with low stocking rate - EXT - and intensively managed and irrigated with high stocking rate - IIR. Evaluations were carried out during the total lactation period of the cows (270 d).Cows received a dietary supplement formulated according to the NRC (2001), in a rate of 1 kg of concentrate per 3 kg of milk produced. The EXT system consisted of two paddocks of 3.0 ha each, containing a misture of Brachiaria spp. and Cynodon nlemfuensis Vanderyst, managed as continuous grazing systems. The IIR system was cultivated with Panicum maximum Jacq cv. Tanz\u00e2nia and overseeded with Avena byzantina cv. S\u00e3o Carlos and Loliun multifloram Lan. cv. BRS Ponteio, in autumn. The IIR system consisted of two similar 1.6 ha areas managed as rotational grazing systems. Each area was divided in 27 padocks, with 600 m2  each, intermittently grazed, with a day of occupation and 26 days of rest.All of the grazing systems were submitted to stocking rate adjust-ments using the \u201cput and take\u201d technique (Mott and Lucas, 1952) and visual evaluation of forage availability.The sulfur hexafluoride tracer technique, as described by K. A. Johnson and D. E. Johnson (1995), adapted by Primavesi et al. (2004) and improved by Berndt et al. (2014), was used for determination of enteric methane from the cows,. Measurements were performed three times during the lactating period (in winter, spring and summer).Total CH4 emissions were calculated per hectare (kg CH4 ha-1 per 270 d lactation), according to genotypes and grazing system. The CH4 emission factors for total milk yield (MY) and 3.5% fat corrected milk 422Methane emissions per area from Holstein and Holstein/Jersey dairy cows in two different grazing systems \u2013preliminary results(FCM) per ha were calculated by dividing the total CH4 emission per ha by MY and FCM, respectively.   Data were analyzed by the SAS\u00ae  (SAS Institute, 2002) program, using Mixed Procedure.ResultsAnnual average stocking rates were 1.9 and 2.1 animals ha-1 in EXT and 6.6 and 7.9 animals ha-1 in IIR, for Holstein and Jersey-Holstein breeds, respectively. Milk yield did not differ between breeds (mean of 34.7 kg d-1). Total methane emission per ha was higher in IIR (379.4 kg ha-1) compared to EXT (97.7 kg ha-1) (P<0.0001), however, CH4 emissions per milk yield (mean of 18.0 g kg MY-1) ) and fat corrected milk production (mean of 18.8 g kg FCM-1) ), did not differ between the grazing systems. The CH4 emissions per hectare (kg ha-1) were not affected by genotype (P=0.2160). However, Jersey-Holstein cows emitted less CH4 per MY-1 (P=0.0307) and per FCM-1 (P=0.0949) than Holstein cows (Figure 1).In the winter, CH4 emissions per ha (147.62 kg ha-1, P=0,0004), per MY (14.39 g kg MY-1, P=0,0003) and per FCM (14.47 g kg FCM-1, P=0,0004) were lower than in spring (323.95 kg ha-1, 19.33 g kg MY-1 and 20.51 g kg FCM-1, respectively) and summer (244.09 kg ha-1, 20.28 g kg MY-1, 21.47 g kg FCM-1, respectively). It was observed interaction between season and grazing system for total CH4 emissions per ha (P=0.0023). The total emission was higher in IIR system than in EXT in all seasons but the difference was smaller during the winter.423Methane emissions per area from Holstein and Holstein/Jersey dairy cows in two different grazing systems \u2013preliminary results The sulfur hexafluoride tracer technique,  as described by K.

However, Jersey-Holstein cows emitted less CH4 per MY-1 (P=0.0307) and per FCM-1 (P=0.0949) than Holstein cows (Figure 1).  Figure 1. CH4 emissions from lactating dairy cows according to genotype (Holstein vs Jersey-Holstein) during 270 days of lactating.   In the winter, CH4 emissions per ha (147.62 kg ha-1, P=0,0004), per MY (14.39 g kg MY-1, P=0,0003) and per FCM (14.47 g kg FCM-1, P=0,0004) were lower than in spring (323.95 kg ha-1, 19.33 g kg MY-1 and 20.51 g kg FCM-1, respectively) and summer (244.09 kg ha-1, 20.28 g kg MY-1, 21.47 g kg FCM-1, respectively). It was observed interaction between season and grazing system for total CH4 emissions per ha (P=0.0023). The total emission was higher in IIR system than in EXT in all seasons but the difference was smaller during the winter.  255.1 222.0 19.09 16.91 19.81 17.83 0 5 10 15 20 25 Holstein Jersey-Holstein 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 g CH4 (270 days)  kg CH 4 (270 days) CH4(kg ha-1) CH4 (g kg MY-1) CH4 (g kg FCM-1) * * Figure 1. CH  emissions from lactating dairy cows according to genotype (Hol-stein vs Jersey- Holstein) during 270 days of lactating.ConclusionsIt may be concluded that the higher methane emission per area in intensively managed grazing systems is compensated by the higher milk productivity in these systems, resulting in CH4 emission per kg of milk produced not different compared to less intensive systems. In that sense, intensifying milk production may attend the growing demand for milk without the opening of new areas, avoiding deforestation.Additionally, Jersey-Holstein cows seem to be an alternative to reduce CH4 emissions, emitting less CH4 per kg of milk produced than Holstein cows.ReferencesBerndt, A., T.

Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the forage intake and emis-sion of methane by goats fed grassland savanna during two periods of the year.Material and MethodsThe study was conducted at Semi-arid Embrapa in dry and rainy se-asons with 24 female goats grazing in Caatinga. On dry season, the animals received concentrated feed supplementation. The animals received titanium dioxide indicators of fecal output. We used rumi-nal emptying technique (SANTOS, 2008) for determining chemical composition and digestibility of diet. Dry matter intake, organic matter intake and crude protein intake were calculated. The methane was me-asured using methodology proposed by Johnson and Johnson (1995).Results and ConclusionsDry matter and organic matter intake were higher in the dry season, while the crude protein intake was similar between the two periods. There was no difference in relation the methane production. Supple-428Enteric methane emissions by goats in grazing in caatingamentation probably contributed to improve the intake of animals at the period when forage availability is reduced. The quality of provided supplementation helped to improve the feed efficiency of the animals during the dry season.Table 1.

This study monitored ambience and gaseous emissions in swine gestation rooms located in Concordia, Santa Catarina, where 12,5% of the sow herd is concentrated.Material and MethodsIn five weeks, from August to September 2014, naturally ventilated gestation rooms (box+stall) were monitored: daily, for temperature and relative humidity (using TESTO 174H data-loggers) and weekly, for air velocity, relative humidity, temperature (using a high precision probe TESTO 435) and gaseous concentrations (using air pumps and TEDLAR\u00ae bags), as described in ROBIN et al. (2006) and ROBIN et al. (2010). Feed and manure samples were collected weekly and daily water consumption was measured according to TAVARES (2014). Photo-acoustic reading of gas samples was carried in INNOVA 1412. Feed and manure were analysed according to the Standart Methods. Emission factors were quantified with respect to the concentration differences.Results and Conclusions432Concentration and Emission Factors of Greenhouse Gases and Ammonia in swine Gestation RoomsTable 1 \u2013Concentrations inside and outside de rooms (ppm)Lodging CO2 NH3 N2OBox 969,6 4,8 0,434Stall 990,9 6,6 0,434Outdoor 508,9 0,9 0,364Table 2 \u2013 Emission factors inside the rooms (g animal-1 day-1)Lodging N2O NH3 N CO2 CH4  CBox 0,4 7,3 7,7 743,9 16,9 760,8Stall 0,5 12,1 12,6 919,9 11,7 931,6Concentrations and emission factors were generally higher in stalls, respected legal thresholds and were in accordance with literature data.ReferencesROBIN, Paul, et al., 2006.

Individual DMI was estimated (NRC, 1996) during grazing and measured (offered - refused feed) during finishing. On that period steers were fed a high concentrate diet of corn grain, corn silage, sunflower expeller, mineral salt, and urea (68, 23, 6, 2.2, and 0.8% of DM, respectively).

E-mail address of presenting author*: pri.simon@hotmail.comIntroductionThe Brazilian cattle herd is over 200 million heads and its excreta contribute to 41% of the national nitrous oxide (N2O) emission, a potent greenhouse gas. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the emission factor (EF) of N2O from cattle urine or dung on pasture is 2% (Tier 1), but this is a global value that may not suit many agroecosystems around the world. The objective of this study was assess if this IPCC\u2019s 2% default EF for urine and dung N2O emission is appropriate for subtropical Brazilian pasture.Material and MethodsA field experiment on a Cambisol in Pinhais-PR, Brazil, included a control treatment (no excreta) and application of urine (U) and dung (E). The experimental design was a randomized block design with four replications. Metal collars of 0.083 m\u00b2 were inserted into the soil and served to delimit the treatment spots and to support the gas collec-ting chamber (static chamber method). Air samples were analyzed by gas chromatography. Assessments occurred from January to October 2014, in three seasons representing summer, autumn, and winter.442Nitrous oxide emission factor for cattle urine and dung in subtropical Brazilian pasturelandResults and ConclusionsThe emission factor for N2O-N across the three stations averaged 0.30% and 0.11% for urine and dung, respectively, lower than the 2% indicated by the IPCC. Different emission factors for urine and dung suggest that such excreta should be considered separately, not together, as suggested by the IPCC.Table 1.

The correct use of fertilizers in these areas, par-ticularly nitrogen, allows to recover the carrying capacity and vigor of plants, however, favors the emission of greenhouse  gases, mainly nitrous oxide (N2O). Thus, the objective was to characterize the emissions of N2O soil of Marandu palisadegrass pasture with nitrogen fertilizer in the Amazon biome.Material and MethodsThe experiment was conducted in a Amazon Biome area. Were evaluated six experimental plots of Marandu palisadegrass, including two N rates (0 and 50 kg / ha) in the form of Ammonium Sulfate with three replications, following a randomized block design. The gas samples were taken in March and April 2015 in two consecutive cycles of 28 days starting from the collection two days before fertili-zation. the method of static cameras (bottom-up model) for the col-lection of N2O was used. The gas analysis was taken descriptively, using the means of each treatment.444OXIDE NITROUS EMISSIONS IN MARANDU PALISADEGRASS IN FUNCTION OF DOSES NITROGEN FERTILIZERResults and ConclusionsThe flow rates of N2O during the experiment were higher in the fertili-zed pasture (174, 18 \u00b5g N m-2 h-1) than to the pasture without fer-tilization (101,05 \u00b5g N m-2 h-1) with higher peak registered 10 days after fertilization with the first 462,436 \u00b5g N m-2 h-1, and 4 days with 341,706 \u00b5g N m-2 h-1 after the second fertilization. Gomes (2006) reports that the increase in N2O emissions after fertilization indicates an intense effect and short-lived, ranging from days to just over a week after fertilization. Furthermore, the availability of nitrogen in the soil stimulates denitrifying bacteria that produce nitrate, interme-diate for the synthesis of N2O. Higher emissions of N2O are observed in Marandu palisadegrass pastures with nitrogen fertilizer.ReferencesDIAS-FILHO, M. B.

This work shows the selection of GHG calculators for on-farm assessments in pasture-based beef cattle systems in the tropics.Material and MethodsBased on the methodology proposed by Colomb et al. (2013), a litera-ture review was carried out for the identification of GHG calculators able to: 1) be applied under pasture-based beef cattle farms in the tropics, 2) cover all main on-farm sources and sinks (cattle, inputs and soil carbon stocks) and 3) allow variables and emission factors be free-ly changed by the user.Results and ConclusionsAfter literature review, more than 40 calculators were identified to estimate GHG emissions from agricultural systems. However, only two fit in the criteria described above: GHG- Protocolo Agricola (WRI, 2014) and EX-ACT (Bernoux et al., 2010). Although, the use of 450Selection of appropriate GHG emission calculators to evaluate on-farm pasture-based beef cattle production in the tropicsthese tools may show trade-offs. While the GHG-Protocol is more sen-sitive to capture variations in emissions of the herd, the EX-ACT can better represent changes in soil C stocks as well as the visualization of project additionalities.

COSTA11 Department of Agricultural Engineering, Federal University of Vi\u00e7osa, Minas Gerais \u2013 Brazil E-mail address of presenting author*: liviacrisdias@gmail.comIntroductionIn this work, we present a new high-resolution (approximately 1 km x 1 km) spatially explicit reconstruction of pastureland (natural and planted) from 1940 to 2012 and stocking rate of cattle maps from 1990 to 2012 which we used to investigate the shifting in historical patterns of the Brazilian livestock. Here we also present one of the possible uses for our land use database: the historical spatially explicit modeling of the methane emission from enteric fermentation in Brazilian livestock.Material and MethodsWe reconstructed the agricultural historical patterns by combining agricultural census data provided by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE - Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estat\u00edstica) and remote sensing data for entire Brazil at 30\u201d spatial resolution (approximately 1 km x 1 km). Methane emissions were calculated according to the Second Brazilian  Inventory  of  Anthropogenic  Greenhouse  Gas  Emission  and  Removal (2o Invent\u00e1rio Brasileiro de Emiss\u00f5es e Remo\u00e7\u00f5es Antr\u00f3picas de Gases de Efeito Estufa, MCTI, 2010).452Spatial Patterns of Pasturelands, Stocking Rates of Cattle, and Methane Emission Estimates from Enteric Fermentation in Brazilian LivestockResults and ConclusionsNatural pastureland expanded until the 1970s and, after that, most areas with natural pasture were replaced by planted pasture, which is more profitable. In 2012, natural pastures were still predominant in the Pampas and the Pantanal. On the other hand, planted pastureland expanded in area between 1975 and 2012, especially in the Cerrado biome. Brazilian stocking rate of cattle increased, but remains close to 1.0 head/ha between 1990 and 2010. Total pasturelands has decreased in area while stocking rates of cattle increased gradually in entire Brazil, except in Amazonia. The spatially explicit modeling of the methane emission from enteric fermentation show a spatial heterogeneity of emissions. Between 1990 and 2012, we observe the emergence of cores with high CH4 emissions in Rond\u00f4nia, eastern Par\u00e1, Mato Grosso, and Acre. Our results provide new insights about land use change, productivity, and GHG emissions in Brazilian territory that could guide future agricultural and conservation discussions, deci-sions, and policies.ReferencesMCTI, 2010.

With current UK climate commit-ments, UK agriculture is required to achieve a 34% reduction by 2020 (Comittee on Climate Change 2008). The livestock sector contribu-tes substantially to agricultural emissions (Moran et al. 2011) and hence is likely to come under considerable scrutiny. Quantifying and mitigating for GHG emissions from livestock is therefore of considera-ble policy importance.A number of footprinting tools, developed in a variety of contexts, are available to assist with this process (Colomb et al. 2012; Whit-taker et al. 2013). Whilst the relevance of such tools to policy is well recognised (e.g. Hall et al. 2010), an overarching lack of consensus in GHG accounting methods is apparent between tools, reflecting the range of contexts in which they are developed. Reviews to date have focused on largely or entirely on qualitative approaches to assess tools (e.g. Hall et al., 2010; Colomb et al., 2012; Whittaker et al., 2013). Given the limitations of such approaches, particularly where methodological transparency is lacking, the requirement for a com-prehensive, empirical assessment of the performance of these tools in the context of real-world data is increasingly apparent.460A Comparison of Farm-Level Greenhouse Gas Calculators in their Application on Beef Production SystemsThis study sought to fulfil that requirement through a critical compari-son of tool estimates based on representative UK livestock enterprises. Robust conclusions were sought as to the consequences of existing differences in accounting methods on the final farm-level footprint, and on corresponding implications for users and policy makers.Material and MethodsData from seven UK beef farms was sourced and used to produce a GHG footprint from five different farm-level calculators. Beef produc-tion was focused on for data collection; this reflects the high environ-mental impact of beef as compared to other livestock enterprises, and provides a link between each of the farms for comparison of emissions intensity. The farms represented a typical mix of UK beef production systems, and all contained additional crop and livestock enterprises.Calculators were selected based on pre-defined criteria. Tools had to be greenhouse gas calculators specific to the agricultural sector. Tools had to be, if not UK- specific, at least UK applicable. Additionally, it was determined that tools must be publically available without cost, and must function at farm level. The calculators chosen for compari-son were: AgRE Calc, a tool developed by SAC Consulting.The Cool Farm Tool, developed by the University of Aberdeen.The CALM Tool, developed by the Countryside Land & Business Asso-ciationCPLANv0, a tool developed by the agricultural consultancy business SEE360 Ltd.The CFF Tool, developed by the not-for-profit organisation Climate Friendly Food as part of the Farm Carbon Cutting Toolkit.Results and ConclusionsSeven farm-level datasets were processed through the five tools, giving a total of 35 emissions estimates. Excluding sequestration by woodland, these totals ranged from 0.15 (CPLANv0, Farm G) to 4.02 461A Comparison of Farm-Level Greenhouse Gas Calculators in their Application on Beef Production Systemskt CO2-eq year-1 (AgRE Calc, Farm A). A considerable amount of this variability is attributable to the tools themselves (Fig. 1).The CPLANv0 tool appears consistently below the general trend.

Total GHG footprints, including sequestration by woodland, for each of the five calculators over the seven sample farms.  Direct emissions from livestock varied considerably, and represented the largest overall emissions category, contributing between 43% and 92% (M = 72%, N = 35) to the overall farm-level footprint. Emissions from land/crops and embedded emissions were also highly variable. Fuel and electricity emissions were more consistent, whilst estimates of sequestration by woodland varied widely. GHG emissions intensities for beef production, in kg CO2-eq kg beef LW-1 were calculated for each estimate. The mean emissions intensities calculated by the tools showed some similarity to comparable values from the literature, though some tools, notably CPLANv0, underestimated by comparison. -1012345A B C D E F GWhole-Farm GHG Emissions (kt CO2-eq year-1 )Farm ReferenceAgRE CalcCool Farm ToolCALMCPLANv0CFF CalculatorFigure 1. otal GHG footprints, incl ding sequestration by woodland, for each of the five calculators over the seven sample farms.Direct emissions from livestock varied considerably, and represented the largest overall emissions category, contributing between 43% and 92% (M = 72%, N = 35) to the overall farm-level footprint.

Additionally, where tools are employed for scenario mo-delling purposes, such as to hypothetically test proposed mitigation 462A Comparison of Farm-Level Greenhouse Gas Calculators in their Application on Beef Production Systemsmeasures, it is vital that tools react predictably and consistently to changes in the input data. This study uncovered a number of areas where, owing to differences in methodology, this may not be the case.It is important that users of farm-level tools acknowledge these issues and treat results with appropriate caution. Particularly where a tool is sought for the purpose of influencing or informing policy decisions, it is vitally important not only that known variation be accounted for, but that areas of opacity in methodology be recognised and addressed. Similarly, it is essential that developers, in recognition of the  poten-tial impact of these tools, take steps to address the limitations which hinder  their application.ReferencesColomb, Vincent, Martial Bernoux, Louis Bockel, Jean-Luc Chotte, Sarah Martin, Cecile Martin-Phipps, Jerome Mousset, Marianne Tinlot, and Ophelie Touchemoulin. 2012.

Batch experiments of mesophilic anaerobic digestion using an Automatic Methane Potential Test System II (AMPTS II, Bioprocess control, Sweden) were applied for the tests of methane potential of the filter cakeand vinasse residues. The sample and inoculum collection was in an ethanol industry of the Goi\u00e1s State. The inoculum multiplication carried out under a minimal feeding regime and under physical chemical monitoring. Batch tests were performed following the treatments: (a) inoculum + vinasse, (b) inoculum + filter cake and (c) inoculum + a blendof filter cake and vinasse. The inoculum/substrate-ratio was 2 on the basis of volatile solids (VS). AMPTS II setup run under the same conditions in all experiments of 400 mL working volume and 250 mL headspace.465Mitigation of emissions from sugar cane crop by anaerobic digestion of sugarcane wastesResults and ConclusionsThe results of the AMPTS II tests showed that the methane potential of the blend of the residues of filter cake and vinasse in (c) tests was higher than the other treatments. The anaerobic digestion applied to the residues of the sugar cane processing may be an alternative way to mitigate emissions from the sugar cane crop, since the organic matter is being mineralized to biomethane and inorganic compounds before returning to the sugar cane field.ReferencesEPE.

The Brazilian cattle herd is over 200 million heads and its excreta contribute to 41% of national N2O emission. Thus the objective of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of dicyandiamide (DCD), a nitrification inhibitor at reducing the emission of N2O and determining the best way of applying the inhibitor, if sprayed onto or mixed with urine and dairy manure.Material and MethodsThe study was conducted at the experimental farm of the Federal University of Parana, in Pinhais-PR, from January to October 2014 in three seasons representing the Summer, Autumn and Winter. The tre-atments were: soil without excreta and without DCD (control group); application of urine (U), urine mixed with DCD (U+DM) and urine sprayed with DCD (U+DP); application of dung (D); dung mixed with DCD (D+DM) and dung sprayed with DCD (D+DP). The experimental design was a randomized block design with four replications. Metal collars of 0.083 m2 were inserted into the soil and served to delimit the treatment spots and to support the gas collecting chamber (static chamber method). Air samples were analyzed by gas chromatography.471Mitigation of nitrous oxide emission from cattle excreta in pasture with dicyandiamide (DCD)Results and ConclusionsThe use of DCD mixed with urine reduced N2O emissions by 79 and 55% in autumn and winter, respectively. When sprayed, DCD was efficient only in autumn, with a reduction of 45% of emission. In Summer, the use of DCD was not efficient to reduce emissions. In autumn, there was no significant difference in the forms of application of DCD, being both efficient in reducing emissions. For dung, DCD was significantly efficient only in winter, and when applied in mixed form, which may be related to the originally low N2O emission in this type of excreta.ReferencesIBGE - Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estat\u00edstica.

Grape marc re-present 20% of all grape processed in industry and it has been use to fertilize vines (MACHADO et al., 2015). Although, this grape marc can also be used to benefit nutritionally animals diet. Grape marc has also a good quantity of fat and tannins (Spanghero et al., 2009) which has been reported to be an efficient diet strategy to reduce meth-ane (CH4) from rumen. The aim was evaluate the influence of feeding sheep with grape marc on CH4 emissions.Material and MethodsThe experiment was conduct in an experimental sheep barn where eight animals were randomly allocate in two groups: control (CON) group and grape group (GG). The CON received a basal diet (BD) containing 440.3g of concentrate mix DM/d; 380.7g of alfalfa hay DM/d and 170g of rice grass hay DM/d. The GG received the BD with the repla-cement in 25% total dry matter by dried grape marc (DGM). Daily CH4 emission was measure using the SF6 tracer technique and the air sam-pling system used stainless steel cylinders (0.5 L volume) as sample 475Grape byproduct reduce enteric methane emissions when fed to sheepcollection device with sample flow regulated by a brass ball-bearing.Results and ConclusionsSheep of GG group had lower CH4 emissions (g/sheep per day) than CON group (P= 0,03). In the current experiment, we obtained a 14% decrease in CH4 emissions when dried grape marc was fed to sheep. The additional 25% of DGM decrease the enteric methane emission, but further studies has to be made to elucidate the main mechanism of this change.ReferencesIBRAVIN \u2013 Instituto Brasileiro do Vinho.

These areas may have yearly variations in flooding level and intensity, which favour certain plant species over others. This factor results in uncertainty concer-ning the forage availability, especially when facing extreme weather conditions of drought or flooding. This study has been conducted to detect natural forage species having adaptive phenotypic plasticity in wetlands to withstand extreme conditions in drought/flooding cycles. The screening targeted native forage species, which grow in wetlands and have been brought to the  Active Germplasm Bank (AGB) of natu-ral forages of the Pantanal. The AGB is located at the Nhumirim ran-ch, Nhecol\u00e2ndia sub-region, Pantanal, Mato Grosso do Sul State, by the edge of natural ponds. The AGB conserves accessions mainly of Hemarthria altissima, Hymenachne amplexicaulis and Steinchisma lax-um. However, accessions of other species such as Luziola subintegra, Oryza latifolia, Paspalum almum, P. fasciculatum, P. plicatulum and P. wrightii have also been included to assess their adaptation to we-tlands. It was observed that P. fasciculatum supported periods both of hydric stress and flooding better than the other species  maintained in the AGB, besides showing a high dry mass yield, even on sandy soil, therefore presenting a great potential for carbon sequestration. From these results, we recommend to continue collecting accessions of P. 477Adaptive phenotypic plasticity of the native forage grass Paspalum fasciculatum: a trait relevant to climatic changes in wetlandsfasciculatum from different Pantanal environments aiming at expanding its genetic diversity for future genetic improvement programs. Pas-palum fasciculatum is a vigorous (C4) native forage species with great potential  for optimizing carbon flow in different climatic conditions, as well as to contribute to the year round forage supply for livestock and wildlife, despite periodic flooding or drought.AcknowledgementsTo Embrapa, FUNDECT and CNPq for financial support478Feedlot pen surface greenhouse gases emissions from Nellore or Brangusbulls finished on diets with contrasting fat levelsFeedlot pen surface greenhouse gases emissions from Nellore or Brangus bulls finished on diets with contrasting fat levelsS\u00e9rgio Raposo de MEDEIROS1*, Ciniro COSTA J\u00daNIOR2, Rodrigo da Costa GOMES1, Carolina Tobias MARINO1, Paulo Eduardo Pedrosa BARROS31Embrapa Beef Cattle, Brazil; 2Institute of Agricultural and Forest Ma-nagement and Certification - Imaflora, Brazil, 3Federal University from the Vales of Jequitinhonha and Mucuri, Brazil;.

Fat levels were 3.2% and 6.4%, (ether extract % DM). Pens were rotationally occupied during all feedlot period (84 days) and each animal remained for at least 48 hours in two occasions in the pen of his respective treatment. GHG emission was measured using gas chambers (32 cm X 53 cm X 32 cm), according to Costa Jr. et al. (2014). The samples were analyzed for methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen oxi-de (NO2) by gas chromatography. Obtained values were used on for-mulas taking into account temperatures, chamber volume and surface area, atmospheric pressure and collection time to estimate the flux 479Feedlot pen surface greenhouse gases emissions from Nellore or Brangusbulls finished on diets with contrasting fat levelsof each gas as mass/area/time (mg/m2/d).

Further analysis including other effects (i.e. time, rain, soil moisture) are needed. The mean data of 81 g CO2-Eq./pen/day represents about 3% of the expected daily enteric emission of the animals.Table 1.

When this happens, statements assume a status of environmental vigilance, which manifests itself by means of irony, a figure of speech used in journalism to draw the attention of interlocutors. The aim of this qualitative study is to investigate how journalistic discourse stands in relation to the livestock raising/climate change duo at two distinct points in time for Brazilian agriculture and livestock raising research.Material and MethodsThe approach of French-school Discourse Analysis and Critical Discourse Analysis, developed by van Dijk (2005), provide the necessary tools to investigate and understand the meanings that involve the discursive process and the conditions under which it is produced and received. Two journalistic texts published in Brazil were evaluated: the first from 2009, in a CBN radio station broadcast, by columnist Arnaldo Jabor, criticizing the inertia with which Brazilian meat producers and consumers face the global warming issue; the second was published in 2016 by the O Globo newspaper informing the results of research conducted by Pecus Network, which indicates a new methodology to measure greenhouse gas emissions by livestock. The two statements were selected on purpose from the Google search platform.483Irony as a support for journalistic discourse on livestock raising and climate changeResults and ConclusionsDiscourse Analysis allows one to link signs found in statements to their authors\u2019 ideological positions. The two discourses that were analyzed reveal the conflict between two groups: those who call attention to the risks of livestock raising and are concerned with environmental causes (endogroup) and those related directly or indirectly with livestock raising practice (exogroup). In both cases, those making statements use irony to attract the attention of readers and listeners, to call for attitudes, to raise opinions and to indicate mistrust. The conclusion is that the use of irony in journalistic discourse is legitimate, but that it entails the risk that interlocutors might not understand its intention. This happens because irony works with implicit contradictions and requires that author and receiver present compatible mental models.ReferencesNEIVA, R. A.

In this sense integrated Crop--Livestock-Forest systems (iCLF) stand out as an alternative because with its diverse composition promotes a range of environmental ser-vices, including being carbon (C) sink due to its removal by its forest component. However there is only little information on the potential that iCLF has for carbon accumulation in the soil. Therefore, these systems have to be evaluated under field conditions and in different biomes of Brazil so that we can confirm this behavior. This study aimed to contribute to the analysis of an iCLF system in the Brazilian savan-nah in Goi\u00e1s state.Material and MethodsThe evaluation was made three years after its implementation in sou-thern Goi\u00e1s State of Brazil, in the Boa Vereda Farm (18\u00b027\u201943.19\u201dS, 49\u00b035\u201958.53\u201dW), where the iCLF, conventional pasture (CP) and a recovered pasture (RP) were implemented. Total organic carbon (TOC) and nitrogen (N) concentrations were evaluated up to a meter depth in eight layers. In the iCLF each sampling point had six soil profiles placed in different positions to represent situations according to the presence or not of trees and transition zones between trees and pasture. The 487The Impact of the Implementation of an Integrated Crop-Livestock-Forest System in a Ferralsol of the Brazilian Savannah (Cerrado)soil texture, bulk density and the isotope ratio (\u03b4\u00b9\u00b3C) were evaluated to validate the comparability of the investigated areas.Results and ConclusionsStudy results showed that the management used during the im-plementation of iCLF, which included soil tillage with disc plowing, influenced negatively the C and N stocks in the 0-0.3m layer. Ano-ther factor that likely influenced the input of C and N in the soil was the low productivity of the pasture, result of the shading by the eucalyptus trees (Eucalyptus urograndis) on the grass (Urochloa brizan-tha), due to the implementation of eucalyptus rows in the north-south direction. Considering a layer 0.0 to 1.0 m, however, the manage-ment did not influence the stock of TOC and total N due to compensa-tion of the loss of the stock of TOC and total N in the surface layer by the accumulation of these elements in deeper layers (0.3-1.0 m). Thus, despite the loss of carbon and nitrogen in the surface layer of the soil, it was possible to infer that the iCLF showed potential for carbon accu-mulation in the soil, the deeper layers after three years of its implemen-tation.Acknowledgements to Embrapa; CNPq and FAPEG/CAPES for financial supporting.

The ob-jective of this study was to evaluate the potential of the NT and ICL in stocks of C and N in the soil, in a nine-year experiment in a subtropical Oxisol Bruno, Castro, Parana, Brazil.Material and MethodsSelected treatments were: ryegrass (Lolium multiflorium) grazed by dairy cattle in winter and maize (Zea mays) silage in the summer, in conventional tillage with plowing and disking in winter (ICL-CT) or no--till (ICL-NT); and continuous crop system where ryegrass served only as cover crop in conventional tillage (CC-CT) or no-till (CC-NT). Soil samples up to 1 m depth were analyzed by dry combustion (elemen-tary Vario EL III) for determination of C and N; stocks were based on the values of concentration of C and N and density, and were sub-sequently corrected by the equivalent mass of soil, which considers 489Soil carbon and nitrogen stocks in subtropical Oxisol in southern Brazil under tillage systems and integrated crop-livestockequal mass of soil between treatments, and the PC as a reference ( Sisti et al., 2004).Results and ConclusionsNT increased C stock in the 0-20 cm, both in CC and in ICL at rates of 0.26 and 0.52 Mg ha-1 year-1, respectively; with the same trend for N, accumulation rate of 0.3 Mg ha-1 year-1 to CC and 0.4 Mg ha-1 year-1 for the ICL. Up to 1 m deep, increasing the C stock with NT was significant in CC system, at a rate 1.51 Mg C ha-1 year-1; but no increase was observed with ICL. Compared to crop system, ICL did not affect the C or N stocks in 0-20 cm, both your CT and NT. Up to 1 m deep, the same result occurred in NT, but in CT stocks of C and N were higher in the ICL, with C sequestration rates of 1.14 Mg ha-1 year-1 and N accumulation 0.08 Mg ha-1 year-1. In conclusion, NT has potential to accumulate C and N in the soil when in continuous crop; however, ICL in NT showed no increase of C and N in relation to the CC.ReferencesSISTI, C.P.J.; SANTOS, H.P.; KOHHANN, R.; ALVES, B.J.R.; URQUIAGA, S.; BODDEY, R.M.

We investigated if iCLF was able to improve soil C stocks when implemented on an area of pasture showing signs of overgrazing.Material and MethodsOur study was carried out in the north of Mato Grosso State, in Bra-zil, a transitional region between the Amazon and Cerrado ecosystems (10\u00ba38\u201913\u201d S, 55\u00ba42\u201932\u201d W). Two areas under iCLF were selected (iCLF1 and iCLF3, systems with one and three rows of Eucalyptus urograndis by hedgerow, respectively) and an overgrazed pasture.

We investigated if iCLF was able to improve soil C stocks when implemented on an area of pasture showing signs of overgrazing.  Material and Methods Our study was carried out in the north of Mato Grosso State, in Brazil, a transitional region between the Amazon and Cerrado ecosystems (10\u00ba38'13\" S, 55\u00ba42'32\" W). Two areas under iCLF were selected (iCLF1 and iCLF3, systems with one and three rows of Eucalyptus urograndis by hedgerow, respectively) and an overgrazed pasture. The soil was a clayey Oxisol (\u201cLatossolo vermelho-amarelo distr\u00f3fico\u201d, SiBCS). The climate was Aw, according to K\u00f6ppen\u2019s classification. The areas have been cultivated since 1998, and was converted into iCLF in 2009. Soil samples were collected from 0.00-0.05; 0.05-0.10; 0.10-0.20, 0.20-0.30; 0.30-0.40; 0.40-0.60; 0.60-0.80 and 0.80-1.00 m soil layers to quantify the bulk density, texture, total C content and isotope ratio (\u03b4\u00b9\u00b3C) of the soil. In areas under iCLF samples were taken from the influence zone of the trees to the middle of the pasture zone. Carbon stocks were analyzed for the 0.0 to 0.3 and 0.0 to 1.0 m soil layers.  Results and Conclusions The isotopic composition of the soil was affected by the implementation of iCLF, and the forestry component was a major important factor in the accumulation of C in the soil. The C accumulation in the soil at all sampling positions was greater in the iCLF3 and in the iCLF1 (in the area under the influence of trees) than in the pasture (Table 1).

The higher carbon content for ICLF probably can be assigned to the contribution of eucalyptus plants litter and  first thinning residues, however other factors such as roots and different grazing intensities can affect the soil carbon contents.

Soil quality in terms of carbon content in these soils is a useful tool to estimate sustainable production. In this study is presented results of 7 years of integrated crop-livestock and crop-livestock-forest systems on soil carbon contents in a clayed Oxisol of the Brazilian Cerrado.Material and Methods.The field experiment was carried out in an area of degraded pasture (20o 26\u2019 S, 54o 43\u2019W, 530 m asl) at Embrapa Beef Cattle Research Center, Campo Grande, MS, Brazil since 2008/09. Details are explained in Oliveira et al. (2012), and Pereira et al. (2014). Treatments included ICL (integrated crop-livestock, no trees), ICLF14 (integrated crop-livestock-forest with single line of trees, 14 m apart) and ICLF22 (lines of trees 22m apart). Soybeans were cultivated conventionally in 2008/09 and no-till in 2012/13. Grazed pastures of Brachiaria brizantha cv. BRS Piat\u00e3 were cultivated between eucalyptus trees, after soybeans. Two transects lines, composed by 10 single soil samples/transect, were taken yearly in May-June, to 20 cm depth, and analyzed for total C in an autoanalyser (Sumika/Shimadzu).495Soil carbon contents in integrated crop-livestock-forest systemsResults and Conclusions.Over a 7 years period, soil under ICL, showed a positive trend and highest values of total C content as compared with ICLF14 or ICLF22 (Table 1). ICL system (no trees) had less competition for light, water and nutrients, and provided greater source of organic matter for soil carbon, than grass/pasture combined with trees. Availability of total  grass  biomass  in ICL appears to be a better source of organic mat-ter, specially root mass, in order to increase soil  carbon contents.Table 1.

It is based almost exclusively on native pasture, which has gene-rally low biomass availability. From the 90\u2019s, the Pantanal farmer\u2019s began to introduce exotic grasses species replacing native pastures of low quality, in order to increase the forage mass availability (mixed pastures). Monitoring the forage availability depending on the envi-ronmental conditions and human activities is essential to define good management practices. It is known that the indications for reducing methane emissions from livestock are linked to the food management and nutritional strategies. This study aimed to monitor the variation of forage mass availability of Pantanal areas with native and mixed pas-ture, grazing place for cattle. It is part of PECUS Network - Greenhouse gases (GHG) dynamics in livestock production systems from Brazil. The mixed pasture were composed by three species of Urochloa (bri-zantha, humidicola and dictyoneura). The assessment of the pasture biomass production was held twice during the rainy and dry seasons, respectively in April and September of 2014 and 2015. The yearly precipitation in 2013/14 was 1097.9 mm and in 2014/15 1145.8 mm, within the normal range for the area. Biomass measurement was carried out with the use of 0.5m x 0.5m squares, randomly allocated, in a total of 100 sampling points. There are presented the following results: biomass availability (kgDM.ha-1); botanical composition, which is the percentage of the species present in the biomass availability, and soil cover (%). Taking in account the two areas, a greater biomass avai-,497Aboveground biomass availability in native and cultivated pastures in the Pantanal Nhecolandia, Brazillability was found in the native pasture one in the rainy season of the first year (5174 kgDM.ha-1 in April/14), noting that this area has been fenced prior to the animals enter. No differences were found out in the others evaluations (2267 kgDM.ha-1 in Sep / 14; 2686 kg DM.ha-1 in April/15 and 2811 kg DM.ha-1 in Sep/15). Two species contributed to the botanical composition: Cynodon dactylon and Urochloa subquadri-para. Since both of them are exotic species, this result indicates a hi-ghly disturbed area. In the mixed pasture results of the biomass availabi-lity were different between years and seasons. They ranged from 1757 kgDM.ha-1; 2435 kgDM.ha-1; 3541 kgDM.ha-1 and 4574 kgDM.ha-1, respectively in Apr/14; Sep/14; Apr/15 and Sep/15. The botanical composition was quite different between the first and second year. In 2014 the dominant species was U. humidicola whereas in 2015 it was U. dictyoneura. The soil cover in native pasture was 100% during all the sampling, and in the mixed pasture ranged from 90 to 96%, which indicates a good soil protection. These data are important in the asses-sment of methane emission by cattle, since environmental factors such as botanical composition and biomass forage production interfere in the animal   metabolism.498Carbon stock on a beef cattle ranch in a savanna woodland area in the Pantanal, BrazilCarbon stock on a beef cattle ranch in a savanna woodland area in the Pantanal, BrazilSuzana SALIS1, Ana MAROZZI-FERNANDES1*, Fernando FERNANDES1, Patr\u00edcia MATTOS2, Ivan BERGIER1, Sandra Mara CRISPIM1, Carlos Ro-drigo LEHN31 Embrapa Pantanal, 2 Embrapa Florestas, 3 Instituto Federal de Educa\u00e7\u00e3o, Ci\u00eancia e Tecnologia FarroupilhaE-mail address of presenting author*: ana.marozzi-fernandes@embrapa.brThe amount and distribution of biomass in agroecosystems expresses the carbon sequestration or mitigation potential of emissions released into the atmosphere. Estimates of total biomass and carbon in vegeta-tion and soil are therefore essential to determine whether an agricul-tural activity is neutral, a source or a sink for greenhouse gases. The objectives of this study were to estimate the total stock of biomass and carbon contained in the native vegetation and the soil on a beef cattle farm in a savanna woodland area in the Nhecol\u00e2ndia region of Pan-tanal in Corumb\u00e1, state of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. Woody biomass (stems and roots) was estimated from a statistical regression analysis of field data (destructive sampling). The best regression adjustment was obtained with exponential or potential equations, depending on the species. Herbaceous biomass (shoots and roots) was also estima-ted from field data (destructive sampling). Herbaceous roots and fine roots (of woody species) were collected at depths of 0 to 40 cm, using a zinc box for the former and a soil auger for the latter, both with kno-wn volumes. Soil carbon sampling was carried out at seven points ac-cording to the plant species under study, at depths of 0-10 cm, 10-20 cm and 20-40 cm. Soil bulk density was estimated based on pedo-genetic relationships. The total biomass (above and below ground level) was estimated at 161.34 Mg ha-1 and total carbon at 75.42 Mg ha-1. The soil carbon stock was estimated at 17.85 Mg C ha-1, which, added to the total biomass carbon, resulted in 93.27 Mg C ha-1. Unlike what 499Carbon stock on a beef cattle ranch in a savanna woodland area in the Pantanal, Brazilhas been observed in other savanna woodland environments, the data revealed a relatively higher aerial biomass than root biomass, as well as a higher carbon stock in biomass than in soil. Proportionally, the soil was found to store only 19.14% of the total carbon stock of this agroecosystem.

    "abstract": "Climate change is without question one of the largest challenges that humankind has ever faced. This is not the least due to the enormous consequences that climate change will have for ecosystems and human society. Unfortunately, climate change also poses a very difficult problem for politicians to deal with.

Olesen, Dept. of Agroecology and Environment, Aarhus University, Denmark \n \nClimate change is without question one of the largest challenges that humankind has ever faced. \nThis is not the least due to the enormous consequences that climate change will have for ecosystems \nand human society. Unfortunately, climate change also poses a very difficult problem for politicians \nto deal with. The core of the problem affecting modern democracies is that most people experience \nvery little relationship between greenhouse gas emissions, climate change and their everyday life. \nThere is both a temporal and spatial separation between emissions and impacts of climate change. \nThe industrialized countries, which currently emit most of the greenhouse gases, are in general the \nleast vulnerable to climate change effects. Additionally, many of the detrimental effects of climate \nchange will happen far later (decades to centuries) than the greenhouse gas emissions. It is therefore \ndifficult to achieve substantial popular support for necessary and effective measures to mitigate \nclimate change.  \n \nAgriculture and food production plays an important role in this connection due to the importance of \nclimate change for agriculture\u2019s production basis and because of the large emissions of greenhouse \ngases from agriculture. For agriculture, the climate change challenge is therefore double \u2013 it must \nboth adapt to the changes and at the same time reduce its emissions of greenhouse gases. \n \nAgriculture\u2019s emissions \n \nAgricultural production results in emissions of several greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide \n(CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Methane and nitrous oxide are 23 and 296 times \nmore powerful greenhouse gases than CO2.  \n \nCO2 from biological processes is in principle neutral in relation to the global warming, since CO2 \nassimilated from the atmosphere during plant photosynthesis will eventually be transformed in the \necological food-web and respired again as CO2. However, there are large stores of carbon in soils \nand vegetation that if released will more than triple current atmospheric CO2 concentrations. \nTherefore even small changes in soil and vegetation stocks through changes in land use and \nmanagement may significantly affect global warming. In particular, conversion of forests to \nagriculture and the cultivation of carbon rich wetlands can lead to large emissions of CO2 and N2O. \nFurther, agriculture has an energy consumption, primarily of fossil fuels, that also contributes to \nCO2 emissions. This can in part be compensated for through use of biomass for energy production. \n \nThe carbon contents of agricultural soils can be influenced through the addition of crop residues and \nanimal manure. The increase in soil carbons storage is particularly large under grasslands, and a \npart of the carbon accumulation occurs in the subsoil.  In addition, the intensity of soil tillage plays \na role for soil carbon storage. Adoption of no tillage systems, which reduces soil disturbance, will \nthus lead to reduced soil organic matter turnover and increased soil carbon contents.  \n \nMethane is formed during decomposition of organic material under completely anaerobic (oxygen-\nfree) conditions, such as those found in the digestive systems of animals and in ecosystems that are \npermanently waterlogged (e.g., from rice paddies). Ruminant digestion is the greatest single source \nof methane in agriculture. However, methane can also be formed during manure storage, in \nparticular from liquid manure stored at relatively high temperatures. There are some possibilities for 2 \n \nreducing methane emissions from enteric fermentation by changing feeding practices, e.g. by \nincreasing the fat content of feed and substituting sugar with starch in the feed. Treatment of \nmanure in biogas plants has large potentials for reducing the greenhouse gas emissions from manure \nstorages. \n \nNitrous oxide is primarily formed as an intermediate product in the bacterial nitrogen cycle. It can \nbe formed either through the nitrification of ammonium to nitrate or through the denitrification of \nnitrate to dinitrogen (N2). In either case, nitrous oxide formation depends on the availability of \nmineral nitrogen (ammonium and nitrate) in the soil. A number of soil conditions affect the \nbacterial nitrogen cycle leading to nitrous oxide emissions, including high water content, a mixture \nof anaerobic and aerobic zones, accessibility of organic matter, and soil pH. Emissions of nitrous \noxide can be reduced by avoiding excessive nitrogen fertilisation and reducing losses through \nammonia volatilisation and nitrate leaching. Measures that increase soil aeration will tend to reduce \nnitrous oxide emissions during periods of high soil mineral nitrogen concentrations. \n \nOn a global scale, greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture are estimated at 17-32 per cent of \ntotal emissions. A very large proportion of this is related to livestock production. The large \nuncertainty is related to how much of the emissions from clearing forests and cultivation of new \nland can be attributed to agriculture. \n \nClimate impacts of food consumption \n \nEuropean studies have shown that the consumption of food products, beverages, tobacco and other \nstimulants contributes 21-31 % of the total EU greenhouse gas emissions. Meat and dairy products \nare the foods that have the greatest impact on climate (see Table 1). Vegetables generally have the \nsmallest contribution to global warming. \n \nAgricultural production is the link in the production chain, which for all food products is associated \nwith the largest emissions, whereas in general only a smaller part of the emissions come from \nmanufacturing, packaging and transport. Initiatives to support climate-friendly food should \ntherefore primarily be directed to improving agricultural practices.  \n \nLife-cycle analyses of food production systems in Denmark have shown that the annual emissions \nof a milk cow is about 14 ton CO2, from a sow with associated production of fatteners about 7.5 ton \nCO2, and arable crop production about 3.5 ton CO2 per ha. An analysis of available measures for \nreducing emissions show that the realistic potential for emissions reductions in Danish agriculture is \nabout 15, 20 and 30 % for dairy, pig and arable production systems, respectively. At the global level \nthe largest reduction potentials are found for accumulation of carbon in restoring degraded lands \nand avoiding CO2 emissions from intensive cultivation of peat soils.  \n \nEmissions from organic farming \n \nOrganic farming contributes to emissions of the same greenhouse gases as conventional farming. \nHowever, management is in many respects different in organic systems, and this affects both soil \ncarbon storage and emissions of methane and nitrous oxide. There are few experimental and \nmodelling studies that compare greenhouse gas emissions from organic and conventional farming. \nHowever, they mostly point to lower emissions from organic systems on a per area basis, whereas \nthere is often little difference in emissions, when organic and conventional systems are compared 3 \n \non a unit product (kg or litre) basis. This is particularly the case for cool temperate climates, where \nconventional systems normally out-yield organic systems. The higher rate of soil organic matter \nturnover in warmer climates improves crop nitrogen supply under organic farming in these climates, \nand organic farming therefore typically does not result in large yield reductions in warm temperate, \nsubtropical and tropical climates. This also means that the greenhouse gas effect of organic farming \nwill be relatively more positive for warmer climates. \n \nIn some respects organic farming provides clear benefits over conventional systems: (1) No \nfertilisers or pesticides are used, which eliminates the energy consumption associated with the \ninputs, (2) The biological nitrogen fixation reduces the nitrous oxide emissions during cultivation of \nlegume crops, (3) the higher proportion of green manure crops, cover crops and use of animal \nmanure builds soil carbon contents, and (4) a better soil structure in organic farming reduces risks \nof high nitrous oxide emissions. However, there are also some possible disadvantages, including the \nneed for intensive soil cultivation to manage weeds, and the nitrous oxide emissions associated with \nincorporation of nitrogen rich green manure crops and cover crops. \n \nThere has so far been little attention within the organic farming research and advice on reduction of \nthe greenhouse gas emissions, and in many respects a better understanding of how management in \norganic farming affects the processes giving rise to greenhouse gas emissions is needed. There are \nlikely many opportunities for making organic farming systems more climate-friendly. A better \nintegration of bioenergy systems into organic farming would assist this, e.g. through growing \nperennial nitrogen fixing crops for bioenergy purposes and use of anaerobic digestion of manure \nand crop residues to produce biogas and improve the quality of manures. \n \nImpacts and adaptation to climate change \n \nClimate change affect cropping systems through a wide range of direct and indirect pathways. The \neffects may be positive or negative depending on current climate and soils, and depending on the \ndirection of change. So far, research on climate change impacts in agriculture has given little \nemphasis on changes in frequency of extreme events. However, the impacts of increased climate \nvariability on plant production are likely to increase yield losses above those estimated from \nchanges in mean climate only. This is primarily linked with changes in the frequency of extreme \nheat waves and changes in rainfall patterns, including more intensive precipitation events and \nlonger drought periods. Changes in climate variability may be particular difficult for many farmers \nto adapt to, and adaptation strategies to cope with variability may be different than from those \ndealing with changes in mean climate. Strategies for adapting to increased variability may include \nmeasures to avoid periods of high stress or measures that increase resilience of the system by \nadding diversity in the crop rotation and improving soil and water resources. \n \nMost of the processes causing soil degradation are enhanced by climate change, being promoted by \nhigher temperatures, more intense rainfall and longer drought periods, which lead to lower soil \ncarbon stocks, increased soil erosion and salinization. Yet, higher soil carbon contents and better \nsoil structure will be critical for cropping systems to cope with increased climate variability. There \nis clearly a need within research, advice and policy to focus more on those aspects of agricultural \nsystems that build resilience. Organic farming has a large role to play here, since such practices to \nincrease resilience are intrinsic components of organic farming systems. Evidence is also \naccumulating that the agroecological approaches taken in organic farming provide considerable \nprotection of crop and land under heat waves as well as tropical storms.   4 \n \nTable 1.

The program has become a model for policymakers in the United States and in other \ncountries that are considering cap-and-trade programs to reduce emissions. Once a theoretical \noption discussed only by economists, emissions trading is now considered a mainstream policy \ninstrument in the United States with bipartisan political support. Internationally, emissions \ntrading is no longer considered a \u201ccrazy American idea.\u201d It is now a fundamental component of \nthe international framework to address climate change. Even developing countries from Chile to \nChina are beginning to consider emissions trading programs to control conventional pollutants \n(U.S. EPA 2004a). \nMany articles and studies have examined the lessons learned from the SO2 trading \nprogram for greenhouse gas (GHG) trading. At the same time, fundamental differences between \nthe climate change issue and conventional air pollution problems have led a number of authors to \nargue that certain features of the SO2 program should be modified to address climate change. \nAnalysis of both the similarities and differences between SO2 and greenhouse gases has also \ninformed U.S. legislative and policy proposals.  \nWhile debate on the optimal design of greenhouse gas trading programs continues, there \nis still no consensus at the federal policymaking level on the need for a mandatory program. \nHowever, the successful experience with SO2 trading has inspired other domestic and \ninternational initiatives. These initiatives are incorporating lessons from SO2 trading as they \nanticipate and try to shape the future of greenhouse gas trading. For example, private companies \nare adopting voluntary targets and other initiatives, some of which are designed to influence \n                                                 \n\u2217 Kruger is a visiting scholar at Resources for the Future.

State governments in nine New England and Mid-Atlantic states \nare developing a regional greenhouse gas cap-and-trade program, which is designed to encourage \ncertain elements of a national program. States are also developing emissions registries, which \nmay have implications for the design of future national trading programs. Finally, the European \nUnion has recently begun operation of the world\u2019s largest emissions trading program. As a \u201cfirst \nmover\u201d on emissions trading, the EU program could set precedents and develop new features \nthat may have an impact on the ultimate design of both the international trading regime and any \npotential U.S. domestic program. \nIn this paper I will discuss the path from SO2 to greenhouse gas trading from both a \ndesign and a political economy perspective. First, I will briefly summarize the literature on the \n\u201clessons learned\u201d from the SO2 trading program for greenhouse gas trading. This will include \ndiscussion of potential differences in design that may be necessary because of the different \nsources, science, mitigation options, and economics of the climate change issue. Next, I will \ndiscuss how the three initiatives mentioned above have been shaped by lessons from past trading \nprograms and are making changes to the SO2 model to address greenhouse gases. Finally, I will \nconclude with an assessment of the most likely impacts from these initiatives on a future U.S. \nfederal greenhouse gas trading program.  \n2 SO2 Trading: Lessons Learned \nThe SO2 trading program has been widely studied, and there is an extensive literature \nexamining various aspects of the program.1 A subset of this literature has looked specifically at \nlessons that would apply to greenhouse gas trading.2 In general, most authors view the SO2 \nprogram as a successful experiment, proving that emissions trading can be an effective and \nefficient policy instrument. Many authors have noted that emissions trading is particularly well \nsuited for greenhouse gases because it is uniformly mixed and does not require limitations on \ntrading to limit \u201chot spots.\u201d  \n                                                 \n1 For economic assessments of the SO2 program see Ellerman et al. 2000, Carlson et al. 2000, and Burtraw and \nPalmer 2004. For an independent assessment of the benefits of the program, see Burtraw et al. 1999. U.S. EPA \n2004b summarizes the environmental impacts of the program. \n2 See, for example, Stavins 1998, ELI 1997, Tietenberg 2003, and Ellerman 2005, and Burtraw et al. 2005. \n2 Resources for the Future  Kruger \nAnalysis of the SO2 program also sheds light on specific design elements that would be \ndesirable to apply to a future greenhouse gas trading program. For example, experience with the \nSO2 trading program has shown significant benefits from the temporal flexibility provided by \nbanking provisions (Burtraw and Palmer 2004, Stavins 2003, Ellerman et al. 2000).3 Second, \nanalysts have noted that allowance distribution, particularly the allocation of allowances at no \ncost to affected facilities, has been critical in gaining political acceptance for the emissions \ntrading concept (Stavins 1998, Ellerman 2005). Third, authors have emphasized the importance \nof strong monitoring and enforcement provisions, including reasonably accurate emissions \nmeasurement, automatic excess emissions penalties that are not subject to appeal or waivers \n(Ellerman 2003, Swift 2001), and public access to emissions and trading data through the use of \ninformation technology and the Internet (Tietenberg 2003, Kruger et al. 2000). Finally, observers \nhave lauded the hands-off design of the cap-and-trade model, in which regulators track emission \nresults but don\u2019t interfere in company decisions on emissions reduction options or conduct case-\nby-case reviews of trades (Ellerman 2005). \nWhile there is general agreement that the SO2 program \u201cproves the concept\u201d of emissions \ntrading for a greenhouse gas program, there is also considerable discussion in the literature about \nmodifications to the basic SO2 model that would be needed for a greenhouse gas program. \nAlthough a full discussion of these differences is beyond the scope of this paper, these \ndifferences boil down into five types. First, analysts have noted that the ideal program for \ngreenhouse gas trading would be economy-wide, rather than in specific sectors (e.g., electric \npower). This is because of the prevalence of CO2 in virtually every economic sector and the \nefficiencies that arise by equalizing marginal costs across the entire economy. To facilitate an \neconomy-wide system, these analysts have argued that CO2 emissions should be regulated \n\u201cupstream\u201d (i.e., by producers or processors of fuel) rather than \u201cdownstream\u201d (i.e., direct \nemitters such as power plants and industrial facilities) to capture the largest percentage of \nemissions and to encompass the fewest number of sources (Keeler 2002, Morgenstern 2005 \nforthcoming). 4  \n                                                 \n3 In contrast, the lack of an adequate banking provision in the RECLAIM trading program in Southern California \nmay have been at least partially responsible for extreme price volatility following high electricity demand in 2000. \nSee Ellerman et al. 2003. \n4 A hybrid system with both upstream and downstream elements is also possible (ELI 1997, Hargrave 2000). See \nBaron and Bygrave 2002 for a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of different points of obligation for \nholding allowances. \n3 Resources for the Future  Kruger \nSecond, a trading system should consider multiple greenhouse gases to capture the widest \narray of cost-effective sources.5 For example, Reilly et al. (2003) find that inclusion of all six \ngreenhouse gases regulated under the Kyoto agreements could provide increased emissions \nreduction at a lower cost.6 Inclusion of multiple gases in Kyoto and other trading regimes is \npossible because of a system of global warming potential (GWP) factors, which have been \nadopted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). These GWP factors serve as \nan \u201cexchange rate\u201d to set equivalencies for the six gases regulated under the Kyoto agreement.  \nThird, because of the magnitude of the emission allowance assets involved, a greenhouse \ngas trading program should consider auctioning, rather than free distribution of allowances. For \nexample, Cramton and Kerr (2002) describe a number of equity benefits from the auctioning of \nallowances, including providing a source of revenue that could potentially address inequities \nbrought about by a carbon policy, creation of an equal opportunity for new entrants in the \nallowance market, and avoiding the potential for \u201cwindfall profits\u201d that might accrue to \nemissions sources if allowances are allocated at no charge.7 Goulder et al. (1999) and Dinan and \nRogers (2002) found that recycling revenues from auctioned allowances could have economy-\nwide efficiency benefits if they are used to reduce certain types of taxes.  \nFourth, some analysts have advocated additional mechanisms to limit price risks from a \ngreenhouse gas trading system.8 For example, Pizer (2002) proposes a \u201csafety valve\u201d mechanism \nthat would mitigate price risks by allowing sources to purchase additional allowances at a set \nprice if allowance prices rise to that level. Kolstad (2005 forthcoming) finds that intensity \ntargets, i.e., targets that index emissions to GDP or production, can reduce uncertainties \nassociated with the cost of emission reduction under uncertain economic growth levels. \nAdvocates of these types of mechanisms argue that CO2 prices may be more unpredictable than \n                                                 \n5 Stavins and Richards (2005) find that biologic carbon sequestration is also a cost-effective strategy that could be \npart of a climate mitigation regime.  \n6 In cases where it may be difficult to measure total mass from these sources but relatively easy to measure emission \nreductions (e.g., reductions of methane from a landfill) these sources might be captured with project-level offset \nprovisions rather than through inclusion in the cap-and-trade program (U.S. EPA 2003). \n7 Bovenberg and Goulder 2001, and Burtraw et al. 2002 find that allocating only a small portion of allowances at no \ncost can compensate industry for losses due to a carbon policy. \n8 Allowance banking can also serve this function by creating a cushion that will prevent price spikes and hedge \nuncertainty in allowance prices (Jacoby and Ellerman 2004). Jacoby and Ellerman (2004) also note that some \nenvironmental groups have opposed a safety valve because it creates less certainty about the quantity that will be \nemitted.  \n4 Resources for the Future  Kruger \nSO2 prices because there are relatively few mitigation options for CO2, and there are currently no \ncost-effective post-combustion controls.9 Moreover, CO2 is a \u201cstock pollutant,\u201d which \naccumulates in the atmosphere over an extended period. There is therefore less concern over \nshort-term increase of CO2 as long as the overall trajectory of CO2 emissions is downward over \nan extended period. \nFinally, many analysts have advocated international trading of greenhouse gas \nallowances, given that the atmosphere is indifferent to the location of emission reductions. \nInternational trading provides opportunities to incorporate reductions from developing countries \nlike China and India, where analysis shows some of the lowest cost emission reduction \nopportunities (Ellerman and Decaux 1998). This concept is fundamental to the Kyoto Protocol, \nwhich provides for international trading among parties and for the development of project-level \noffsets in developing countries (Tietenberg et al. 1999). \n2.1 Legislative and Policy Proposals for Greenhouse Gas Trading \nMany of the features discussed above have been incorporated into legislative and policy \nproposals for greenhouse gas trading programs. For example, the McCain-Lieberman Climate \nStewardship Act (S. 139) would cover much of the economy and would address the \ntransportation sector \u201cupstream\u201d by requiring oil refiners to hold allowances. The McCain- \nLieberman bill allows for emissions offsets (including non-CO2 and biologic sequestration \nprojects) and contains provisions for international trading, as does a bill introduced by Senator \nCarper (S. 843) that addresses CO2 and other emissions in the electric power sector. Finally, an \neconomy-wide, upstream proposal by the National Commission on Energy Policy (NCEP) \nincludes an intensity-based target and a price cap to limit price uncertainties (NCEP 2004).10\nWhile debate continues on these policy proposals, there is still no consensus in Congress \non the need for a mandatory program, and few believe that new legislation will be adopted \nquickly.11 Meanwhile, the Bush administration has rejected a mandatory approach to climate \n                                                 \n9 In the longer term, there may be cost-effective technologies to remove and sequester CO2 from combustion. See \nNewell and Anderson 2004. \n10 Senator Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico has reportedly developed draft legislation based on the NCEP proposal \n(Eilperin, 2005). \n11 Although the Senate has adopted a non-binding resolution calling for a mandatory market-based program to \naddress greenhouse gases (Blum, 2005), no such resolution has been adopted by the House of Representatives. \n5 Resources for the Future  Kruger \nchange. Instead, the administration has emphasized the long-term development of \u201cclimate-\nfriendly\u201d technology and the improvement of energy intensity through the implementation of a \nsuite of voluntary measures.12  \nThus, the most direct road to a national program, i.e., new national legislation, appears to \nbe blocked for now. Instead, a variety of other initiatives, all of which were influenced by past \nU.S. trading programs, are establishing \u201cfacts on the ground\u201d that may set precedents for a future \nU.S. program. The following sections will explore these initiatives. \n3 Voluntary Corporate Initiatives \nSome companies have implemented strategies to prepare for what they believe is an \ninevitable carbon constraint. In part, these strategies are designed to mitigate the risks of future \ncarbon legislation. However, some companies have also staked out positions that they hope will \ninfluence potential future mandatory programs. This section will:  \n  Summarize the literature on why companies may voluntarily take environmental \nactions; \n  Review company efforts on climate change; and  \n  Discuss the implications of voluntary corporate actions on the design of a future \ngreenhouse gas trading program.  \n3.1 Why Do Companies Take Voluntary Action? \nThere are a variety of reasons that corporations adopt voluntary environmental actions to \naddress greenhouse gas emissions or other environmental issues. Some companies have \nattributed these actions to sustainable development goals or environmental stewardship policies \n(Margolick and Russell 2001). However, it is often difficult to separate these goals from \neconomic motives (Kolk and Pinske 2004).  \nLess controversial is the notion that companies adopt voluntary initiatives to create \nfinancial value in one form or another. Lyon and Maxwell (2004) argue for a political economy \n                                                 \n12 For a more detailed description of the Bush administration climate change plan, see \nhttp://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/02/climatechange.html. \n6 Resources for the Future  Kruger \nframework for understanding corporate voluntary environmental action. In particular, they note \nthat corporations may act in a desire to pre-empt or influence future regulation.13 For example, \nadopting environmental technologies or other strategies ahead of regulatory mandates can signal \nto regulators that these alternatives are practical or relatively cost effective (Lyon and Maxwell \n2004). Reinhardt (1999) describes how this strategy was pursued in the chlorofluorocarbon \n(CFC) manufacturing industry before the adoption of the Montreal Protocol. In other cases, trade \nassociations have sponsored codes of management practices, which are partly intended to \nforestall the imposition of government mandates. For example, Nash and Ehrenfeld (1996) \ndescribe the Responsible Care Program, a voluntary code of management practices set up by the \nU.S. chemical industry that was designed as a voluntary effort to forestall the imposition of \nmandatory regulations on chemical production.  \n3.2 Voluntary Corporate Targets \nA recent study found that as many as many as 60 U.S. corporations have adopted \ncorporate greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets (Hoffman 2005). Some of these companies \nhave participated in one of several partnership programs run by government agencies or non-\ngovernmental organizations (see Table 1). Under many of these programs, companies develop a \ncorporate greenhouse gas inventory and adopt an emission target.14 Some of the partnership \nprograms allow additional flexibility in meeting a target through the use of emissions trading or \nthe purchase of greenhouse gas offsets.  \nCorporate voluntary targets and participation in initiatives run by NGOs or government \nmay have several impacts on future trading programs. First, companies may gain expertise that \nmay be useful in assessing the impact of various regulatory policies on their companies. \nHoffman (2005) finds that some companies have adopted internal emissions trading schemes or \n                                                 \n13 There are also non-political motivations for voluntary corporate actions. Although a full discussion of these \nmotivations is beyond the scope of this paper, drivers of voluntary action described in the literature include: (a) the \ndesire to limit future regulatory risk (Margolick and Russell 2001); (b) the desire to reduce costs through practices \nthat also have environmental benefits (Esty and Porter 1998); (c) desire to differentiate a company or its products on \nan environmental basis (Reinhardt 1998); and (d) the desire to enhance employee morale and motivation (Reinhardt \n2000).  \n14 These targets take different forms. Companies such as U.S. electric power generators American Electric Power \nand Energy have adopted absolute targets based on mass emissions corresponding to a base year (King et al. 2004). \nOther companies, such as Rio Tinto and IBM, have adopted intensity targets, under which they commit to surpass a \nbenchmark of emissions or energy use per unit of production or sales (Margolick and Russell 2001). \n7 Resources for the Future  Kruger \ngreenhouse gas measurement programs to gain expertise that will help them influence future \nnational or international policies. Both British Petroleum (Akhurst et al. 2003) and Shell \n(Margolick and Russell 2001) have cited this experience as helping them gain influence in the \ndesign of the UK and EU trading systems.  \nSecond, some aspects of voluntary corporate targets have implications for how a \ncompany will be affected by a future greenhouse gas cap-and-trade program. For example, fast-\ngrowing companies may be favored by rate-based or intensity targets as opposed to absolute \ntargets based on mass emissions. This type of target may also favor companies with low carbon \nintensities. The type of corporate obligation chosen could also be designed to establish a \nprecedent for a specific allocation methodology, such as a methodology based on historic \nemissions, heat input, or production output. Similarly, the \u201cbaseline protection\u201d offered by \nregistries may imply that a future allowance distribution will be done based on historic emissions \nor an output based methodology rather than through an auction.  \nFinally, to the extent that corporate targets or baselines are measured from specific years, \ncompanies become invested in allocation methodologies or future targets that include these \nyears. For example, in describing its voluntary commitment of a 5% reduction below 2000 \nlevels, the electric power company Cinergy notes: \n\u201cBesides the obvious commodity price risk implicit in our target, we also are \nbearing some risk that our efforts will not be counted within a future regulatory \nregime. If the baseline is established far in the future, man years beyond the year \n2000, with a specific provision to disallow early reductions, we would find that \nwe had implemented our program too early. We believe this is unlikely, though it \nremains a risk.\u201d (Cinergy 2004)15\n3.2.1 Chicago Climate Exchange \nThe corporate initiative most directly influenced by the SO2 trading experience and most \nopen about influencing a future climate regime is the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX). For \nmore information on CCX and other programs see Table 1. Richard Sandor, the president of the \nCCX, has invoked the SO2 experience as a model \u201cfor the design of key elements\u201d of the \nprogram (Sandor 2002). One of the key program goals of CCX is to give companies experience \n                                                 \n15 Cinergy has recently announced a plan to merge with Duke Energy, which declared its support for a carbon tax in \nApril 2005 (Borska 2005).  \n8 Resources for the Future  Kruger \nwith the mechanics and methodologies that will be necessary for the greenhouse gas market. \nSandor (2002) also emphasizes the goal of influencing future legislation, noting that \u201ca variety of \nlegislative proposals have provided further indication that participation in CCX will help position \nparticipants to intelligently influence and benefit from possible future regulations.\u201d Similarly, an \nofficial from American Electric Power, a participant in CCX, has noted that one of the \nmotivations for participation in the voluntary program is the company\u2019s interest in the \ndevelopment and use of greenhouse gas offsets or \u201coff-system\u201d reductions (Braine 2004). A \nreport by independent directors of AEP notes that the company\u2019s participation in CCX and other \nvoluntary efforts have given it important experience in the design of potential future regulatory \nprograms. The report finds that \n  \u201cthe company is particularly well positioned to build on this experience to \nadvocate effectively in policy and regulatory forums for the most efficient \nprogram designs, not only for the environmental benefits, but also for the benefits \nto its customers over the long-term.\u201d (AEP 2004) \n4 State Initiatives \nOver the past few years, there has been an explosion in state programs that address \nemissions from greenhouse gases (Rabe 2004, McKinstry 2004). These programs run the gamut \nfrom renewable energy portfolio standards in more than a dozen states to a proposed CO2 \nemissions standard for automobiles in California. However, one of the most widespread \ncategories of state activities are programs to measure, report, register, and, in some cases, trade \ngreenhouse gas emissions. These programs raise questions about whether they will build \nintuitions and set precedents that are helpful or harmful to future national efforts. This section \nwill examine the motivations behind these state programs and explore the challenges and \nopportunities they pose.  \n4.1 Why Do States Take Voluntary Action? \nThere is extensive literature debating the appropriate level of government to address \nenvironmental problems. Although a full discussion of these issues\u2014usually referred to as \nEnvironmental Federalism\u2014is beyond the scope of this paper, much of the debate centers on \nweighing consistency and competitiveness issues that might arise from different environmental \nstandards in different jurisdictions against the benefits of more localized decision making on \nenvironmental issues (Oates 2001, Revesz 2001). Authors have also highlighted the influence \n9 Resources for the Future  Kruger \nthat state governments in the United States have had on national policy by experimenting with \ninnovative initiatives (Oates 2001, McKinstry 2004, Vogel et al. 2005). \nAdditional issues arise for state climate change policies because of the global nature of \nthe problem. First, although states or regional governments may adopt emission reduction \nprograms to address \u201ctheir share\u201d of the global problem, their efforts may be futile if other states \nor national governments avoid emission reductions. Similarly, the public within these states may \nbe concerned that non-participating states are \u201cfree riders\u201d who benefit from the actions of the \nparticipating areas without paying the costs (Kousky and Schneider 2003). Second, state actions \nraise the potential problem of \u201cleakage\u201d if mandatory requirements in one jurisdiction cause a \nshift in economic activity and emissions to another jurisdiction without mandatory requirements \n(Keeler 2004, Kruger and Pizer 2005). For example, limits on power plants emissions in one \nstate or region may simply shift power generation to other regions of the country. Finally, Keeler \n(2004) notes that solutions developed at the state or local level may not create the institutions \nnecessary for a robust national trading program. \nNevertheless, states have cited a number of reasons for developing greenhouse gas \nprograms. Many of these reasons are relevant to the registry or emissions trading initiatives that \nhave proliferated. First, some states have adopted programs to address public or other \nstakeholder concerns about the impacts of climate change (Rabe 2004). Second, states have \nexpressed a desire to influence national policy or regulations in ways that benefit their companies \nor other stakeholders. For example, Rabe (2004) argues that some U.S. states enacted greenhouse \ngas policies to facilitate recognition of emission reductions by companies in the event of future \nnational regulations. Finally, some states have developed these programs to spur innovative \ntechnologies, encourage economic development benefits, or create environmental co-benefits \n(Peterson 2004). \n4.2 State Greenhouse Gas Trading Programs \n4.2.1 Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) \n  One of the most significant state climate programs is an effort by nine states in the \nnortheastern and Mid-Atlantic United States that have joined together to develop a regional cap-\nand-trade program. This program, known as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), \nwas launched in April 2003 when New York Governor George Pataki sent a letter proposing a \nregional emissions trading program to fellow governors. Initially, the program will address \ncarbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the electric power sector. However, the program may be \n10 Resources for the Future  Kruger \nexpanded to include additional sectors and greenhouse gases (GHGs). Advocates of the RGGI \napproach argue that the program could serve as a model for a future national cap-and-trade \nprogram for GHGs. \n  Organizers of RGGI have noted that the program will build upon past models of successful \ntrading programs.16 Although this includes the SO2 program, RGGI is perhaps more similar to \nthe OTC NOx budget program, which was itself highly influenced by the national SO2 trading \nprogram (Kruger and Pizer 2004, WRI 2005). Both the OTC and RGGI programs depend upon \nan innovative collaboration between states that voluntarily adopt model rules that allow the states \nto have the compatible features necessary for an emissions trading program. Although many of \nthe details of RGGI are still in flux, the fundamentals will likely be very similar to past trading \nprograms in the electric power sector. However, the RGGI program may experiment with some \nadditional features that may be useful for a future greenhouse gas emissions trading program. \nSome of these features are discussed below. \n4.2.1.1 Emissions Allowance Distribution \nThe distribution of allowances is one of the most contentious issues faced by \npolicymakers when they design a cap-and-trade program. Allowances are a valuable asset, and \nthe distribution of this asset has significant implications. Even with a modest target, the value of \nallowances in a national greenhouse gas trading program could be an order of magnitude (or \nmore) larger than the value of allowances in the SO2 trading program. Thus, allowance \ndistribution for a national program will raise significant equity issues. RGGI could offer the \nopportunity to try out features at the state or regional level, such as auctioning portions of the \nannual allocations or allocating some allowances directly to groups that are disproportionately \naffected by the costs of a cap-and-trade program. These types of approaches could be \ncomponents of a future national program.  \n4.2.1.2 Development of an Effective Offset Program \n Greenhouse gas offsets could be a particularly cost-effective way to reduce the costs of a \nmandatory greenhouse gas program. Unfortunately, there are no effective models for offset \nprograms to draw upon. Although project-based emissions offset programs for conventional \n                                                 \n16 RGGI organizers have made building on past successful trading programs one of their \u201cguiding principles.\u201d See \nhttp://www.rggi.org/goals.htm.  \n11 Resources for the Future  Kruger \npollutants have been around for many years, many of these programs have had limited \neffectiveness because of high transaction costs and uncertain environmental integrity (Swift \n2002). More recently, the process set up to implement the Clean Development Mechanism, the \nKyoto Protocols project-level offset provision, has been costly and cumbersome (Jepma 2005). If \nstates could advance an environmentally credible model with low transaction costs, it would be a \nsignificant contribution to a future national program. To this end, there have been discussions by \nthe RGGI staff working group and their stakeholders about developing performance standards \nand other objective criteria that would provide clear signals to investors about the types of \nprojects that would be acceptable (Sherry 2004). \n4.2.1.3 International Linkages \n The launch of RGGI has sparked great interest in Europe, where, as will be discussed \nlater, an even larger experiment with greenhouse gas trading began on January 1, 2005. There \nhave been informal contacts between state officials and officials of the European Commission \nand European member states to share information on how the new European Union Emissions \nTrading System (EU ETS) is developing. Contacts between the EU and states may provide \nopportunities to explore a number of \u201clinking issues\u201d that will be useful for any future GHG \nprogram (Fontaine 2005). RGGI states are also considering whether to accept EU ETS \nallowances and Clean Development Mechanism credits (Sherry 2005).  \n4.2.2 West Coast Trading Initiatives \n  Three western states\u2014California, Washington, and Oregon\u2014have launched an initiative to \ndevelop a coordinated greenhouse gas reporting system (Rabe 2004, Pew Center 2004). These \nstates have also indicated that they may consider a trading system. A staff report released in \nNovember 2004 recommended that the governors of the three states consider a regional market-\nbased carbon allowance program (WCGGI 2004).  \n  West Coast states may develop a different model for a cap-and-trade program than has \nbeen developed by RGGI. Concerns about addressing imports of power from outside the state \nhave led some stakeholders to advocate design approaches that focus on the distribution of \nelectric power rather than generation. For example, an advisory group to the governor of Oregon \nhas recommended a tradable carbon content standard for power consumed in the state, which \nwould take power imports into account. (Governors Advisory Group 2004). California is \nconsidering a proposal to allocate allowances to load-serving entities, which would be required \nto hold allowances to cover the emissions of the electric power they distribute (CCAP 2005). \n12 Resources for the Future  Kruger \n4.2.3 Registries as a Building Block for Trading? \nMore than ten states have adopted or are in the process of adopting voluntary registries \nfor greenhouse gas emissions (PPI 2003).17 Registries are electronic databases that track \nemission reductions by companies or other organizations. Under some of these programs, \ncompanies report their corporate-wide emissions and establish a baseline against which future \ncorporate emission reductions can be counted. In other registry programs, companies may simply \nreport specific emission reduction actions without reporting their overall corporate-wide \nemissions. Voluntary registries have a number of benefits, including helping corporations \nunderstand the scope of their emissions and possible mitigation measures that they might take. \nRegistries may also raise awareness of the climate change issue and highlight the actions of \ncompanies that are leaders in reducing their emissions.  \nSome analysts have touted voluntary registries as an important building block for a future \nmandatory emissions trading program (PPI 2003). However, several aspects of voluntary \nregistries may complicate the development of a future emissions trading program. First, there is \nan inherent contradiction in voluntary registries because these programs must balance the desire \nto encourage participation with the costs associated with a rigorous emissions reporting program. \nIf measurement and reporting requirements are too rigorous and costly, there will be few \nparticipants. Conversely, if program reporting restrictions are too lenient, the resulting data may \nnot be an appropriate foundation for a future mandatory program. Second, most voluntary \nregistries require reporting at the company-wide level rather than the facility level. While this is \nappropriate for a voluntary program that tracks a corporate emissions goal, it is less useful for a \nsector-wide or economy-wide mandatory trading program, where it is important to carefully \ntrack emissions at the facility level. Third, the promise of \u201ccredit\u201d for early reductions, while \npotentially desirable for encouraging early action and building support for an eventual mandatory \nprogram, also raises a variety of complicated issues. These types of programs raise questions \nabout whether they are awarding credits to actions that would have happened anyway as a result \nof business-as-usual activities (Parry and Toman 2002). Moreover, as discussed earlier, \u201cbaseline \nprotection\u201d programs may imply certain methodologies for future distribution of allowances \nunder a mandatory program.  \n                                                 \n17 There is also a national registry set up under section 1605(b) of the Energy Policy Act. See \nhttp://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/1605/frntvrgg.html. \n13 Resources for the Future  Kruger \n5 The European Union Emissions Trading System \nUndoubtedly, the most important development in emissions trading since the landmark \nSO2 trading program has been the launch of the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU \nETS) on January 1, 2005. EU officials and others have noted the influence of the SO2 program \non the EU ETS (Dimas 2005, Delbeke 2003, Zapfel and Vainio 2002, Christiansen and \nWettestad 2003). Nevertheless, the EU ETS dwarfs existing U.S. trading programs in size and \ncomplexity (see Table 2), and the EU views its trading program as \u201cshaping the future debate\u201d \nover the use of emissions trading for climate policy (EC 2004a). The EU program encompasses a \nvariety of new features and will experiment with a more decentralized approach to linking \nprograms in the different EU Member States. It is also the flagship program in Europe\u2019s efforts \nto meet requirements of the Kyoto protocol. As such, it has been both driven forward by the \nKyoto mandate as well as burdened by some of the less desirable features of this international \nagreement. Potentially influential features of the EU ETS are discussed below. \n5.1 Participation by New Sectors \nThe EU program incorporates a broader variety of industrial sectors than previous trading \nprograms. For example, the program includes cement, lime, ceramics, and glass facilities, \nsources in the pulp and paper sector, and sources in the metal ore and iron and steel industry. \nAlthough U.S. NOx programs have included some industrial sources, the scope and number of \nsources outside of the electric power sectors in the EU ETS are far greater. Inclusion of these \nsources has required the development of new emissions measurement protocols and may foster \nthe development of additional options to reduce emissions. Moreover, the participation by \nofficials from companies outside of the electric power sector, which is relatively experienced \nwith energy trading in many companies, will shed light on how different corporate cultures adapt \nto the new organizational issues posed by emissions trading programs (Kruger 2005).  \n5.2 Flexible Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification \nThe European Union\u2019s emissions monitoring, reporting, and verification system is less \nprescriptive than systems used in U.S. trading programs (Kruger 2005). The guidelines spell out \ndifferent \u201ctiers\u201d of methodologies with different degrees of assumed accuracy. Firms propose \ninstallation-specific methodologies to the relevant authority in each Member State. Installations \nare assumed to use the top tiers, but they may petition to use lower-tiered methods with lower \nassumed accuracy if they show that a methodology is impractical or cannot be achieved at \n14 Resources for the Future  Kruger \nreasonable cost. Each member state has the autonomy to grant waivers from use of the top-tier \nmethods (EC 2004b).  \nSecond, in contrast to the U.S. trading systems, Member State authorities may require \ncompanies to use private, third-party verifiers. Third-party verification may reduce government \ncosts while providing valuable technical expertise to some Member State authorities. \nNevertheless, the use of third-party verification for a cap-and-trade program raises several \nquestions, including whether third-party verifiers will provide sufficient consistency in their \ninterpretations of the monitoring guidelines.18  \n5.2.1 Decentralized Approach \nThe preceding discussion of monitoring and verification illustrates how some of the \nfeatures that have been decided centrally within the federal U.S. SO2 trading program and the \nmulti-jurisdictional U.S. NOx programs are decentralized within the EU system. While absolute \nstandardization is not feasible or necessary, it is an open question whether the EU ETS model \nstrikes the right balance between consistency and national sovereignty. For example, if firms in \ndifferent Member States face significantly different compliance and enforcement regimes, will \nthere be different gaming responses that undermine both the environmental credibility and the \nefficiency of the trading system? This may be a particularly critical question in Member States \nwith historically weak environmental institutions, such as new EU members from former Soviet-\nbloc countries or some Member States in Southern Europe.19  \nUltimately, questions of standardization in the design and operation of emissions trading \nsystems are applicable beyond the EU. To the extent that future climate regimes link different \ndomestic trading systems, similar issues are likely to arise. Thus, the balance between centralized \nand decentralized features in the EU system should be closely evaluated during the pilot phase of \nthe program.  \n                                                 \n18 A more extensive discussion of these issues appears in Kruger and Pizer 2004 and Kruger 2005. \n19 For example, Blackman and Harrington (2000) have described some of the difficulties Poland has had with \nenforcing its emissions fee system. Tabara (2003) argues that Spain\u2019s environmental administrative capacity has not \nalways been adequate to face complex problems such as climate change. \n \n15 Resources for the Future  Kruger \n5.3 Uncertainties within the EU ETS \nWhile the EU system blazes new territory in many areas and provides important \nexperience, it also faces a number of challenges. Many of these challenges are byproducts of \nuncertainties and flaws in the Kyoto agreement. For example, banking between the first and \nsecond phases of the program is not mandatory, and Member States have generally restricted \nbanking out of concern that use of banked allowances may make it more difficult to meet the \ntarget in the first Kyoto compliance period. The lack of banking may undermine longer-term \nmitigation plans because firms have little incentive to implement strategies that create extra \nemissions reductions beyond their allocated levels. The inability to bank these \u201cearly reductions\u201d \ncould be a significant disincentive if prices are low in the first period and high in the second.  \nA more fundamental difficulty raised by the Kyoto process is uncertainty about the form \nand level of international commitment beyond 2012. This will constrain EU Member States in \nplanning for the next phase of the EU ETS. It also makes it difficult for European industry to \ntake a long-term approach to investing in climate-friendly technologies and to planning a least-\ncost, longer-term strategy for GHG abatement. Moreover, although banking will be available \nbetween the second period and subsequent periods, uncertainty over the structure of a future \ninternational regime could make Member States and their industries reluctant to make the \ninvestment decisions that would enable them to take advantage of a banking provision.  \nThere is also uncertainty associated with EU ETS linkage to project-level offset \nprovisions of the Kyoto agreement. As noted above, utilizing low-cost emission reductions in \ndeveloping countries could be a critical component of cost-effective greenhouse gas trading \nprogram. In fact, analysis of EU ETS Member State National Allocation Plans shows that there \nwill be considerable reliance on project-level offsets in many EU Member States (Zetterberg et \nal. 2004). Unfortunately, the provision for project-level offsets in developing countries, the Clean \nDevelopment Mechanism (CDM), has been marked by problematic implementation and delays \n(Jepma 2005). It is not clear that the process to review and approve CDM projects will be \ncapable of handling the necessary number of projects to meet worldwide demand for CDM \ncredits (Kruger and Pizer 2004).  \n6 Conclusions \nFew would have predicted the impact of the U.S. Acid Rain Program\u2019s experiment on \nemissions trading. The SO2 trading model has influenced the development of the international \n16 Resources for the Future  Kruger \nemissions trading regime under the Kyoto Protocol, and emissions trading has become the \nprimary policy instrument for addressing greenhouse gases. At the same time, the SO2 program \nhas provided a useful benchmark as policy analysts have considered what different or additional \nfeatures might be necessary for a greenhouse gas trading program. As discussed earlier, many of \nthese features have now been incorporated into legislative and policy proposals. However, with \nlittle likelihood of quick federal action on greenhouse gas trading in the United States, the actors \ndiscussed in this paper are filling the vacuum by testing approaches and staking out positions that \nwill likely have an important influence on future efforts on greenhouse gas trading.  \nWhat are the implications of these initiatives for a future U.S. national program? First, \nthese programs offer opportunities to experiment with some of the mechanisms that will be \nneeded as we advance from the relatively simple SO2 trading model to a much more complex \ngreenhouse gas model. For example, experiments with new offset and emissions reporting \nmethodologies for non-CO2 gases under state and company initiatives could provide valuable \ninsights. Similarly, exploration of new allowance distribution methodologies under the RGGI \ninitiative offers the opportunity to improve understanding of the distributive issues associated \nwith allowance distribution. Finally, experience with linking domestic programs in the European \nUnion and with linking the EU ETS to project-level offsets under the CDM could be fruitful for \nexploring certain aspects of the architecture of future international agreements. \nThe three initiatives discussed have been less trailblazing in addressing some of the other \ndesign features that are unique to greenhouse gas trading. For example, although the EU ETS \ncovers a broader array of sectors, it still covers less than half of Europe\u2019s CO2 emissions. In \nparticular, it does not include emissions from the fast-growing transportation sector, and it is \nreportedly unlikely that new sectors will be added in the second phase of the program (Carbon \nMarket Europe 2005). There has also been no experimentation with cost-limiting mechanisms \nsuch as the safety valve.20\nSecond, efforts to stake out potential design elements such as target types and allocation \nmethodologies will likely grow as more companies begin to believe that a carbon constraint is \ninevitable. Whereas allowance allocation was a relatively new phenomenon when the Clean Air \nAct Amendments were passed in 1990, U.S. companies now have more understanding of the \n                                                 \n20The one exception is Canada, which has proposed a safety-valve mechanism for its domestic emissions trading \nprogram. See Government of Canada 2002. \n17 Resources for the Future  Kruger \nfinancial implications of these methodologies. The desire to influence future allowance \nallocations by establishing early reductions or signaling future allocation methodologies could \nbuild political support for an eventual mandatory program. On the other hand, the establishment \nof competing claims on allowances could also complicate the eventual development of such a \nprogram and could make it less likely that mechanisms such as auctions will be utilized.  \nThird, some have argued that the proliferation of state approaches to registries or trading \nmay hasten the advent of a national program by creating a \u201cpatchwork\u201d of state programs that \ncries out for federal harmonization.21 However, with an issue as controversial as climate change \npolicy, there is also a danger with this approach. Just as an early experiment with electricity \nrestructuring in California may be one of the factors that has derailed momentum for national \nrestructuring legislation (Joskow 2003), unsuccessful attempts by states on greenhouse gas \ntrading could give ammunition to opponents of a national program. While experimentation at the \nstate level is healthy and useful, these experiments must be successful to prove the concept for a \nnational approach.  \nGiven its size and visibility, the perceived success or failure of the EU ETS is even more \nsignificant. The degree to which it succeeds or fails is likely to influence deeply any future \ninternational attempt to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the climate change that they cause. \nMoreover, if the EU trading program can demonstrate relatively low allowance prices and \neffective institutions for ensuring credible emission reductions, it will be more likely that the \nUnited States will adopt a program sooner rather than later. Conversely, if the EU program is \nviewed as excessively costly or ineffective, it will be a longer road from SO2 to greenhouse gas \ntrading in the United States. \n                                                 \n21 For a discussion of this political dynamic, see Swanson 2004 and Lee 2003.  \n18 Resources for the Future  Kruger \nTables \nTable 1: Government and Private Programs for Emission Reduction and \nReporting \nChicago Climate Exchange: The Chicago climate exchange is a greenhouse gas emissions \nreduction and trading pilot program for emissions sources and offset projects in the United \nStates, Canada, and Mexico.

When the sun\u2019s energy reaches Earth, the \natmosphere absorbs some of it on the way down, and plants absorb some of it for \nphotosynthesis. Some of the remaining energy heats the earth\u2019s surface. The heated \ncrust of the earth then radiates energy, which the atmospheric gases absorb during the \nday. This trapped energy heats the atmosphere, increasing the overall temperature of \nthe planet and distributing warmth to its night side, when solar heating is unavailable. \nThe denser the concentration of heat-absorbing gases and molecules in the atmosphere \nlike water vapor, methane and carbon dioxide, the more energy the atmosphere retains \nas it passes through. \n \nProcedure: \n\uf0b7 As a student team, decide on how you are going to demonstrate what happens \nto temperature if there is an increase in CO2 in the atmosphere. You must have a \ncontrol as part of your experiment. Each team receives 2-4 pop bottles.   \n\uf0b7 Prepare the number of greenhouses you will be using for your experiment. Cut \nthe top third of the pop bottle off and save, as you will eventually replace this to \nform an airtight greenhouse setting. \n\uf0b7 Bottle 1 will have water; bottle 2 will have water and Alka-Seltzer. If you do a \n3rd and/or 4th bottle, the decision is yours. You may select from any of the \nsupplies on the supply table to conduct additional experiments. \n\uf0b7 Tape a thermometer inside the pop bottle. This needs to be high enough in the \nbottle not to come in contact with the water and low enough that the top third \ncan be replaced. Use packing tape to hold the thermometer in place. \n\uf0b7 Fill bottles 1 & 2 with the same amount of water, approximately 2-3 ml. Replace \nthe tops and tape them securely. \n\uf0b7 Place the bottles under a grow light or a heat lamp, which serves as an energy \nsource. A heat lamp may expedite the reaction inside the bottles. Make sure that \nthe control and experimental bottles receive equal amount of energy. \n\uf0b7 Record the initial temperature of each bottle. \n\uf0b7 Add your Alka-Seltzer to bottle 2.   \n\uf0b7 On the data table provided, record the temperature of each bottle every minute \nfor a ten-minute period. \n\uf0b7 Clean up your work area. \n\uf0b7 We will use Excel or an on-line graphing tool to chart the data collected. \ni-LEARN TEACHING RESOURCES \n21 | P a g e  \n \n\uf0b7 (Optional) Have students research what areas of the United States have more \ncarbon dioxide emissions and/or have students research what areas of the world \nhave more carbon dioxide emissions. \n\uf0b7 Graph your data using Excel or an on-line graphing tool. \n\uf0b7 Complete a 3-2-1 exit ticket on what was learned during the experiment. \n \nExtensions:  \nResearch to find where CO2 emissions are higher. This could be limited to the United \nStates, or done worldwide. \n \nTeacher Notes:   \n \nEncourage students to do a third and/or fourth set up. Encourage students to be \ncreative in their lab set-ups. \n \nOne factor that might affect the outcome of demonstration is the temperature of the \ntable the experiment is being conducted. Simple cardboard insulation between the \nbottle and the table is recommended.   \n \nAssessment: \nDiscussion questions: \n \n1. What greenhouse saw the greatest change in temperature?  Why did this \nhappen? \n2. What greenhouse saw the least change in temperature?  Why did this happen? \n3. How do greenhouse gases affect us? Other living components? \n4. How are greenhouse gases affecting the earth\u2019s temperature? \n5. Do our human activities affect the amount of greenhouse gases? \n6. What can we do to slow down greenhouse gases? \n7. Can we slow down greenhouse gases too much?   \n8. Is there a necessary level of greenhouse gases that are needed? \n9. Are greenhouse gases higher in some parts of the United States than others? In \nother parts of the world?  \n10. How would you modify the experimental design if you were to show that \nplants can lower the greenhouse effects? \n \nReferences: \ni-LEARN TEACHING RESOURCES \n22 | P a g e  \n \n\u25cf https://scied.ucar.edu/teaching-box/greenhouse-effect \n\u25cf https://www.nationalgeographic.org/education/programs/geo-inquiry/ \n \n \n \nAcknowledgement: The iLEARN project is supported by USDA-AFRI (Award # 2017-\n68010-25956).
