Lao PDR is landlocked\nwhile Cambodia borders the Gulf of\nThailand and Viet Nam borders the\nSouth China Sea.

Following the Philippines in\nterms of the number of disasters are\nIndonesia, Viet Nam, Cambodia, and Lao PDR\nin that order. Indonesia actually had less\ndisasters compared to Viet Nam in the 1990s\nbut more in the 2000s. Of the countries, only\nLao PDR had fewer disasters in the 2000s\nthan in the 1990s. On the whole for the five\ncountries, the number of disasters was higher\nin the 2000s at 320 than in the 1990s at 195,\nindicating the increase in the occurrence of\ndisasters in the last two decades.\nMost of the natural disasters in Cambodia, Lao\nPDR, and Viet Nam, countries which are\ntraversed by the Mekong River, were floods\nbrought about by storms and occasional\ntyphoons. In Indonesia, the disasters included\nfloods, landslides, drought, and forest fires.\nMeanwhile, about 15\u201320 typhoons occurred in\nthe Philippines every year which brought\nabout major floods, landslides, and other\nrelated disasters. As earlier indicated, some of\nthe typhoons that originated in the\nPhilippines also travelled westward\nto Viet Nam, Cambodia, and Lao\nPDR. A few typhoons also reached\nother neighboring countries like\nJapan, China, and Taiwan,\nsometimes bringing significant\ndestruction in these countries.\nPeople affected by natural\ndisasters\nDuring the 1990s and 2000s, the\nnumber of people affected by\nnatural disasters in the five countries has\nbeen substantial as can be seen in Table 3.\nFollowing the pattern of occurrence of natural\ndisasters, the Philippines had the most\nnumber of people affected, increasing from\n35.2 million in the 1990s to 49.8 million in\nthe 2000s for a total of 85 million or an\naverage of 4.3 million yearly for the past two\ndecades. The Philippines was followed by Viet\nNam, Cambodia, Indonesia, and Lao PDR in\nthat order. Cambodia, the Philippines, and\nViet Nam had more people affected by natural\ndisasters in the 2000s than in the 1990s\nwhile the reverse was true for Indonesia and\nLao PDR. For all of the five countries, the\nnumber of people affected by natural\ndisasters was higher in the 2000s at 84.3\nmillion than in the 1990s at 69.5 million,\nindicating the increasing number of people\naffected during the past two decades.\nSocioeconomic damages due to\nnatural disasters\nIsrael, in an earlier paper (2010), presented\nthe various social and economic sectors in a\nTable 3.

He pointed out that there are\nboth direct and indirect damages brought\nabout by natural disasters. The secondary\ndata on the value of socioeconomic damages\npresented in Table 4, however, reflect only\ndirect damages but not indirect damages.\nThus, these figures on socioeconomic damages\ncan be considered conservative estimates as\nthey are only a fraction of the value of total\ndamages caused by natural disasters.\nAmong the countries, Indonesia had the\nhighest value of damages at $10,082 million\nin the 1990s and $1,765 million in the 2000s\nfor a total of $11,847 million or an average of\n$592.35 million yearly during the past two\ndecades. The country was followed by Viet\nNam, the Philippines, Cambodia, and Lao PDR\nin that order. Viet Nam had higher\nsocioeconomic damages in the 2000s than in\nthe 1990s while the reverse was true for the\nother four countries. For the five countries,\nthe value of socioeconomic damages was\nhigher in the 1990s at $15,963.2 million than\nin the 2000s at $9,255 million for a total of\n$25,238.2 million in the last two decades.\nSuch figures indicate that while the incidence\nof and number of people affected by natural\ndisasters in totality in the five countries had\nbeen increasing in the last two decades, the\nvalue of socioeconomic damages had been\ndecreasing. This appears to be inconsistent but\nsome explanations can also be put forward.\nFirst, as earlier mentioned, the socioeconomic\ndamages included in the computations are\nonly direct damages of natural disasters. The\ninclusion of all damages could change the\nfigures. Second, the data on socioeconomic\ndamages may be preliminary and need to be\nreviewed given the difficulty of putting\nmoney values on socioeconomic damages.\nBut even with the current results, the\ngenerated values of the socioeconomic\ndamages for the five countries are\nclearly substantial and a real\ncause of concern. Still,\nrecomputation of the\nsocioeconomic damages is in order\nwhen more accurate data and\ninformation become available.\nBenefits from NMHS\nimprovements and\ncooperation\nAn important way of reducing the\nnegative impacts of natural\nTable 4.

In this regard,\nimprovements in the existing\nnational meteorological and\nhydrological services (NMHS) of\na country may be needed.\nRecent studies have indicated\nthat investments of a country in\nNMHS would result to very low\ncost-benefit (C/B) ratios or high\nB/C ratios. The specific benefits\nfrom NMHS improvements are\nitemized by sector/industry in\nTable 5.\nFurthermore, since some types of natural\nhazards such as typhoons and droughts have\ntransboundary implications, it would serve\nwell for governments, particularly those of\nCambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, the\nPhilippines, and Viet Nam to cooperate and\ncoordinate with each other and come up with\na subregional integrated approach for weather\nand climate-related forecasting.\nRecommendations\nOver and above what has been undertaken for\nthe forecasting of natural hazards and\ndisasters at the level of the Association of\nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Cambodia,\nIndonesia, Lao PDR, the Philippines, and Viet\nNam may undertake further common\ninitiatives to strengthen their capabilities for\nthe purpose.

Our focus here is on an initial application of our method in southern \nOregon, United States. \n \nIntroduction \n \nAt present, one of the most widely applied approaches for assessing physical vulnerability to coastal hazards is \nbased on the probability of backshore properties being exceeded by the one percent annual chance total water level \n(also known as the 100-year flood).  Since FEMA\u2019s National Flood Insurance Rate Maps are developed using this \ntechnique, many communities use this as the basis for determining coastal management plans.  However, this \napproach, taken in isolation, is limited in that it does not address long-term trends or the impacts of a variable \nclimate, possibly leaving many communities at risk.     \n \nThe majority of the existing literature on developing physical coastal vulnerability assessments characterizes hazards \non an individual basis (Ferreira et al., 2006).  However, recent work reveals a shift toward a more integrated \napproach of evaluating multiple hazards simultaneously.  Mendoza et al. (2008) take a multi-hazard approach of \nexamining the impacts of both flooding and coastal change at a time scale of a single event.  Ferreira et al. (2006) \nexamine the response of shoreline change rates to both individual storm impacts and long-term trends, generating a \nmultiple time scale, single hazard approach.  An understanding of the relative importance of these multiple hazards \noccurring on various time scales and their inclusion in methodologies to assess the vulnerability of coastal \ncommunities and ecosystems is critical for effective, sound management of the coast.  \n \nWithin this context, the objective of this work is to develop a methodology to enhance coastal vulnerability \nassessments by incorporating the impacts of climate change and variability via an integrated multi-scale, multi-\nhazard approach (Figure 1).  Application of this methodology is along a ~90 km stretch of the southern Oregon coast \nbetween Winchester Bay and Port Orford. \n   \nMethodology \n \nAs illustrated in Figure 1, our approach conceptually integrates two coastal hazards (flooding and coastal change) \nover individual storm event and long-term (interannual to decadal) time scales under a variety of climate scenarios.   \n \n  \nFigure 1. Conceptual model showing integration of a varying climate into coastal change and flooding on storm \nevent and long-term timescales. \n \nFlooding: Individual Events \n \nThe total water level (TWL) governed by hydrodynamic forcing conditions and foreshore beach slope and relative to \nthe elevation of backshore geomorphic features is critical to assessing the occurrence of flooding on beaches. For \nour Southern Oregon application we developed a 30-year hourly wave and water level time series (1979-2008) using \na combination of measured and hindcast wave data and corresponding tide levels recorded by the Charleston tide \ngauge (Figure 2). The hourly two percent exceedance wave run-up values (Stockdon et al., 2007) were calculated \nusing the wave data and beach slopes derived from 2008 Lidar data (Figures 2B, C, and D), which were then added \nto the hourly tide levels to produce a 30-year total water level (TWL) time series. The 2008 Lidar data was also used \nto determine other morphological parameters including the dune crest/bluff top and beach/dune juncture. \n \nOne approach to assess the vulnerability posed by flooding is to examine the number of hours per year the backshore \ndune crests are met or exceeded by the TWL (Figure 2F)  Another, more traditional, approach is to examine 100-\nyear TWL elevations (calculated using a peak-over-threshold (POT) extreme value theory approach) and assess \nspatially where these extreme TWL values exceed the dune crests (Figure 2G).  This approach provides a means of \ndetermining the potential extent of flooding caused by extreme storms.  \n \n  \nFigure 2. Panels A-D show the physical setting of the study region. Alongshore variability of existing conditions and \nfuture estimated changes are shown in Panels E-H.  Black lines correspond with initial conditions while dark gray \nand light gray correspond with the 30 and 90 year scenarios respectively.  \nFlooding: Long-term Trends  \n \nBoth sea level rise and increasing storminess have the potential to exacerbate the extent of vulnerable stretches of \ncoast.  Here we incorporate these two climate controlled factors into projections of TWLs along our study area 30 \nand 90 years into the future.  Using the empirically derived global sea level rise (SLR) predictions in Rahmstorf et \nal., 2007, we examine the impacts (Table 1) of three SLR scenarios (using rates from models projecting low (L) \nrates of SLR, average (M) SLR rates and high (H) SLR rates) for each of the time frames mentioned above on \ncoastal vulnerability to flood hazards. We crudely estimate local land level changes along the southern Oregon coast \n(1.7 mm/yr) by subtracting the local sea level rise rate recorded at the Charleston tide gauge (1.3 mm/yr) from the \npresent eustatic rate (3 mm/yr).  We assume that land level changes will remain constant for all scenarios and simply \nsubtract them from the projected accelerations in rate of global sea level.  The potential for increasing storminess is \naccounted for by incorporating the existing trend in winter wave heights offshore of Oregon of ~ 0.016m/year \n(Ruggiero et al., 2010) into projected future TWL time series created using the same approach described in the \nindividual event scale flooding methodology. It should be noted that the increase in winter wave heights was only \napplied for the first 30 years of each new time series. Projecting the future wave climate beyond this time scale is \nunrealistic.  Figure 2F-G shows the results of expected changes for the medium sea level rise scenario in 2040 and \n2100.  \n \n 2040 2100 \nL M H L M H \n% increase in 100 yr TWL 9 10 11 13 18 24 \n  \n% increase in Hrs of overtopping \nper year 19 46 53 126 291 615 \n% increase in Hrs of impact per \nyear 10 21 23 49 103 212 \n% increase in Dune erosion \n \n23 27 28  37 56 92 \nTable 1. Average percent increases of change are shown for three estimated climate change scenarios (high, \nmedium, and low) in 2040 and 2100.  Alongshore variability of bolded medium scenarios is plotted in Figure 2F-H. \n \nCoastal Change: Individual Events \n \nStorms are often responsible for dramatic coastal change and therefore, quantifying dune response to these events is \ncritical for vulnerability assessments.  Several numerical models exist to forecast beach and dune changes to large \nstorms.  However, these models can be complex and often computationally intensive.  Therefore, we utilized the \nsimple geometric foredune erosion model of Komar et al. (1999).  Using the difference between TWL and dune toe \nelevations, and dividing by the beach slope, this model estimates the maximum expected horizontal dune erosion \n(Figure 2H). \n \nCoastal Change: Long-term Trends \n \nWhile episodic events can drastically alter coastlines on short time scales, it is ultimately long-term trends that \ndetermine a region\u2019s evolving susceptibility to hazards.  It is therefore important to include these long-term \nobservations into vulnerability assessments.  This study incorporates \u2018short-term\u2019 shoreline change rates computed \nbetween 1967 and 2002 using the end-point method (Figure 2E).  Without sophisticated shoreline change modeling \nor sediment budget development, shoreline change rates could conceptually be extrapolated into the future (not \nshown), providing additional estimates of how long-term trends impact relative vulnerability. \n \nSummary \n \nCoastal decision makers are presently operating without sufficient quantitative information regarding the impact \nposed by a changing climate to the vulnerability of both infrastructure and ecosystems.  Typical approaches to \nassessing vulnerability to coastal natural hazards do not account for the effects of long term trends and may leave \nmany regions of the coast overly vulnerable. \n \nThe analysis described above quantifies coastal vulnerability based on two hazards (flooding and erosion) at \nindividual events and long-term time scales.  While these individual components are useful for understanding \ncontributing factors to vulnerable areas, when combined (ideally probabilistically) they provide a quantitative \nmethodology to assess coastal vulnerability in the face of a changing climate using a multi-hazard, multi-time scale \napproach.   \n \nReferences \n \nFerriera, O., Garcia, T., Matias, A., Taborda, R., and Dias, J.A.,, 2006.

Covering four sites (one \neach in Indonesia and Vietnam) and two sites in the Philippines, \nthe study documented the impacts of three climate hazards \naffecting coastal communities, namely typhoon/flooding, coastal \nerosion and saltwater intrusion. It also analyzed planned \nadaptation options, which communities and local governments \ncan implement, as well as autonomous responses of households \nto protect and insure themselves from these hazards. It employed \na variety of techniques, ranging from participatory based \napproaches such as community hazard mapping and Focus \nGroup Discussions (FGDs) to regression techniques, to analyze \nthe impact of climate change and the behavior of affected \ncommunities and households.\nResults show that households in coastal communities face a \nconfluence of risks and often adapt simultaneously to these risks. \nThese risks have the most impact on the sources and types of \nlivelihoods of households. Foregone income due to these risks \nwas in fact found to be higher than the value of damages from \nloss of assets including damage to houses. Foregone income in \nthe end affected consumption patterns. Using the Vulnerability \nas Expected Poverty (VEP) as a measure, it was found that the \nincidence of vulnerable households is highest in Palawan, \nPhilippines (56%), followed by Vietnam (46%), Batangas, \nPhilippines (42%) and then Indonesia (35%). The mean \nvulnerability estimate for Palawan is 0.51, which means that \non average the probability that households will fall below the \nminimum consumption level (at which they will be considered \npoor) is 51%. For Vietnam, the mean vulnerability is 0.43, while \nBatangas and Indonesia have mean estimates of 0.38 and 0.37, \nrespectively.\nVarious planned adaptation options, which communities and \nlocal governments can implement, were studied using cost \neffectiveness analysis. A consistent and common result across \nthree sites is that ecosystem-based approaches (or natural \nbarriers such as mangroves) are more cost effective than hard \ninfrastructure investments. There also seem to be a preponderance\nof protective measures when, in fact, the main impact or risk from \nthese hazards is really on the livelihoods of coastal-based \ncommunities. In Batangas, for example, it was found that \nlivelihood diversification is a viable planned adaptation measure.\nFactors that determine autonomous or private responses to \nclimate hazards were also assessed. It was found that there are \ngeographical and spatial differences in adaptation patterns, \nsuggesting that households react rationally to the degree of \nthreats from the hazards. For instance, households near riverbanks \nare more likely to employ autonomous adaptation strategies \nagainst flooding. Evidence was also found that planned adaptation \n\u201ccrowds out\u201d private or autonomous adaptation. Presence of \nnatural barriers such as mangroves and riverbank rehabilitation \nschemes result in less likelihood of autonomous adaptation to \nflooding and saltwater intrusion being pursued. Income from \nexternal sources, such as disaster relief, also tends to crowd out \nautonomous adaptation. Social capital, which was represented \nby the number of people from whom the respondents can turn \nto for loans with some level of certainty, had a positive effect on \nthe likelihood of autonomous adaptation. There was also some \ngender dimension in adaptation. In particular, households with \nmore female members have lower likelihood of pursuing \nautonomous adaptation to flooding and typhoon, but higher \nadaptation to saltwater intrusion. Unfortunately the study did \nnot assess the reasons for this behavior in more detail, as this \nwas not part of the original design.\n1.0 Introduction\nCoastal and marine ecosystems are vital to most Southeast Asian \ncountries primarily because most of the countries in this region \ndepend on fish and other marine products to fuel their economy \nand feed their population. Furthermore, the people living in \ncoastal areas and dependent on this resource base are among the \npoorest in the region. Thus, governments have been concerned \nabout the environmental problems confronting these ecosystems \nand the populations dependent on them.\nWith climate change, coastal ecosystems and associated \npopulations are even more at risk. Most of the attendant effects \nof climate change, like sea level rise (and subsequent salt water \nintrusion) and sea surface temperature rise, emanate from the \nsea. Thus, while environmental externalities have been traced \nfrom the ridge to the reefs in the past, climate change has pushed \nthe need to look at effects from the reefs to the ridge. Coastal \necosystems and the communities dependent on them have in \nfact become more vulnerable, requiring more focused efforts and \npackages of support from government and private sectors alike.\nThere is still a dearth of literature on why some households \nself-protect and self-insure against climate hazards while others \ndo not. What are the determinants of autonomous adaptation? \nAs there is heightened concern on climate change, what are the \npossible interactions between public initiatives and autonomous \ninitiatives? Does the presence of public intervention substitute for \nprivate defense or insurance against climate-related risks?\nWhat complicates the analysis is that hazards are often interrelated \nand occur simultaneously. The study therefore attempted to \nprovide a cross-country comparison on adaptation behaviors and \nto understand this within the unique context of multiple hazards \nthat often confronts households in coastal communities.\nThe study in general assessed public (planned) and private \n(autonomous) adaptation strategies pursued by coastal \ncommunities against multiple climate-related hazards \u2013 to gain a \nbetter understanding of the risks associated with climate change \nand assess adaptation strategies and policy options to address \nthese risks more efficiently. Specifically the objectives of this study \nincluded:\n1. Validating and assessing climate change impacts on  \nselected coastal areas in Indonesia, Philippines and Vietnam;\n2. Identifying vulnerabilities and adaptation strategies of \nhouseholds and communities; \n3. Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of planned adaptation \nstrategies to climate change in selected coastal areas in the \nthree countries; \n4. Exploring and identifying emerging issues in the   \nassessment of vulnerability and economic analysis of \nadaptation; \n5. How climate change policies can be mainstreamed in the \ndevelopment agenda and programs.\nThe study covered four study areas in three Southeast Asian \ncountries significantly affected by climate change (Figure 1).\nTable 1 presents a summary of the specific study sites and partner \ninstitutions in the project areas.\nattributing all damages to SLR can be misleading, as the impact \nof SLR is often magnified by storm surges and typhoons. This \nstudy therefore considered multiple threats from typhoon/flooding, \ncoastal erosion and saltwater intrusion as the primary hazards or \nrisks associated with climate change to which communities and \nhouseholds react and pursue adaptation measures.\nIndividual country studies adopted a common framework in \nanalyzing climate change hazards, vulnerabilities, impacts, and \nadaptation options. Figure 2 illustrates the flow of methodologies \nused to address differences in situations across sites and the \ncommonalities that allowed comparisons and generation of \nlessons learned.\n6\n2.0 Research Methodology\nClimate change in general affects coastal communities through \na rise in sea surface temperature (SST), sea level rise (SLR) and \nchanges in precipitation (both in terms of intensity and pattern). \nAs a consequence water resources, agriculture, human health, \nfisheries, tourism and human settlements in vulnerable areas are \nat risk. This study argues however, that coastal communities face \na confluence of risks. For instance, typhoons result in both \ninundation and coastal erosion. Thus focusing on SLR alone and Figure 2.

The study adopted \nKlein and Nicholls (1998) to identify and classify adaptation  \noptions: managed retreat, accommodation, and protection  \n(Table 2).\n7\nStrategy Options\nManaged retreat No development in susceptible areas \nConditional phased-out development \nRelocation projects\nAccommodation Modification of land use \nModification of building styles and codes \nStrict regulation of hazard zones \nHazard insurance\nProtection Hard structural options:\n          Dikes, levees and floodwalls\n          Seawalls, revetments and bulkheads \n          Detached breakwaters \n          Floodgates and tidal barriers \n          Saltwater intrusion barriers\nSoft structural options:  \n          Periodic beach nourishment\n          Dune/wetland restoration  \n          and creation\nQuantitative assessment of household vulnerability used the \nconcept of Vulnerability as an Expected Poverty (VEP) an \neconometric approach to measure vulnerability of households \ndefined as the probability that households or individuals will \nmove to poverty in the future or fall below a minimum \nconsumption threshold level, given certain shocks (Chaudhuri \n2003). These shocks may include the occurrence of climate \nextremes or climate variability. The analytical procedure followed \nthe work of Chaudhuri et al. (2002) and Deressa et al. (2008).\nThe study used World Bank\u2019s minimum consumption threshold \nlevel of US$1.25 per capita per day. The analysis was based on the \nassumption that climate extremes or climate shocks, particularly \ntyphoon, flood and drought, will have an influence on the \nprobability that households\u2019 consumption will fall below a given \nminimum level (Deressa et al. 2009).\nThe Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA) on the other hand was used \nto assess the economic viability of different planned adaptation \noptions, i.e. adaptation options that can be implemented by \ncommunities or local governments. The decision criterion of CEA \nwas to choose the option that can achieve a specific objective at \nthe least cost. In cases where the objective of adaptation is multiple, \nCEA was applied when one objective can be expressed in the \nother by assigning importance (weight) to the objectives.\nTo analyze the choice of autonomous adaptation strategies\n employed by households the study used the discrete choice \nmodel. While it is common in the literature to use a probit model, \nhouseholds respond to a confluence of events, and coastal \ncommunities often face simultaneous hazards. Thus, there is \nprudence in looking at decisions as if they were interrelated, \nwhich entails examining collectively the decisions to adapt \nagainst several hazards.\nTable 2. General adaptation strategies\n3.0 Study Results\n3.1 Climate change hazards, impacts and other issues in the \nstudy areas\nThe most common and dominant threats in all the study sites \nare sea level rise (SLR) and extreme events such as typhoons, and \nto some degree storm surges. The attendant bio-geophysical \nimpacts from the confluence of these hazards are coastal erosion, \nflooding/inundation and saltwater intrusion. Table 3 presents the \nsummary of climate change issues and related concerns raised in \nthe project sites.\nThere were also various factors that exacerbate damages from \nthese bio-geophysical impacts. For example in San Juan, Batangas, \nsand quarrying has hastened coastal erosion from rising sea levels \nand storm surges. Illegal fishing confounds the impact of SLR on \ndeclining fish stock and recruitment potential. Charcoal making \nalso has led to a decrease in the mangrove area in the study site. \nThe same contributory factors were observed in Palawan but an \nadditional factor noted is extensive foreshore development that \nhastened coastal erosion. In Jakarta Bay, Indonesia, land subsidence \ncaused partly by groundwater extraction has exacerbated the \neffects of the rising sea.\n3.2 Initiatives on climate change adaptation and disaster \nmitigation\nThere is a variety of autonomous adaptation documented in the \nstudy sites. The behavior of households in choosing responses to \nclimate change is quite diverse. For instance, in Vietnam rainwater \nharvesting was reported as a response to saltwater intrusion  \nbut not at both sites in the Philippines which also experienced \nsaltwater intrusion. Annexes 1\u20134 enumerate current and potential \ninitiatives on climate change adaptation and disaster mitigation \nin the study areas. Some of the initiatives respond to the attendant \nconfounding factors but may not contribute directly to increasing \nthe adaptive capacity of households. Nevertheless, they are \nimportant in so far as creating an environment that enhances the \neffects of planned as well as autonomous adaptations.\n3.3 Vulnerability assessment and impacts of climate hazards\nParticipatory mapping activities were conducted to illustrate \ndetailed village layout and infrastructure as perceived by the \nresidents themselves. These are vital to capture a better \nunderstanding of the livelihood strategies and assets of the \ncommunities, their dependence on different resources, perceived \nclimate changes, their capacity to cope with these changes and \nassess their needs. They also provide information on the role of \ndifferent institutions in supporting them to cope with and adapt \nto perceived changes. In addition, hazard and physical vulnerability \nmapping activities helped to identify the areas and resources \nperceived to be at risk from climate hazards. Table 4 presents the \nprimary hazards identified in each study site based on the \nvulnerability matrix and comparative ranking of hazards.\nBatangas Indonesia Palawan Vietnam\nHazards\n- Sea level rise \n- Coastal erosion\nConfounding environmental \nissues:\n- Sand quarrying \n- Illegal charcoal making using  \n  mangroves & other species\n- Illegal fishing using blasting   \n  and cyanide (non-resident)\n- Use of fine mesh net and \n  superlight in fishing\nImpacts\n- Damage to property \n  (hotels, resort, houses and\n  boat) during typhoon or \n  low pressure area\n- Coral bleaching and increasing \n  number of crown-of-thorns \n  starfish \n- Impacts to livelihood \n  and tourism in vulnerable \n  coastal areas\n- A number of houses relocated \n  because of coastal erosion\n- Houses, boats, and trees \n   washed out during typhoons\n- Decrease in fish catch during \n  typhoons\n- Mangrove areas, coral reefs, \n  marine protected area and \n  beaches also found at risk \n  due to climate change\nHazards\n- Coastal erosion and seawater \n  intrusion\n- Coastal or tidal flooding\n- Sea level rise\nConfounding environmental \nissues\n- Loss of most of mangrove \n  and coastal ecosystems\n- Loss of biological diversity \n  and habitat degradation\n- Large population size that \n  creates economic difficulties   \n  and social problems\n- Pollution that affects water \n  quality, frequency of flooding, \n  soil erosion, and quality of river \n  systems\n- Absence of a synchronized   \n  single fisheries policy in the \n  area due to overlapping \n  jurisdictions\nImpacts\n- Land subsidence, coastal \n  inundation and coastal \n  abrasion\n- Sea water intrusion has \n  reached the National \n  Monument\n- Increased turbidity of water \n  affecting photosynthesis\n- Decreasing water quality\n- Disturbance to the flow\n  of shipping to the port access \n- Change in the pattern of flow, \n  bathymetry and coast line \n- Sediment accumulation in \n  the entrance of harbor lanes,  \n  which increase costs (related \n  to dredging)\nHazards\n- More frequent and intense\n   typhoons\n- Floods \nConfounding environmental \nissues\n- Mangroves cut for charcoal, \n  housing and fencing materials \n- Weak enforcement of coastal \n  laws \n- Illegal fishing \n- Burning of some upland areas \n  to give way for rice farming \n  (kaingin) \n- Growing private beach front\n  property development for \n  housing and resorts \n- Lack of protection for the fish \n  sanctuary because the guard \n  house was destroyed by a \n  typhoon\nImpacts\n- Water advances towards their \n  homes\n- Change in the fish species   \n  caught \n- More houses and more \n  bancas were destroyed as  \n  a result of typhoons\n- Coral bleaching outside of the \n  sanctuary decreased area of \n  land due to coastal erosion\n- Increased temperature killed a \n  substantial number of the  \n  traditionally gleaned shells  \n  along the coastline\n- Sea water is hotter during the \n  3\u20134 pm gleaning activity\n- Landslide; siltation extends up \n  to 2 kilometers on both sides \n  of a nearby river\n- Bangus fry collected for \n  the past 5\u20136 years declined \n  significantly\nHazards\n- More frequent and intense   \n  typhoons\n- Destructive flood and tidal   \n  surges from 1996 to 2008\n- Salty droughts in 2008\nConfounding environmental \nissues \n- Sand mining \n- Heavy traffic of sea vessels\nImpacts\n- Loss of shelter and livelihood \n  from typhoons\n- Land encroachment\n- Salt water intrusion  \n  during the dry season leads to \n  a  shortage of fresh water for \n  domestic household and \n  production uses\nTable 3.

Loss in \nincome due to work disruption is almost twice the value of \ndamages in assets including damage to houses. This is not \nsurprising because these households are often very poor, thus \nthe value of their assets is also comparatively very low.\nDisruption in income streams and sources eventually rebound \nto a decline in consumption. Using the VEP framework and the \nWorld Bank minimum consumption threshold of $1.25 per capita \nper day, the study estimated the vulnerability of the households \nto climate change impacts. Mean vulnerability estimate for all \nhouseholds was highest for Palawan at 0.51, followed by Vietnam \nat 0.43, Batangas at 0.38 and Indonesia at 0.37. Mean VEP for \nthose who are already considered highly vulnerable is highest \nfor Indonesia at 0.92, followed by Vietnam at 0.91. Mean VEP \nestimates for the highly vulnerable group in Batangas and \nPalawan are 0.88 and 0.87, respectively (Annex 5).\nIn terms of incidence or percentage of households considered \nvulnerable, the highest was also found in Palawan (56%), followed \n8\nFigure 3. Distribution of households according to level of vulnerability.\nTable 5. Primary occupation of heads of vulnerable households (percentage distribution).\nby Vietnam (46%), Batangas (42%) and then Indonesia (35%). \nHowever, the incidence of those who are considered highly \nvulnerable is highest for Vietnam (31%), with Palawan and \nIndonesia running second at 22%. Batangas had the lowest \nincidence of highly vulnerable households at 15%. Figure 3 \nshows the distribution of household according to level of \nvulnerability across the study sites.\nOne of the primary purposes of vulnerability assessment is to \ngenerate information that can aid in decision making. Hence, \nprofiles of vulnerable households were established, and we \nneed to describe their characteristics and analyze their profile. \nSuch information can serve as a guide for governments, private \norganizations and the community themselves in strategizing how \nbest to implement an adaptation program. Specifically, we looked \nat the primary occupation of the household heads, their perceptions \nabout their knowledge and preparedness to deal with future \nclimate change impacts, and the damages and impacts that they \nhave experienced from past climate-related hazards and events. \nLooking at the role of gender also provided interesting insights.\nIn all sites except for Indonesia the majority of vulnerable \nhouseholds are headed by persons who are primarily occupied \nin the agriculture, fishery and forestry sectors (Table 5). Hence, it \nmakes sense to implement interventions that target this particular \ngroup. It is important to note that this sector is highly sensitive \nto external shocks, including those brought about by climate \nchange. For instance, typhoon and flooding can destroy \nstanding crops and fish pens. It can also prohibit fishermen and \nforest gatherers (who rely on their daily catch/collections to \nprovide nourishment to their family) from going out to sea or \nto the forest.\nOne strategy could be livelihood diversification and income \naugmentation. Training and credit provision to support alternative \nlivelihoods may be pursued towards this end. The possibility of \nproviding insurance may also be explored. In Batangas and \nIndonesia, however, the heads of a significant proportion of \nvulnerable households are laborers, service-oriented trade and \nunskilled workers, or plant and machine operators. Hence, it is \nalso beneficial to implement interventions that target this sector.\nFarmers, fishers, hunter/gatherers, \nforesters\nService-oriented workers, trade and \nrelated workers, plant and machine \noperators, laborers and unskilled workers\nOfficials, managers and business  \nowners, professionals, technicians, \nclerks, and special occupations\nBatangas 55 25 10\nPalawan 73 13 4\nVietnam 81 13 0\nIndonesia 6 49 0\n9\nBATANGAS\nINDONESIA\nVIETNAM\nPALAWAN\nHighly\nvulnerable\n15%\nHighly\nvulnerable\n31%\nHighly\nvulnerable\n22%\nHighly\nvulnerable\n22%\nModerately\nvulnerable\n27% Moderately\nvulnerable\n15%\nModerately\nvulnerable\n13% Moderately\nvulnerable\n34%\nNot\nvulnerable\n58%\nNot\nvulnerable\n54%\nNot\nvulnerable\n65%\nNot\nvulnerable\n44%\n10\nKnowledge and information are crucial elements in ensuring that \nhouseholds are able to withstand or minimize the impacts of \nclimate change. In Indonesia, Batangas and Vietnam the majority \nof the vulnerable households revealed that they have little or no \nknowledge about climate change and its impacts (Table 6). For \nTable 7. Distribution of vulnerable households based on their preparedness to deal with future impacts of climate change (in percentage).\nTable 6. Level of knowledge of vulnerable households about climate change (percentage distribution).\nTable 8. Typhoon and flooding impacts among vulnerable households (incidence in %).\nthese sites, it may be necessary for climate change adaptation \nprograms to include information-dissemination activities. For \nPalawan, on the other hand, the trend is quite different, with a \nsignificant proportion (38%) revealing that at the very least their \nknowledge about climate change is adequate.\nNo information A little bit of knowledge Adequate knowledge Fully knowledgeable\nBatangas 47 40 11 2\nPalawan 14 48 36 2\nVietnam 40 58 2 0\nIndonesia 73 23 3 0\nIn Table 7 it is shown that a large proportion of the vulnerable \nhouseholds (63%) in Vietnam and Indonesia consider themselves \nunprepared for future climate change hazards. This proportion is \nsmaller for Batangas and Palawan with 22 and 12%, respectively. \nThe proportion of households claiming that they are at least \nLooking at the impact of past hazards on vulnerable households \ncan also serve as a guide to the strategic formulation and targeting \nof adaptation programs. It is a means by which we can roughly \nassess the adaptation needs of the communities living in the \nstudy site. The incidence of these impacts among vulnerable \nhouseholds is summarized in Tables 8, 9 and 10. Major impact for \nvulnerable households in Batangas is income loss due to work \nstoppage, loss of fishing income, damage to houses, and \ngastrointestinal illnesses. Again this highlights the need to augment \nincome sources of vulnerable households. This also means that \nhealthcare provision may be necessary to address their needs.\nFor Palawan, impacts seem to be quite minimal, affecting only a \nsmall percentage of the vulnerable households. Among these, \ngastrointestinal illness among household members had the \nhighest incidence. Impacts in Vietnam are much more widespread, \nwith more than half of the vulnerable households experiencing \ndamage to their houses from typhoon and flooding, while 47% \nreported experiencing shortage in fresh water supply for their \ndomestic household use.\nadequately prepared is highest for Palawan (48%), followed by \nBatangas (34%) and Indonesia (5%). In Vietnam, it is alarming that \nnot one household claimed it was at least adequately prepared to \naddress future climate change impacts. This highlights the need \nfor government assistance in adaptation.\nNot prepared Somewhat prepared Adequately prepared Fully prepared\nBatangas 22 43 23 11\nPalawan 12 39 35 13\nVietnam 63 37 0 0\nIndonesia 63 31 4 1\nLoss of income from agriculture production and aquaculture \nproduction also seems to be a major problem, affecting as \nhigh as 25% of vulnerable households. Strengthening house \nstructures is a possible adaptation strategy for Vietnam, as well \nas the implementation of flood mitigating projects. Livelihood \nprograms may also prove to be a strategic intervention. Also, \nsince a significant proportion of vulnerable households are \nsusceptible to saltwater intrusion impacts, particularly affecting \nagricultural production, introduction of relevant technologies, \nsuch as the planting of salt tolerant crops, may be pursued.\nIn Indonesia, no household reported sustaining impacts from \ntyphoon and floods, and saltwater intrusion. The most significant \nimpacts that households reported are damage to house (affecting \n9% of households) as well as household appliances (6%). Since \nthe primary cause of these damages are erosion and sea level \nrise it might be reasonable to consider relocation of affected \nhouseholds away from the shoreline.\nTyphoon and Flooding Impacts Batangas Palawan Vietnam Indonesia\nDamage to house 11 1 54 0\nDamage/loss of appliances 5 1 14 0\nLoss of livestock 1 0 0 0\nDamage to assets (boats, motorcycles) 1 0 6 0\nLoss in agricultural production 0 1 15 0\nLoss in fishing income 11 1 5 0\nLoss in aquaculture production 0 1 15 0\nIncome loss due to work stoppage 13 2 2 0\nThe role of gender still remains controversial. Some argue that \nwomen are more vulnerable since majority of the world\u2019s \npoor are women, and most women are largely dependent on \nlivelihoods that rely heavily on the use of natural resources. The \nlatter reason makes women more susceptible because natural \nresource intensive livelihoods are very sensitive to shocks. On the \nother hand, some contend that women play an important role in \nadaptation, which essentially reduces the household\u2019s vulnerability. \nNonetheless, it is important that adaptation programs should be \ngender sensitive. Table 11 shows the distribution of vulnerable \nhouseholds based on gender of household head. For all sites, \nalthough majority of the vulnerable households are male-headed, \na significant proportion (between 13 and 38%) are female-headed. \nIn terms of incidence of vulnerability, it can be seen that it is \nhigher for males in Vietnam, Batangas and Indonesia \u2013 48, 43 and \n42%, respectively. For Palawan, however, incidence is significantly \nhigher for female-headed households at 74%, while male-headed \nhouseholds have a 55% vulnerability incidence (Table 12).\n3.4 Cost-effectiveness analysis of planned adaptation options\nThe planned adaptation strategies were selected through \nconsultation with the residents, key individuals and officials of \nthe community. After identifying the list of planned adaptation \nstrategies in the study areas, the options were evaluated using \ncost-effectiveness analysis (CEA). Tables 18 to 21 present the CEAs \nconducted for each of the sites.\n3.4.1 Vietnam\nTwo options were considered for cost effectiveness analysis, the \nconstruction of freshwater supply plant and the construction \nof a sea dyke system. The first option will ensure the supply of \nsufficient fresh water for agriculture, industry, tourism, services, \nand household domestic use within Thanh Phu, Cho Lach, Mo Cay \nNam, and Mo Cay Bac. The sea dike system on the other hand, will \nprevent flooding caused by tides, typhoons, and sea level rise in \nfavor of 10 communes in Thanh Phu district.\n11\nTable 9.

This will require an \ninitial investment of VND 2,999,704,000,000 (USD 144,661,651.23) \n(Table 4). The operating costs include maintenance and \nmiscellaneous costs, which will start by 2013.

Population growth rate is \nassumed to be 1.16% per year. With this information, the total \nnumber of households until 2049 can be easily calculated. For \nthe water plant, in the first four years of construction, the project \nwill not generate any benefit. From 2015 to 2019 the number \nof benefited households is equal to 85% of the total number of \nhouseholds. From 2020 to 2049 the figure mounts to 90%. Such \nassumptions reflect the fact that a proportion of households will \nnot take advantage of freshwater from the project because they \nare unable to cover the costs of investment for piped water \nconnection. Also in the communities there are few households \nwho are not affected by salt water intrusion and may be unwilling \nto participate.\nMonetary benefit can be calculated by multiplying the amount \nof water consumed within Thanh Phu district with unit price. Unit \nprice of freshwater is assumed to be constant, that is, VND 3,500/\nm3. Here we assume that 95% of freshwater produced will be \nconsumed. The rest (5%) is wasted along pipelines. From 2015 to \n2019 monetary benefit would be VND5,780,512,500 (USD287,767) \n(DARD Ben Tre 2011). From 2020 to 2049 the amount would be \nVND8,448,825,000 (USD407,447).\nFor the sea dike the benefits were estimated based on the following \nassumptions. As of 2011, the total population in the project site \nis 66,504. It was assumed that the population will grow at a rate \nof 1.16% per year. The number of households benefiting from \nthe sea dike first occurs in 2012 and keeps increasing until 2049 \n(DARD Ben Tre 2010). Monetary benefit can be measured by \nestimating the monetary value resulting from increased \nproductivity in agriculture. This value can be obtained from \nsecondary data.\n3.4.2 Batangas\nFive adaptation options were subjected to CEA \u2013 the construction \nof a sea wall, mangrove reforestation, establishment of an early \nwarning system, land zoning, and implementation of a livelihood \nprogram. The proposed sea wall will be 3 meters in height and \n1 meter thick. It will have an underwater base that is 1.5 meters \nhigh and 3 meters thick. The proposed construction materials are \na combination of concrete and boulders, stacked to form a wall. \nThe mangrove reforestation would consist of propagules from \nthe species already prevailing in the site to ensure that the rate of \nsurvival would be relatively high.\nThrough an effective early warning system the number of  \navoidable and unnecessary deaths and property damage \ncould be reduced dramatically. In this study, this option also  \nincludes an effective response system involving evacuation and  \nprovision of temporary shelter. Because of budget constraints, the \ntemporary shelters would be in schools and in public gymnasiums.\nLand zoning through the Comprehensive Land Use Program \n(CLUP) is an important option to minimize the damage posed  \nby typhoon and flooding. Through the CLUP development in  \nlands that are flood-prone will be prohibited. Also, subdivision  \ndevelopers will be required to undertake flood-proofing  \nmeasures as part of the strategy, while informal settlers living  \nnear the river banks will be relocated.\n12\nExperiences in other countries have shown that the ability to \ncope with increasing climatic hazards is highly dependent on \nthe ability to diversify income sources (Truong 2007). For the \nlivelihood program, barangay residents would be provided an \nopportunity to be trained in an off-shore, non-fishing source of \nlivelihood. After the initial round of training they will be assisted \nin terms of management and financial aspects of the business that \nthey will set-up. Access to credit would also be part of the package.\nBased from the best estimates of key informants, composed of an \nofficer from the Provincial Government Environment and Natural \nResources Office (PGENRO), a civil engineer, an NGO official  \nengaged in mangrove reforestation and officers from the Municipal  \nAgriculture Office and Provincial Disaster Coordinating Council, \nthe following assumptions about the cost and impacts of the  \noptions were made:\n\u2022\t Seawall construction: about PhP7.5M (USD174,054)  \nfor 1000 linear meters; \n\u2022\t Maintenance cost is PhP50,000 (USD1,160) annually. \n\u2022\t Mangrove reforestation, initial cost is PhP300,000 \n(USD6,962) with an annual maintenance and  \nmonitoring cost of PhP60,000 (USD1,392). \n\u2022\t Developing an integrated drainage and flood control  \nsystem is PhP4M (USD92,829) spread over 2 years until  \nits full completion. \n\u2022\t Maintenance cost of the drainage system is  \nat PhP100,000 (USD2,321) annually.\n\u2022\t CLUP formulation and revision is PhP 3M (USD69,622) \nwhile PhP 100,000 (USD2,321) is provided for the annual \nmonitoring and evaluation of the zoning ordinance.\nTable 15.

There is no benefit for the  \nseawall in the first year while the structure is being constructed. \nThe benefit of having the protection from coastal erosion starts  \nat the 5th year when mangrove propagules become fully matured \ntrees and it is assumed to increase through time. As theses \nmangrove propagules become full-grown and mature trees as \ntime passes by their ability to stabilize the shore is predicted to \nincrease. Predictions are based on a 60% rate of survival for the \npropagules.\n3.4.3 Indonesia\nSeveral adaptation options were considered in the study as  \nsummarized in Table 15.\nFor Rorotan, the first option is the construction of the East Flood \nCanal. This project is expected to be able to resolve the flooding \nin Jakarta City, particularly the massive flooding occurring every \nfive years. This huge canal spanning 23.5 km will be able to serve \n13 Villages including Rorotan Village. Land acquisition comprises \nmore than half of the total investment cost of USD269,058,300 \nwhile the construction of the canal costs USD236,199,160. \nConstruction is expected to last 10 years accruing a total \ninvestment cost of USD505,257,460. The maintenance cost for \nthe following years after the construction is USD 472,400 per year. \nSince this is a huge project the number of households that can be \nserved is around 148,184 and covers 13 villages. It is assumed to \nlast for at least 40 years.\nThe second proposition is the dredging of Sunter River \ncrossing Rorotan Village covering a length of 3 km. The \ninvestment cost for every kilometer is USD751,120 in the first \nyear, and the maintenance for drainage cleaning for the next \n10 years costs USD168,160 per year.\nFor Marunda, the first option is a 3-meter high permanent \nembankment along its 8 km coastline. The investment cost for \nthis proposed strategy is USD2,802,690 in 2 years and the \nmaintenance cost is USD22,240 per year. The second potential \nstrategy is to plant mangroves regularly. The investment for \nproviding 1000 mangrove seeds costs USD390. It is assumed that \nit would only serve a total population of this area which is 3,792 \nhouseholds.\nFor Kalibaru, the total investment cost to elevate roads for 330 \nmeters is USD22,200 and the maintenance cost for road \npavements is USD1,110. For the provision of fresh water, \nthe investment cost is USD2,833,320 while maintenance is \nUSD708,330 per year. This small intervention might only serve \nthe 10,119 households of this village. The investment cost for \nthe second option, dredging Cakung River along its 2 km length, \nis USD1,502,240, while maintenance it is USD336,320 per year. \nDredging Cakung River will not only affect the habitants of \nKalibaru Village but also the 13,911 households living in Marunda \nvillage.\nIn Kamal Muara, the initial investment cost to dredge the \n3 km length of the Pesanggrahan River is USD2,253,360, while \nmaintenance would be USD504,480 per year. Dredging this river \n13\n14\nwill serve residents of Kamal Muara village and surrounding \nvillages including Kapuk Muara and Pluit. This means that a total \nof 20,891 households will benefit from this option. The second \npotential strategy is to plant 20 ha of mangroves which would \ncost USD23,540 for the mangrove seeds and about USD20 per \nperson per day for labor.\nFor Muara Angke Sub-District there are two potential \nstrategies \u2013 elevating roads and planting mangroves. The \ninvestment cost to elevate a 5 km road is USD336,320 with \nIn Babuyan, the construction of a breakwater is expected to \nbenefit 200 households living in the coastal areas as well as a \nstretch of 6.3 km of coastline. It is assumed that one kilometer of \nshoreline will benefit 32 households (7.83 km shoreline with 251 \nHH residents). The dike on the other hand will be constructed on \nthe mouth of the river and will benefit only 126 households. \nMangrove reforestation is expected to provide progressive \nbenefits. It was assumed that only around 10% of the expected \nhousehold beneficiaries will benefit on the fifth year and the \nnumber will increase by 25 households every year for the next \nfour years.\nIn riverbank rehabilitation, the overflow of the river and siltation \nare expected to be addressed. Using the Vetiver grass alone, eight \nha of fishponds and coconut plantations will be protected from \nriver overflow on the first year. On the second year, 24 ha will \nbe protected and an increase of 20% is expected every year \nthereafter. The target reduction in erosion and siltation is at least \n80% and the full benefit is expected to start on the 7th year. \nThe impact of riverbank rehabilitation using the Vetiver grass \ncombined with mechanical method is assumed to be greater \nbecause of the additional materials used to reinforce the capacity \nof the grass in holding the soil.\nIn the case of coral reefs, benefit will start on the 4th year. Dike \nconstruction along the mouth of the river will benefit a total \nof 107 ha of coconut plantations, fishponds and coral reefs \ncombined. Riverbed clearing as an option to be done annually \nwill likewise benefit a total of 91.5 ha of coconut plantations, \nfishponds and coral reefs. The operation will require almost 3 \nmonths to complete.\nFinally, 126 household are believed to benefit from upland \nreforestation. Expected benefit will commence from the 6th year \nand will multiply at the rate of 25 households per year. Likewise, \nhalf of the total households are predicted to avoid any disaster \nmaintenance cost of USD16,820 per year. This intervention \nserves not only the local habitants of this village but also the \nwhole subdistrict, with the total number of households served \nreaching 49,792. The second potential strategy is to plant \n17 ha of mangroves, which costs USD 20,010 for the mangrove \nseeds and about USD20 per person per day for labor.\n3.4.4 Palawan\nIn Palawan, the adaptation options included in the analysis are \nsummarized in Table 16.\nTable 16.

This option will go hand in hand with the establishment \nof temporary evacuation centers. A further option is to relocate \nthe community. This relocation would take place in two batches. \nThe first batch would comprise 125 households then after a year \nthe last 126 households would follow.\nFor Babuyan, both the breakwater and seawall are expected \nto provide a constant protection to the households and the \ncoastline. The breakwater is expected to provide 80% protection \nto the households living on the coastal area, because the \nbreakwater will not cover the full length of the coastline. Aside \nfrom protecting the households, the degree of erosion is also \nexpected to be minimized and about 90% (8.58 km) of the total \ncoastal areas will be protected.\nThe cost assumptions for the planned adaptation options are \npresented in Table 17. There was no identified maintenance cost \nfor the structures. It was given that \u2013 assuming the construction \nprocess followed strictly the standard for seawall, dike and \nbreakwater \u2013 no cost will be incurred within the specified \neffective life of the structures under normal conditions. Mangroves \nplanted during reforestation were computed to have 80% survival \nrate, therefore 20% of the seedlings planted would need replenishing \nthe following year.\nVarious planned adaptation options, which communities and \nlocal governments can implement, were analyzed using cost \neffectiveness analysis (CEA). A consistent and common result \nacross three sites is that ecosystem-based approaches are more \ncost-effective than hard infrastructure investments. This is true \nfor the case of mangrove reforestation (whenever applicable) \nwhen compared with sea walls, embankments, and breakwaters. \nIn Batangas, where livelihood diversification was considered \nfor CEA, it was found that this intervention which can augment \n15\nTable 17.  Cost assumptions for planned adaptation options.\nthe income-earning capacities of households is a cost-effective \nplanned adaptation option.\nAs explained, the options considered for cost-effectiveness \nanalysis were identified by the stakeholders, which include the \nlocal government. There seem to be a preponderance of \nprotective measures (as seen in the table) when, in fact, the main \nimpact or risks from these hazards is really on the livelihoods \nof coastal-based communities. There is somewhat a disjoint in \npolicy here. It is not to say that these initiatives are not needed. \nThe results merely point to the fact that for coastal communities \nany public initiative should incorporate a livelihood diversification \ncomponent.\nAdaptation Options/Cost Items Volume Cost per unit (USD) Total cost USD (\u2018000) Year cost incurred\nBreakwater construction 298.68\nConstruction cost   100 298.68 298.68 Y0\nDike construction 34.81\nConstruction cost 1,000 34.81 34.81 Y0\nMangrove reforestation 5,819.67\n   Planting material\n   Planting material\n   Labor \n50,000\n300\n50,000\n0.30\n0.12\n15.08\n0.09\n5804.5\nY0\nY1\nRelocation of affected HH 314.46\n   Acquisition of land/devt\n   House construction\n   House construction\n1\n125\n126\n23,210\n1,160.36\n1,160.36\n23.21\n145.05\n146.21\nY0\nY0\nY1\nRiverbank rehab using Vetiver grass 9.28\n   Planting materials\n   Labor\n   Transport\n   Replanting\n18,000\n90\n1\n0.01\n0.20\n2.00\n4.18\n0.42\n0.05\n4.64\nY0\nRiverbank rehab using Vetiver grass combined \nwith mechanical method. 41.35\n   Planting material\n   Labor\n   Materials needed\n   Labor for landscaping\n   Replanting of Vetiver grass\n18,000\n90\n1\n1\n0.00023\n0.005\n23.21\n8.91\n4.18\n0.42\n23.21\n8.91\n4.64\nY0\nY0\nY0\nY0\nDike/levee construction 66.14\n   Construction cost   \n   Rehabilitation cost (90% of the construction cost) 1000\n34.81\n31.33 34.81 Y0\nClearing of riverbed 19.54\n   Backhoe/dredger rent\n   Fuel\n   Oil/lubricants\n   Wages\n320\n4,800\n1\n40\n34.81\n1.39\n1.16\n13.92\n11.14\n6.68\n1.16\n0.56\nY0\nY0\nY0\nY0\nUpland reforestation 749.09\n    Seedlings (free)\n    Trans. cost\n   Replanting\n   Replanting\n   Replanting\n   Labor cost\n5000\n1000\n200\n40\n6240\n0.05\n0.05\n0.05\n0.05\n0.12\n0.23\n0.05\n0.01\n0.002\n748.8\nY0\nY1\nY2\nY3\nIEC/Establish disaster warning system and \nprovision of temporary evacuation center 0.23\nSupplies and materials\nPrep of temporary evacuation centers 1 0.23\n0.23\n1160.9 Y0\n16\nTable 18.

Likelihood ratio tests \nrejected the hypothesis that the correlation of error terms across \nthe three probit equations is equal to zero. This confirms the \nvalidity of using a multivariate probit, which leads to more \nefficient estimates.\n3.5.1 Adaptation to flooding and typhoons\nFrom the table above one can see that the following factors \nsignificantly increase the likelihood of adapting to flooding: \nhousehold size, percentage of fishing income to total income, the \nvalue of damages from worst flooding incidence, and the number \nof people whom the household can surely borrow from.\nBigger households tend to adapt more to flooding probably \nbecause they can meet the labor demands of frequent or \nrecurring adaptation. Note that floods and typhoons, unlike \ncoastal erosion and saltwater intrusion, are extreme events that \noccur regularly within a year. Often these events occur as many \nas 20 times in a year. The negative sign on the number of female \nhousehold members supports this contention. Since men are \noften more involved in preparation for typhoons and flooding, \nhouseholds with more females are less likely to be able to pursue \nadaptation strategies against flooding and typhoon.\nIn terms of site location, the Vietnamese respondents are more \nlikely to adapt to flooding and typhoons compared with respondents \nin coastal communities in Batangas (the base location variable). \nOn the other hand, people residing in the coastal communities in \nPalawan are less likely to adapt to flooding, since compared with \nBatangas this province is not in the common path of typhoons in \nthe Philippines. A related variable is the value of damages from \nthe worst flooding. Households who experienced and have vivid \nmemories of large damages from the worst case of flooding will \nalso be more likely to adapt.\nPresence of mangroves in front of the house, on the other hand, \ndecreases the likelihood of employing autonomous adaptation \nstrategies. This seems to point to a \u201ccrowding out\u201d effect of natural \nbarriers systems. Mahmud and Barbier (2011) found the same \nresult in their study of autonomous adaptation to a cyclone in \nBangladesh.\n18\nTable 22. Results of multivariate probit on adaptation to multiple hazards.\nAlso evident in the table is the negative sign of the coefficient \nof the variable representing distance from creeks and rivers. It \nis often the case that excessive rains cause rivers and creeks to \noverflow, leading to flooding. Houses that are near these bodies \nof water are therefore more prone to the effects of flooding; the \nneed to adapt is consequently more urgent. \nThis means that households rationally react to the degree of \nthreat that they perceive. Another result that supports this is the \nfact that pure fishermen or households that depend more on \nfishing are also more likely to use various adaptation strategies \nagainst flooding. Fishermen often live close to the shore, since it \nis easier to access the sea with their boats. One can conclude from \nthe above that households respond rationally to the degree of \nthreats. Households located in areas where risks are higher also \nhave stronger compulsion to protect or insure themselves against \nloss or damages.\nFlooding Coastal soil erosion/SLR Saltwater intrusion\nAge of HH head 0.002 0.001 0.015***\n-0.003 -0.004 -0.004\nYears of schooling 0.002 0.000 0.067***\n-0.002 -0.003 -0.018\nHH size 0.066** 0.061* -0.061\n-0.031 -0.034 -0.041\nDependency ratio 0.000 0.000 0.000\n-0.001 -0.001 -0.001\nNumber of female -0.102** -0.055 0.189***\n-0.044 -0.051 -0.066\nPalawan -1.202*** -0.433*** -0.190\n-0.142 -0.161 -0.133\nVietnam 0.457*** 0.755*** 0.745***\n-0.146 -0.126 -0.183\nIndonesia 16.827 -3.393 34.604***\n-12.843 -14.645 -12.863\nPresence of mangrove -0.004** 0.000 0.005\n-0.002 -0.003 -0.004\nDistance from creek/rivers -0.000*** -0.000** 0.000\n0.000 0.000 0.000\nType of roofing materials 0.052 -0.075* 0.058\n-0.034 -0.040 -0.041\nOwns pigs 0.168 -0.036 0.233*\n-0.129 -0.148 -0.128\nIncome from gifts, relief, support, etc. 0.000 -0.000* 0.000\n0.000 0.000 0.000\n% of fishing income in total income 0.008** -0.010* -0.047**\n-0.003 -0.006 -0.021\nValue of Damages 0.000* 0.000 0.000\n0.000 0.000 0.000\n# of people whom you can surely borrow 0.006*** 0.005** -0.004\n-0.002 -0.002 -0.008\nPerception on climate change -0.015 -0.020 -0.032\n-0.047 -0.052 -0.058\nPresence of riverbank rehabilitation 0.003 0.003 -0.331***\n-0.002 -0.003 -0.115\nConstant -0.540** -1.144*** -0.489\n-0.214 -0.252 -0.348\nObservations 1203\nRobust standard errors in parentheses; * significant at 10%; ** significant at 5%; *** significant at 1%\n19\nbodies of water, lead to differences in autonomous  \nbehavior. Again this underscores the need for hazard \nmapping and communicating risks emanating from these \nhazard maps to coastal communities.\nb.  The nature of the hazard matters and is somehow related \nto a gender dimension in adaptation. For something like \nthe flooding and typhoons, which are recurring and often \npassing extreme events, household male labor is an  \nessential component for implementing recurrent or  \nrepetitive adaptation strategies. On the other hand,  \npermanent but creeping or slowly occurring hazards  \nlike saltwater intrusion, female labor is essential since  \nadaptation takes the form of a common household chore.\nc.  Government projects may crowd out autonomous  \nstrategies. Similar to other studies, we find natural  \nprotection such as mangroves and planned adaptation \nsuch riverbank rehabilitation as substitutes for self-protection  \nand self-insurance. Likewise, income from disaster  \nand relief operations can also lead to a reduction in the  \nprobability of adaptation to extreme events such as coastal \nerosion.\nd.  Increasing trust in a community also leads to increased \n autonomous adaptation. This social variable can be a  \ncontributing factor to adaptation against coastal erosion \nand flooding. Extreme events that either recurring or \npermanent.\ne. Finally, in terms of methodology, there is gain in modeling   \nadaptation options as joint decisions in the case of coastal \n communities.\nThe social capital variable \u201cnumber of people whom you can \nborrow from\u201d also increases the likelihood of employing adaptive \nmeasures against flooding and typhoon. This factor measures the \nlevel of trust on the respondent. In some ways, trust increases the \nhousehold\u2019s capacity to autonomously adapt to these extreme \nevents.\n3.5.2 Adaptation to coastal soil erosion/sea level rise\nAs with the earlier results for adaptation to flooding, there are also \nsite differences in the likelihood of adapting to coastal erosion \nand sea level rise. In particular, Palawan coastal communities are \nless likely to adapt to this threat relative to Batangas. On the other \nhand, respondents from Vietnam are more likely to adapt relative \nto Batangas coastal communities. Again, this likely captures the \ndifference in the severity of the threat in these countries. \nSimilarly, spatial factors also affect the decision to privately \nadapt to this bio-geophysical impact. We find that households or \nrespondents farther away from riverbanks and streams are less \nlikely to adapt. Likewise, household size and the social capital \nvariable both increase the likelihood of autonomous adaptation \nin response to coastal erosion.\nRegression results also show that respondents with roofing \nmaterials made of very light materials are also less likely to \nautonomously adapt. Perhaps what this captures is the wealth \nlevel of these households. Wealthier households, i.e. those who \ncan afford more permanent roofing structures, are in a better \nposition to meet the financial requirements of adaptation.\nIt is also interesting to see that income from gifts, relief and \nsupport operations also reduces the likelihood of adaptation \nagainst coastal erosion. Coastal erosion often accompanies severe \ntyphoons, which often prompts disaster relief operations. \nThis means that disaster and relief \u201cdole outs\u201d, which are common \nlocal government initiatives during calamities, can \u201ccrowd out\u201d \nadaptive behavior.\n3.5.3 Adaptation to saltwater intrusion\nFinally, the last major hazard in the study areas is saltwater \nintrusion. Again, geographical differences are evident in the \nresults. In Vietnam, this is a major problem, as cited in the Focus \nGroup Discussions. Hence, as expected, households in these areas \nhave higher probability of employing adaptive strategies. \nOwnership of pigs is also a positive determinant of adaptation.\nFurthermore, saltwater intrusion is a permanent risk. This requires \nnot recurring or repetitive adaptive strategies, but rather \npermanent strategies like having piped water connection. This \nrequires financial capital \u2013 thus those with more liquid assets \nsuch as livestock are more likely to be in the position to adapt to \nsaltwater intrusion.\nUnlike the result for adaptation against flooding, the number of \nfemale household members increases the likelihood of adapting \nto saltwater intrusion. A common adaptation behavior against \nsaltwater intrusion is to get water from other sources. This is a \ncommon household chore women perform, thus explaining the \ndirect relationship between the number of female household \nmembers and probability of adaptation.\nWe again find a \u201ccrowding out\u201d effect of planned adaptation \nstrategies. This time we find that riverbank rehabilitation results \ninto lower probability of adaptation against saltwater intrusion.\n3.5.4 Insights from the multivariate probit results\nThe following insights can be gained from the results of the \nregression exercise: \na.  Geographical location matters. Obviously in areas or  \ncountries where a hazard is less of a threat, we can also \nexpect less adaptation. Coastal communities still rationally \ninsure and protect themselves against nature. Even within \nsites differences in say, distance from coastline and other \n20\n4.0 Summary and conclusions\nThis study sought among other things to gain a better \nunderstanding of the risks associated with climate change and \nassess the adaptation strategies and policy options to address \nthese risks more efficiently in coastal communities. This study \nteam has attempted to provide a cross-country comparison and \ntherefore a bigger picture on adaptation both at the public and \nprivate level. We intend to understand this within the unique \ncontext of multiple hazards that often confront households in \ncoastal communities. The study covered the countries of Vietnam, \nIndonesia and the Philippines. Its focus was on assessing the \nimpacts from three climate hazards besetting coastal communities, \nnamely typhoon/flooding, coastal erosion and saltwater intrusion. \nIt also analyzed planned adaptation options, which communities \nand local governments can implement, and also gauged the \nautonomous response of households to protect and insure \nthemselves from these hazards.\nIt utilized a variety of methodologies to gain a clearer picture of \nthe interrelated issues in four project sites in these three countries. \nMethodologies ranged from community-based approaches, such \nas community hazard mapping and focus group discussions \n(FGDs), to quantitative and econometric methods. These approaches \nprovided information for further activities in the project. \nSpecifically, the results of these community-based approaches \nwere fed into a household survey, which was analyzed using \nvarious regression techniques.\nThe results show that indeed households in the coastal communities \nface a confluence of risks and often adapt simultaneously to these \nrisks. These risks have most impacts on the livelihoods of households. \nForegone income due to these risks is often twice as high as the \nvalue of damages from loss of assets including the house. Both \nthe household survey and the FGDs lend evidence to this claim. \nWe find this not surprising because households in these \ncommunities are often poor and the value of their assets is often \nlow. These eventually have effects on their consumption.\nVEP or vulnerability measures show that the mean vulnerability \nestimate for all households was highest for Palawan at 0.51. This \nmeans that, on average, there is a 51% probability that households \nin Palawan will fall below the minimum consumption threshold of \nUSD1.25 per capita per day given shocks, including those that are \nclimate-related. This is followed by Vietnam at 0.43, Batangas at \n0.38, and Indonesia at 0.37. Accordingly, the incidence of \nvulnerability (or percentage of all households considered \nvulnerable) is highest in Palawan (56%), followed by Vietnam \n(46%), Batangas (42%) and then Indonesia (35%).\nVarious planned adaptation options, which communities and \nlocal governments can implement, were analyzed using cost \neffectiveness analysis (CEA). These options were identified \nthrough consultations with the community and local government \nofficials. There seem to be a preponderance of protective measures \nwhen, in fact, the main impact or risks from these hazards is really \non the livelihoods of coastal-based communities. A consistent \nand common result across three sites is that ecosystem-based \napproaches are more cost-effective than hard infrastructure \ninvestments. This is true for the case of mangrove reforestation \n(whenever this is applicable) when compared with sea walls, \nembankments, and breakwaters.\nThe study also found out that households, obviously, adapt or \nrespond autonomously to all three hazards. In fact, the econometric \nmodel of joint decision cannot be rejected by the data. We find \nthat perceptions about the future severity of climate change \ninfluence the decision to adapt. There are also geographical \ndifferences in adaptation patterns, reflecting that households \nreact rationally to the degree of threats from these hazards. \nUnlike instances recorded elsewhere we do not find evidence that \nplanned adaptation crowds out private or autonomous adaptation. \nHowever, we find that external sources of funds and social capital \nare substitutes for self-insurance and self-protection. This points \nto a potential moral hazard problem in autonomous adaptation, \nwhich demands further investigation.\n21\nReferences\nChaudhuri, S. 2003.

A betterunderstanding of migration patterns and the climate hazards that drive them can inform globalpolicy and preparedness for climate migration.1. IntroductionThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) defines climate change as \u2018a change in the state ofthe climate that can be identified by changes in the mean and/or the variability of its properties and thatpersists for an extended period, typically decades or longer\u2019 (IPCC 2023a, Glossary, 122). Although mostresearch on climate migration has focused on the most extreme examples in a small number of mostimpacted nations, climate change is affecting every country (IPCC 2023b, Observed Changes and Impacts).Climate hazards vary by region and while some communities have the capacity to cope with or adapt in placeto slowly occurring climatic changes or extremes depending on the severity of their impacts, otherindividuals or communities migrate to manage the risks posed by climate change and extremes (IPCC2023b). Some scholars view migration as an effective strategy to manage risk (Adger 2006, Black et al 2011,Gemenne and Blocher 2017), while others characterize it as a failure to adapt (Myers 2002, Felli and Castree2012). To inform efforts to manage and mitigate the negative effects of climate migration from thecommunity to the international level, it is critical to understand the factors that force or limit humanmigration when faced with climate hazards. Our central question is: what climate hazards andsocio-economic factors have been identified to contribute to climate migration flows?In their review of the empirical literature, Kaczan and Orgill-Meyer (2020) provide a framework thatdivides climate hazards into two broad categories\u2014slow onset (e.g. aridification, sea-level rise, etc) and rapidonset (e.g. floods, tropical storms, etc). While this is a useful structure to consider the effects of climatehazards on migration, more broadly, we conducted our analysis with climate hazards such as heat, droughts,and floods that occur across a range of timescales while also paying attention to socio-economic and culturalfactors such as place attachment. We expect this review to provide some ground clearing for modeling future\u00a9 2024 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing LtdEnviron. Res.: Climate 3 (2024) 042002 A Ivanova et alprojections of climate-induced migration and guidance for future research, planning, and policy efforts toidentify populations rendered vulnerable and support their adaptation to climate change.Several reviews on the topic of climate change and migration have been conducted, though there areimportant gaps. Falco et al (2018) focused on the extent to which agriculture acts as a mediating channellinking climate change to migration, while Moore and Wesselbaum (2023) extensively reviewed climatemigration literature by dividing climate variables as driving forces of migration and channels, specificallyhighlighting the effect of temperature on migration. However, these studies only reviewed economics-centricand/or quantitative studies, excluding the literature that used qualitative methods. Qualitative methods areneeded to develop an understanding of why people migrate or adapt in place, to address power imbalancesbetween researchers and migrants, or to unpack discourses that have the potential to result in real materialimpacts on migrants (Van Praag 2021).Other reviews, such as those by Beine and Jeusette (2021), Hoffmann et al (2021), and Piguet (2022)provide comprehensive meta-analyses of the climate-migration literature, and Klepp (2017) offers anextensive overview of climate justice and policy options. These reviews are highly focused on specific hazardslike drought and heat. While some reviews consider the context in which each of the selected studies wasconducted, our review places greater emphasis on the locations, social conditions, and economiccircumstances of the studies. Many of the previous reviews also do not consider the risks posed by otherclimate hazards, such as salinization and wildfires.Our study, however, offers an in-depth discussion of climate hazards and detailed attention to eachreviewed study and the context in which it was conducted. We also broadened the scope of climate hazardsby including previously overlooked factors such as tropical storms and wildfires, while narrowing our focusto empirical research. More importantly, our review brings a novel contribution to the climate migrationscholarship by focusing on hazards from climate extreme and their influence on human migration. Finally,our review is not only limited to quantitative studies but includes a variety of qualitative studies, followingBoas et al (2019) suggestions to center the perspectives of affected populations, explaining people\u2019s ownreasoning for their mobility or immobility. Consequently, in this paper, we have reviewed place attachmentin depth, which has been either neglected in previous reviews or not given enough attention.Note that within the mobilities literature, \u2018nature\u2019 or the \u2018environment\u2019 has been secondary to theunderstanding of mobility, and not the \u2018material substance through which mobility itself is mediated,experienced, and conceptualized\u2019 (Baldwin et al 2019, p 290). The literature on migration since the late 1980shas paid little attention to causal environmental factors. The following explains this trend: (1) It has beenargued that the influence of nature on human life would attenuate with technological progress, which wouldprovide humans with the tools to control our environment; (2) Marxist perspectives and socio-culturalapproaches progressively replaced environment-centric explanations of migration that were critiqued forbeing deterministic; (3) economic paradigms became central in migration theory, right from those inspiredby Marxism to neo-classical thinking; and (4) the literature on forced migration studies emphasized the roleof the state in the production of the refugee crisis over environmentally-induced displacements (Piguet et al2011). However, given inequities in access to attenuating technologies as well as similar inequities in politicaland economic power, one cannot ignore environmental considerations. Therefore, there is a need to reconcilejustice concerns while taking climate change and its impacts on the materiality of social relations seriously.The concept of \u2018mobility justice\u2019 offers an alternative framing to analyze the relationship between climatehazards and human mobility. This framework integrates environmental factors into contemporary migrationanalysis, focusing on power imbalances and inequitable distribution of energy and transportation, allowingfor a better understanding of the uneven movement of people, non-humans, objects, and information(Sheller 2018, Baldwin et al 2019). Our review is compatible with such analyses, despite not being explicitlyframed as such, as we review both environmental and social factors affecting climate-based migration.To address such gaps in previous research and contribute beyond what has been studied, we adapted theKaczan and Orgill-Meyer (2020) framework to systematically categorize climate hazards and their impact onmigration; we also included papers that draw on mixed methods and qualitative research, expanding theliterature review\u2019s scope. Other studies, such as those by Priovashini and Mallick (2022) and Zander et al(2023), presented a bibliometric review and topic modeling of the existing research on climate migration.They revealed key trends in publication metrics such as citation counts, co-authorship network analysis,lexical network analysis, topic clustering, and research gaps. Our research, in contrast, had a differentpurpose, which is to conduct an in-depth analysis and synthesis of the selected studies rather than focusingon publication metrics and trends. Our review reveals a greater number of climate-related factors, such as2Environ. Res.: Climate 3 (2024) 042002 A Ivanova et altropical storms, and wildfires, unexamined in previous reviews, and we also elaborated on such factors asfloods and droughts in more depth. We also provide a more detailed discussion on the role of placeattachment in climate migration relationships. This approach allowed us to gain an in-depth understandingof selected literature and climate hazards instead of simple evidence summation.In section 2, we outline our search strategy, the criteria used for selecting the studies in this literaturereview, a discussion of the methodology of these studies, and the geography of case studies. In section 3, wepresent our findings on the specific climatic and non-climate factors identified in studies that influencemigration, such as precipitation, floods, droughts, tropical storms, temperature, erosion, sea level rise,wildfires, salinization, and place attachment. Climatic hazards specifically refer to the occurrence of a naturalor human-induced physical event or long-term trend that has the potential to cause negative impacts onhuman and natural systems such as loss of life, injury, and loss of property, infrastructure, livelihoods, serviceprovision, ecosystems, and environmental resources (IPCC 2022). Finally, we conclude by summarizing thekey findings of this review, identifying both research gaps and future directions, and discussing somelimitations.2. Methods2.1. Search strategy and selection criteriaWe conducted a comprehensive review of quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods research on humanmigration and a suite of climate hazards. We developed a search strategy informed by and building uponprevious literature reviews (Kaczan and Orgill-Meyer 2020, Ghosh and Orchiston 2022). Additionally, wedeveloped a list of search criteria for our literature review, along with categories of select climate hazards.Searches based on these criteria were performed using AGRICOLA (EBSCO), JSTOR Libraries, GoogleScholar, Web of Science, and ResearchGate databases. We focused on literature published since 2010.Table 1 outlines the inclusion and exclusion criteria, which were applied to each study. The search wasconcluded in five stages\u2014article search, study selection, initial review, full text review, and analysis (figure 1).All the selected studies were then considered for detailed review.2.2. Study populationsTarget populations spanned 26 countries with nine studies that were global in scope. Figure 2 shows thenumber of case-studies focused on each country, including: Bangladesh (n= 8), the USA (n= 8), BurkinaFaso (n= 3), Fiji (n= 3), India (n= 3), Mexico (n= 3), Nigeria (n= 3), Ghana (n= 2), Pakistan (n= 2),Vietnam (n= 2), Brazil (n= 1), China (n= 1), Ecuador (n= 1), Honduras (n= 1), Indonesia (n= 1), theMaldives (n= 1), Mongolia (n= 1), Nepal (n= 1), the Philippines (n= 1), Solomon Islands (n= 1), SouthAfrica (n= 1), Syria (n= 1), Tanzania (n= 1), Tuvalu (n= 1), Uganda (n= 1), Vanuatu (n= 1). Selectedpapers studied precipitation changes (n= 22), temperature changes (n= 20), multiple climate hazards(n= 15), droughts (n= 9), floods (n= 5), storms (n= 4), erosion (n= 3), sea level rise (n= 3), wildfires(n= 3), salinization (n= 3), and explored other socio-economic factors related to climate change migrationand place attachment (n= 5).A majority of the reviewed studies examined migration in the recent decades (1960\u20132020), althoughthree studies did not state the study period. Participant populations ranged from 19 interviewees to 550 473households. Overall, 44 publications were quantitative, 12 were qualitative and two used a mixed-methodsapproach. Quantitative methods were used for analyzing the influence of climate and non-climate hazardson migration and forecasting future migration trends and included modeling and regression methods suchas agent-based model, Poisson regression model, ordinary least squares regression, multivariate logisticregression, survival prediction model, augmented gravity model, Poisson pseudo maximum likelihoodmodel, unobserved components model, grouped fixed-effects model, linear probability model, multinomiallogit model; and statistical analysis methods such as one-way test of variance (ANOVA), t-test, andresidential sorting model. Qualitative methods were used to provide in-depth insights into the humandimensions of climate migration and included focus groups, interviews, surveys, observations, archivalresearch, secondary sources, and popular media source analysis.3Environ.

ResultsWe review the key findings in the literature on the impact of climate hazards on migration, both within andacross international borders. Table 2 presents a summary of all reviewed papers, along with their findingsand the climate hazards studied.3.1. Multiple climate hazardsSeveral authors examined a combination of climate hazards in aggregate to assess the overall impact ofclimate hazards on migration. Climate hazards refer to environmental phenomena that have the potential toaffect societies and the human environment (FEMA 2023). While FEMA\u2019s National Risk Index enumerates 18types of such hazards, these studies focused primarily on floods, storms, droughts, landslides, andearthquakes as key drivers of migration (FEMA 2023).Research has revealed a complex relationship between climate hazards and migration patterns. Beine andParsons\u2019 (2017) studied the long-term impact of different climate hazards on migration worldwide andfound that, climate hazards including droughts, extreme temperatures, floods, storms led to an increase indomestic migration to urban areas but decreased the rates of international migration. Moreover,international migration has usually happened regionally to neighboring countries or those with priorcolonial links. They also found that income levels played a crucial role in the ability of residents affected byclimate hazards to migrate. Similarly, in Nepal, Gentle et al (2018) showed that climate change and hazardsthat increased weather variability pushed households to adapt through domestic and internationalmigration, but this process increased vulnerabilities among poor households. Still, their findings showedlittle evidence of a significant connection between climate hazards and international migration.Some findings suggest that migration decisions may be influenced by a broader range of climate hazardsthan previously considered, emphasizing that migration decisions are influenced not merely by theoccurrence of a disaster but by its severity. In the U.S., Shumway et al (2014) found that exposure to frequent,severe environmental hazards affected household decisions to migrate -especially in counties thatexperienced the greatest impacts from such hazards where economic conditions and declining populationsexacerbated the issue. Sheldon and Zhan (2022) found that climate hazards such as hurricanes, floods, andcoastal storms increased migration rates, but the likelihood of migration was highly dependent on incomelevels, as low-income households were more likely to remain in place, even with limited aid. Trinh et al(2021) also focus on the severity of climate disasters such as storms, floods, cyclones, landslides, and itsrelationship to household migration decisions in Vietnam from 2006 to 2008. They showed that both low-and high-income households were more likely to make migration decisions following major disasterscorrelated with the intensity of the climate event.In a study of the impact of various climate hazards including drought, flood, storm, wildfire, and extremetemperature in 90 countries, Bekaert et al (2021) found that climate hazards were likely to encourageindividuals to move locally, either within the country or within the same subcontinent. Groeschl andSteinwachs (2017) examined the impact of climate hazards such as storms, droughts, floods, andtemperature anomalies on international migration in 162 countries from 1980 to 2010 and found a linkbetween medium- to long-term international migration and climate hazards mainly in middle-incomecountries. Finally, a study by Kniveton et al (2012) in Burkina Faso revealed the nonlinear nature ofclimate-change-related migration, showing that the influence of climate change on migration appeared andstrengthened with rising population growth.Even non-sedentary populations might see shifts in migration patterns. Migratory herders, who maintaina unique and close connection to the land and often lead isolated lives, present a particularly complex case. Ina study of migratory pastoralism in Northern Pakistan, Joshi et al (2013) revealed that climate fluctuationsand changes forced herders to adapt by altering their migration patterns and diversifying their livelihoods.On a broader scale, the consequences of climate change require coordinated responses. Managedrelocation is one such response. In Fiji, studies by McMichael et al (2019) and Piggott-McKellar et al (2019)highlight how climate change hazards led to short-distance planned relocations of coastal villages with thesupport of the Fijian government, international donors, and other organizations. However, organizedrelocation was a rare response to climate hazards among the selected studies. In both the Solomon Islandsand the USA cases described by Albert et al (2017), migration occurred in response to rapid impacts ofclimate change, such as erosion and flooding, and was compounded by government inaction in organizingmanaged relocations.Some studies found that social connections, place attachment, and other socio-economic-cultural factorsalso affect decisions to stay in areas exposed to climate hazards. In a study of 200 households in Bangladesh,Mallick et al (2022) identified a strong unwillingness to migrate, despite the presence of slow-onset climate5Environ.

The reluctance to migratehappens due to land ownership, social connectedness, and household economic strength, among others.Further complicating the understanding of climate-induced migration is the work of Bohra-Mishra et al(2014) on Indonesian households. The authors found that episodic climate hazards such as floods andlandslides only promoted temporary and short-distance migration, and not permanent and long-distancemigration. Likewise, Gussmann and Hinkel (2021) provided different explanations when comparing twopost-tsunami relocations in the Maldives\u2014specifically a full relocation for Kalhaidhoo island and a partialrelocation for Mundoo island. They found that, despite the high coastal vulnerability due to sea-level rise,relocation outcomes depended on politics and power dynamics rather than adaptation considerations.Collectively, these studies highlight the differential impacts of various climate hazards on migrationwithin and across international borders. Both severity and frequency of climate hazards correlate with ahigher likelihood of migration. However, domestic and international migration do not uniformly respond toclimate hazards, as the reviewed studies generally emphasize that household income levels, place attachment,the societal and political conditions in the affected region, as well as a history of connections betweensending and receiving countries, significantly influence the climate hazard-migration relationship.3.2. Precipitation changesA clear link between long-term precipitation change and migration patterns has been well-documented, butthe influence of socio-economic factors cannot be discounted. For example, a case study in South Africa(Mastrorillo et al 2016) found that both positive and negative precipitation anomalies contributed to anincrease in migration, especially in districts characterized by higher employment in agriculture. Mastrorilloet al (2016) attribute this strong relationship to agriculture which acts as a transmission channel throughwhich rainfall anomalies affect migration. Black and low-income populations in the region, as well as thoseinvolved in agriculture, were found to be particularly vulnerable to precipitation anomalies, responding with10Environ. Res.: Climate 3 (2024) 042002 A Ivanova et alincreased migration. Mastrorillo et al (2016) attribute this relationship to a consequence of the apartheid;Black South Africans are largely located on some of the most marginal agricultural lands, which makes themmore vulnerable to climate change.Gray and Bilsborrow (2013) demonstrate that a long-term increase in precipitation led to higher rates ofdomestic migration in rural Ecuador. This is because above-average precipitation during the dry seasonenabled people to increase income through agriculture, facilitating their move to more prosperous areas.Additionally, Call and Gray\u2019s (2020) findings in Uganda revealed that long-term precipitation increasesprovided similar households with additional resources, allowing them to engage in migration for similarreasons\u2014i.e. better living conditions, education, and other opportunities. Research on rural households inIndia revealed that international migration, as well as rural to urban migration, was also associated withsignificant increase in precipitation due to the substantial impact of precipitation anomalies on agriculture,the main income source for these households. Cottier and Salehyan (2021), in their cross-country study,confirm that in agriculturally reliant countries disproportionately located in Sub-Saharan Africa (23countries), higher levels of precipitation led to increased migration to the European Union countries becausewetter-than-usual conditions enhanced the resources available to households. Similarly, in their long-termstudy on Indonesian households, Bohra-Mishra et al (2014) revealed that household annual migrationprobability increased with a rise in annual precipitation from 2.3 to 3.3 m across all provinces. Another studyby Nawrotzki et al (2016) in Burkina Faso and Senegal showed how the impact of precipitation differed evenwithin neighboring countries. They found that excessive precipitation resulted in international migration,but this trend was observed to be stronger in Senegal due to a high reliance of the most impactedcommunities in Senegal on agriculture. In contrast to these studies, Delazeri et al (2022) study in theNortheast region of Brazil showed that an increase in days with less than 1 mm of precipitation led to adecrease in rural-to-urban migration. This decrease was observed in areas with both the lowest and highestlevels of agricultural income. In other words, regardless of the income level, low levels of precipitationlimited rural-to-urban migration.However, the relationship between increased precipitation and migration is not necessarily direct andlinear. Cattaneo and Massetti (2015) identified a significant U-shaped relationship between wet-seasonprecipitation and migration decisions among agricultural households in Nigeria and Ghana, where migrationpropensity was highest at 125 mm/month of precipitation during the wet season for farming households andturned negative when precipitation exceeded 225 mm/month. Call et al (2017) showed that migrationdecreased during periods of extreme precipitation in Bangladesh. Nonetheless, it consistently increasedduring periods of typical precipitation conditions. They attribute these findings to the fact that agriculturallydependent households experienced crop loss due to riverine flooding during increased precipitationresulting in insufficient resources to migrate. Beine and Parsons\u2019 (2017) cross-country study demonstratedthat short-term precipitation changes decreased international migration from middle-income countries butdid not influence migration from poorer countries, where financial barriers impacted migration. Janes\u2019(2010) study, in Mongolia\u2019s rural counties, focused on changes in precipitation patterns, which, whencoupled with the lack of rural development, amplified livelihood insecurity that increased urban migration.Other socio-economic factors, such as social capital-mediated adaptation and migration patterns, werefound to influence the relationship between precipitation and migration. Leyk et al (2017) found thatprecipitation deficits strongly influenced migration decisions in Mexico\u2014more so for domestic migrationthan international migration. However, the stronger impact of precipitation changes on domestic migration,they argue, could be due to factors such as strict border laws with the U.S. or the high cost of internationalmigration. Another study in rural Mexico, by Nawrotzki et al (2015), suggests that while initial waves ofmigration were influenced by precipitation, later waves were less climate-sensitive due to established socialnetworks at the destination. Moreover, international migration has usually been directed regionally toneighboring countries or those with prior colonial links (Beine and Parsons 2017). These relationships varyconsiderably across regions and appear to be nonlinear. For example, Thiede et al (2016) studied the impactof climate variability on migration in eight South American countries. They found varying responses tonegative, short-term changes in precipitation. For example, such changes resulted in a\u223c68% increase ininter-province migration odds in Colombia, but only a 7.0% increase in Chile.However, not every study reviewed established a link between precipitation and migration. For example,Martinez-Zarzoso\u2019s (2020) research on migration flows did not attribute a significant association betweenthe population-weighted local precipitation and migration across 142 countries with considerableheterogeneity between countries. Similarly, Abu et al (2014) discovered that despite the obvious recognitionof precipitation changes as a serious stressor by communities of Bouko and Bofie-Banda in Ghana, thesechanges did not directly explain their migration intentions. Mueller et al (2014) contributed to this complexnarrative by demonstrating that in Pakistan, excessive precipitation did not have a significant impact onmigration because rainfall did not necessarily lead to a negative income shock for households. While Gray11Environ. Res.: Climate 3 (2024) 042002 A Ivanova et alet al (2020) discovered that in China, before the year 2000, short-term decreases in precipitation initially ledto an increase in temporary migration; this trend gradually reversed over time likely due to enhancedadaptation capacities of rural households such as crop adaptation and livelihood diversification. Feng et al(2012) looked at climate-driven changes in crop yields and migration in the US and revealed that the impactsof precipitation changes on migration are relatively small as migration rates never exceeded 2%. Similarresults were identified in agricultural households in India (Dallmann and Millock 2017) and Tanzania(Chegere and Mrosso 2022).The reviewed studies on precipitation revealed contrasting migration responses to precipitation changesacross different regions. Additionally, the duration of precipitation changes, particularly long-term changes,correlates with increases in migration. Many studies also emphasized the nonlinearity ofprecipitation-migration relationships, which evidence suggests is mediated and sometimes mitigated bysocio-economic factors.3.3. FloodsAs is the case with precipitation, we found mixed evidence of the influence of flooding on migrationdecisions. Four studies emphasized the role of flooding in migration decisions (Berlemann and Tran 2020,Bekaert et al 2021, Ekoh et al 2022). However, two earlier studies indicated that floods were not as importantin explaining migration (Call et al 2017, Dallmann and Millock 2017).In Vietnam, Berlemann and Tran (2020) found that communities with increasing severity or frequency offlooding experienced significantly increased domestic migration from the affected region. Furthermore, theyfound that communities perceiving that flooding events have become more severe over the last decadeshowed higher rates of migration. Ekoh et al (2022) found a positive correlation between flood riskperceptions and migration intentions in Lagos, Nigeria. More broadly, Bekaert et al (2021) found asignificant connection between floods and international migration across 90 countries in Africa, LatinAmerica and the Caribbean, Asia, North America, Europe, and Oceania. Oyekale (2013) found that lack ofalternative occupation increased vulnerability risks when flooding occurs; this means that individuals whoonly have one type of job or who lack any job skills are especially vulnerable to the effects climate change.However, Call et al (2017) in a similar study in Bangladesh suggested that the relationships betweenflooding and migration were inconsistent. They found that migration initially decreased following flooding,then, later, returned to normal levels due to food insecurity caused by sudden floods. Dallmann andMillock\u2019s (2017) study on precipitation anomalies in India showed that floods had low importance inexplaining long-term domestic migration.The existing body of research presents mixed evidence on the impact of floods on migration. While halfof the studies emphasizes the significant connection, the other half indicates that this relationship is neitherconsistent nor significant. Once again, it is likely that socio-economic considerations mediate or mitigate theeffects presented by climate pressures.3.4. DroughtsThe importance of drought studies is notable in research examining the effects of climate change onmigration. Dallmann and Millock (2017) demonstrated that droughts significantly influenced domesticmigration in India. For every month of drought experienced in an origin state during five years, there was a1.5% average increase in the migration rate between different states within India nationally and 1.7% inagricultural areas. In Syria, Ash and Obradovich (2020) primarily focused on political conflicts. However,they provided evidence suggesting that droughts spurred domestic migration from the affected regions, butthey did not analyze the extent to which out-migration contributed to the observed population change.McMichael et al (2023) examined three case studies and found that irregular rainfall and extreme heattriggered droughts in Burkina Faso, leading to food insecurity and the seasonal migration of men, while theirwives and children remained behind. Similarly, in Bangladesh, droughts reduced agricultural employmentopportunities, forcing adults to move to urban centers, increasing their own vulnerability and that of theirfamily members who remained behind (McMichael et al 2023). Meanwhile, in Vietnam, Berlemann and Tran(2020) observed that recent droughts typically resulted in temporary domestic migration, while severe,recurring droughts led to permanent migration from the affected areas. In rural Ecuador, Gray andBilsborrow (2013) observed that exposure to droughts led to an increase in international migration but adecrease in domestic migration. They explained that domestic migrants typically came from agriculturalhouseholds. The scarcity of resources, intensified by droughts that negatively impacted their primary sourceof income\u2014agriculture\u2014influenced these migration patterns.Two studies in Mexico and Senegal found contrasting results of the droughts on international migration.Hunter et al (2013) suggested that in Mexico, the recentness of a drought, coupled with household migrationhistory and a broad social network, collectively determined their migration ability. In other words,12Environ. Res.: Climate 3 (2024) 042002 A Ivanova et alhouseholds that were recently affected by drought and had strong social networks and a history of migrationwere more likely to migrate internationally to the US. However, Nawrotzki et al (2016) showed that droughtsled to a decrease in international migration from Senegal, especially in areas with acute undernutrition. Thissuggests that as with precipitation and floods, international migration due to drought has a cost that must beovercome.Bekaert et al (2021) conducted an expansive study on migration intentions via Gallup World Polls surveyacross 90 countries, which indicated that droughts increased domestic migration intentions. Overall, theirfindings emphasized that the strongest drought-related intentions to migrate outside the country of originwere seen in low- and middle-income countries in Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean, while inhigher income regions such intentions were largely limited to domestic migration. However, Cottier andSalehyan (2021) found little evidence that droughts increased migration flows to the European Union (EU)from non-EU countries. Particularly, they showed that in agriculturally dependent countries, droughts wereassociated with an immediate decrease of out-migration due to decreased household income.To summarize, droughts have a significant relationship with migration. However, the effect of droughtson migration is mediated and mitigated by socio-economic factors such as food insecurity, agriculturalemployment, social networks, income levels, and household migration history.3.5. Tropical stormsThere is evidence that climate change increases both the frequency and severity of tropical storms (IPCC2023a). Current research on the impact of tropical storms on migration does not specifically address theimpact of climate change beyond considering how the frequency and intensity of events might influencemigration. We reviewed four current, but limited studies in nascent literature.Mahajan and Yang\u2019s (2020) study on the impact of hurricanes on international migration to the UnitedStates from 1980 to 2004 showed that hurricanes increased migration on average, especially where themigration pattern to the U.S. was already established. Griffith\u2019s (2020) qualitative research on migration inPuerto Rico and Honduras as a result of hurricanes identified such migration as a strategy to enhancelivelihood and reduce risk.In a more localized context, a study by Sastry and Gregory (2014) on the migration patterns of NewOrleans residents post-Hurricane Katrina showed that while hurricanes can prompt migration, their effectsvary among individuals. Specifically, they found that 53% of those affected did not permanently migratefrom New Orleans, while those who did typically moved elsewhere within Louisiana or to neighboring Texas.Research on typhoons in Vietnam by Berlemann and Tran (2020) focused exclusively on temporaryinternal migration using household panel data compared to storm data provided by the National Oceanicand Atmospheric Administration. While they did not study permanent internal migration, they found thattropical storms acted as a \u2018push\u2019 increasing the likelihood of temporary migration within a household as wellas increasing the number of household members who migrate temporarily. However, the authors cautionthat temporary migration is already a trending strategy for enhancing livelihood but avoiding the high cost ofpermanent urban migration in Vietnam.Generally, there is some evidence for the impact of storm activity on temporary migration, but thestrength of the effect varies by region and community. However, there is a lack of evidence regarding theimpact of tropical storms on permanent migration. One common pattern observed in these studies is thesignificant impact of historical migration patterns and existing migrant populations in the targeted areas,which compel increased migration after hurricanes.3.6. TemperatureAmong all the studies in this review that examined the relationship between temperature change andmigration, four were cross-country analyses. Thiede et al (2016) discovered that monthly short-termtemperature increases impacted inter-provincial migration in eight South American countries. Moreglobally, temperature increases have been shown to boost out-migration among agricultural workers (Cottierand Salehyan 2021) and low-skilled laborers (Helbling and Meierrieks 2021) mostly from warmer countriesalready experiencing high baseline levels of heat stress and countries highly dependent on agriculture. Inparticular, Martinez-Zarzoso (2020) found that a gradual increase in temperature caused more people tomigrate internationally. For every 1% increase in local temperature, migration rates rose by 0.5% from 142countries to 19 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development countries.In Pakistan, Mueller et al (2014) captured the strong positive relationship between high temperatures andmigration due to the financial hardships of farming under increasingly hot temperatures. Their study alsodistinguished gender-specific migration trends, particularly that men tended to migrate long-term, whilewomen chose short-term migration. Additionally, the study also showed that poorer households were morelikely to migrate compared to wealthier ones. Similar results were identified by case studies in Indonesia13Environ. Res.: Climate 3 (2024) 042002 A Ivanova et al(Bohra-Mishra et al 2014), South Africa (Mastrorillo et al 2016), and Northeastern Brazil (Delazeri et al2022). Janes\u2019 (2010) qualitative study of Mongolian pastoral communities revealed that climate change, interms of temperature extremes in rural areas of Mongolia, together with the lack of rural development,intensified livelihood insecurity and increased urban migration. Temperature increases were also correlatedwith increases in rural to urban migration in studies conducted in rural India (Sedova and Kalkuhl 2020)and Uganda (Call and Gray 2020).The impact of rising temperatures on migration decisions is not exclusive to poorer households. Forexample, Fan et al (2016) looked at how extreme weather affected household location preferences across theUnited States and found a link between brain-drain and extreme temperatures. In other words, highlyqualified workers migrated away from regions affected by extreme temperature increases.As with other climate related factors, the relationship between temperature increases andmigration\u2014especially international migration\u2014is mediated and mitigated by socio-economic factors.Sedova and Kalkuhl (2020) showed that rural-rural and international migration decreased in areasexperiencing temperature extremes, despite an increase in rural-urban migration. This could be due togeographically correlated weather shocks in nearby rural areas and financial constraints affectinginternational migration especially since climate migrants are likely to come from households stronglydependent on agricultural production or low-skill laboring work. Similar findings were discovered inBurkina Faso (Nawrotzki et al 2016). In rural Mexico, Nawrotzki et al (2015) observed that the probability ofinternational migration increased the most with rising temperatures for households that have access tocommunity migrant networks. Beine and Parsons (2017) in their cross-country study, found short-termtemperature changes decreased international migration from middle-income countries but had no effect onmigration from poorer countries, suggesting income levels and migration costs remain relevant.The association between temperature increase or decrease and migration is not always straightforward.For example, Cattaneo and Massetti (2015) showed a U-shaped relationship between migration propensityand temperature during the dry season among farming households in Nigeria and Ghana becausetemperature anomalies can impact the profitability of agriculture and migration requires resources. Similarresults were identified by Cai et al (2016). In the U.S., Feng et al (2012) studied the connection betweenclimate-driven changes in crop yields and migration and revealed that the agricultural-related migration wasdriven by temperature. This relationship is nonlinear because temperature impacts on crop yields are alsononlinear. Their findings showed that a 1% decrease in yields of corn and soybeans in the rural U.S. countiesof the Corn Belt led to a 0.17% net reduction of the population through migration. However, this responsewas not observed in eastern counties outside the Corn Belt. Gray et al (2020) discovered that in China,short-term temperature anomalies, like precipitation changes (discussed earlier), increased permanentmigration prior to the year 2000, and then after 2000 a short-term increase in temperature resulted in adecrease in permanent migration. As with precipitation changes, they attributed this shift to the changingsocial and economic context. Finally, research conducted by Chegere and Mrosso (2022) on agriculturalhouseholds in Tanzania explained that temperature deviations may not be the push factor driving temporarymigration in agricultural households. Instead, the authors attributed temporary migration to incomediversification when no other adaptation alternatives were available.Reviewed studies on temperature as a driver of climate migration had a consensus about the significanceof this relationship; however, the complexity of the relationship varies across regions. This complexity isshaped by socio-economic factors such as gender, social ties, educational or skill levels, the agriculturaldependency of households, and aspects of agriculture.3.7. ErosionErosion, marked by the loss of land, poses significant challenges worldwide, particularly in areas housingaffected coastal and riverine communities. Unlike other disasters, existing literature on erosion indicates aconsistently positive connection between erosion and migration. However, this research is very limited.Moreover, how the previously discussed factors are linked to erosion is another question that should bepursued.Bernzen et al (2019) found that the likelihood of migration in Bangladesh increased with the loss ofarable land. Bohra-Mishra et al (2014) found that for every 1% rise in deaths and houses lost to landslides inIndonesia, the probability of households migrating each year increased by 0.0006% and 0.0004%,respectively. Alam et al (2020) in Bangladesh adopted a slightly different approach, suggesting that migrationwas a non-direct consequence of riverbank erosion coupled with associated climatic challenges. Theyattributed this to the the reduced access to essentials such as food, water, electricity, education, healthcare,and jobs followed by the loss of land. They noted that migration due to erosion took a variety of forms,including both permanent and temporary, within and outside of the migrants\u2019 originating communities.14Environ. Res.: Climate 3 (2024) 042002 A Ivanova et al3.8. Sea level riseThree studies identified sea level rise as one of the causes of migration (Hauer 2017, Jamero et al 2017,Adams and Kay 2019). In Bangladesh, Adams and Kay (2019) showed that sea level rise did not directlyimpact migration; downstream hazards from sea-level rise such as increases in sunny day flooding or stormsurge flooding drove climate migration. However, this type of migration depends on the heterogeneity of theexposed population. Similarly, Hauer\u2019s (2017) analysis of the likely migration destinations of the USpopulation revealed that a 1.8 m sea level rise would cause net migration in every state, affecting 86% of USCore Based Statistical Areas and 56% of US counties. Conversely, research by Jamero et al (2017) in thePhilippines presented different evidence. Their study showed that island residents preferred on-islandadaptive strategies over relocation to the mainland, even in the face of rising sea levels.Sea-level rise is widely recognized as the main consequence of climate change (Eyring et al 2021).However, due to its gradual effect, the impact of sea-level rise on migration cannot be comprehendedimmediately. Thus, it is increased exposure to coastal hazards that drives migration instead. Anotherphenomenon, not exclusive to sea-level rise but observed across various indicators of climate change isnon-migration. In some cases, social capital and a sense of identity, often reflected in the determination tosecure traditional livelihoods, strengthened the community\u2019s desire to remain in affected areas instead ofmigrating in the Philippines (Jamero et al 2017).3.9. WildfiresThe literature on the subject of wildfires and migration is limited and mixed. Nawrotzki et al (2014)conducted a survey of residents in the wildland-urban interface of Boulder and Larimer counties inColorado, two months after the Fourmile Canyon fire in 2010. Out of 428 respondents, only 4% expressedany intention to relocate due to the risk of future wildfires; the majority of them planned to move withinclose proximity to maintain social bonds. In Ghana, Abu et al (2014) observed that households affected bybushfires were more likely to migrate to other places in search of employment opportunities. They link thispattern to the fact that bushfires often resulted from irregular rainfall and droughts and potential impact oncrop yields. These combined climate and socio-economic factors contributed to migration. In contrast, in across- country analysis, Bekaert et al (2021) observed a negative significant effect of wildfires on domesticmigration across 90 countries in Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, Asia, North America, Europe, andOceania.While these studies do not present uniform conclusion, they suggest that the impact of wildfires onmigration depends on socio-economic factors and possibly the strength of existing social ties. There is also astronger migration trend from regions where wildfires occur alongside other climate hazards.3.10. SalinizationAccording to Chen and Mueller\u2019s (2018) study of 550 473 Bangladeshi households, mild salinity contributesto decisions to migrate, while extreme salinity had a direct negative impact on international migration.However, Bernzen et al (2019) learned that salinization issues had a negligible positive and non-significantassociation with migration in Bangladesh. In neighboring India, a study by Sengupta and Samanta (2022) inGobardhanpur village found that people did not migrate despite the salinization of the land. The high soilsalinity only forced them to adjust and shift from agriculture to fishing (Sengupta and Samanta 2022).3.11. Place attachmentResearchers have examined the relationship between place attachment, defined as a unique emotional andcultural connection that an individual develops with a place (Stedman 2003), and the decision to migrate inthe face of climate change across a variety of geographical and cultural settings. Non-migration andadaptation in place, due to place attachment, are issues that are often addressed in this literature. Five studiesshowed that a strong place attachment makes a person reluctant to migrate (Penning-Rowsell et al 2013,Marino and Lazrus 2015, Perumal 2018, Adams and Kay 2019, Sengupta and Samanta 2022).Marino and Lazrus\u2019 (2015) comparative study offers insights into the migration responses to climatehazards in Shishmaref, Alaska, and Nanumea, Tuvalu, where they are not unidirectional, but have a cyclicalcharacter and always occurred between urban and rural areas, either on an annual basis or throughout alifetime. They attribute this to a strong attachment to place and the need of these communities to engage intraditional rural practices such as subsistence harvesting, hunting, local celebrations, and food trading.Similarly, Sengupta and Samanta\u2019s (2022) research in the Indian village of Gobardhanpur provided evidencethat place attachment can be relatively more influential than economic or climate factors in migrationdecisions. These studies are consistent with earlier findings by Penning-Rowsell et al (2013), who, throughfocus group research in 10 Bangladeshi villages, observed that migration was often seen as the last option forthe affected population; when Bangladeshi villagers migrate, it was regionally, among a small group of15Environ. Res.: Climate 3 (2024) 042002 A Ivanova et alpeople, and temporary. This emotional resistance to migration was also observed in the Pacific Islandcommunity of Vanuatu, where Perumal (2018) demonstrated how a strong attachment to place made theVanuatu community resilient to migration because they had built resilience through adaptation,preparedness, and response resources. Complementing these studies, Adams and Kay\u2019s (2019) research with1500 households in coastal Bangladesh explored the role of place attachment and rootedness in migrationdecisions. They found that despite having low adaptive capacity, coastal communities in Bangladesh wereresistant to relocating due to strong emotional and social ties to their places of origin.Across many geographic and cultural environments, the common factor is the significant influence ofplace attachment. The emotional connection between the place affected by climate hazards and theindividual sometimes outweighs economic and environmental pressures. Even when migration occurs, ittends to occur temporarily and regionally.4. DiscussionIn this article, we focused on climate hazards and human migration. However, we recognize, drawing on thepreviously discussed mobility justice scholarship, that the decision to migrate is as much about climatechange as it is about existing societal inequities and other stressors, such as unequal land and capital access,gender inequality, colonialism, economic disparities, and conflicts. Our position here is that neither can besafely ignored in addressing issues associated with climate-based migration. We view this review as the firststep in the process of reconciling such diverse causes and contributors. Several scholars view climate changein terms of its injustice\u2014those that have contributed the least to causing climate change are being impactedmost severely. As such, we must understand the drivers of such inequity to include migration issues in orderto better address said injustice.In the studies that we analyzed, temperature changes and droughts had the most evidence for drivingmigration. An increase in temperature leads to migration, especially in agriculturally dependent regions.Temperature changes resulted in increased international migration, as well as rural-urban domesticmigration. Droughts had strong relationships with migration, but the direction of this response varies byregion. For example, in rural Ecuador, droughts increased international migration, but in Senegal, they led toa decrease in migration. Reviewed studies revealed a trend that multiple climate hazards collectively tendedto increase domestic migration toward urban areas.In agriculturally reliant regions, changes in precipitation had a direct impact on domestic migration. Inthe United States, Bangladesh, Vietnam, and Burkina Faso, severe and frequent climate hazards such asdroughts and floods had a significant effect on domestic migration. Climate hazards tend to make peoplemore likely to move domestically rather than internationally; however, it is worth noting that affectedpopulations may not be able to migrate internationally due to socio-economic or political constraints such aslimited resources or strict border control (Leyk et al 2017). International migration often happens toneighboring countries or those with previous colonial links or a history of migration. This pattern suggeststhat migrants tend to move to places with closer cultural backgrounds or social ties.Many studies indicate that climate hazards like droughts, floods, and short-term temperature changessignificantly affect agriculture, which is the main source of income in agriculturally reliant regions. Thesehazards often lead to a decline in the overall profitability of agriculture and the loss of jobs, resulting ininsufficient resources for migration. Conversely, conditions such as wetter-than-usual during the dry seasoncan enhance the resources available to households, facilitating an increase in migration. Other climatehazards, including landslides, floods, and storms result in loss of infrastructure of the affected communities,which often necessitate migration.The reviewed literature highlights how socio-economic, political, and cultural factors, including socialconnections at the planned destination, income levels, gender, educational or skill levels, employment type,history of household migration, or political situation (e.g. strict border laws, colonial history, forced orarranged displacement) influence migration patterns. Additionally, research has also emphasized theimportance of place attachment, indicating that people often prefer not to migrate unless they areexperiencing severe stress. Even in such cases, the tendency appears to be to adapt in place rather thanrelocate. Environmental degradation will have a limited impact on the migration patterns of populationswith higher education levels, wealth, and social connectivity, unlike landless households and those withyounger members and few dependents (McLeman and Smit 2004). Impoverished communities may not beable to financially support their plans to migrate and may elect local opportunities for income diversification.This might suggest that strengthening local opportunities for livelihood diversification could reduce the needfor migration. However, it is crucial to understand how climate change impacts regional power dynamics togenerate usable knowledge, which we encourage other scholars to pursue. Finally, the lack of consistency infindings of the reviewed studies are likely associated with differences in research methodologies, diverse16Environ. Res.: Climate 3 (2024) 042002 A Ivanova et alstudy regions, differing time frames, as well as the complexity of the relationships between climate hazardsand migration.Our review revealed a few gaps in the existing research on climate migration. First, such climate changeindicators as tropical storms, salinization, wildfires, and erosion have received relatively limited attention inthe research on climate migration. We encourage researchers to explore these relationships further. Second,current research has paid a lot of attention to Bangladesh, the USA, Burkina Faso, Fiji, India, Mexico, andNigeria, while other countries have received less attention, except in a few cross-country studies. There is aneed for case studies specifically focusing on countries in Central and Western Asia, Africa, Europe, andSouth America. Given the expected increase in migration globally due to climate hazards, there is a need tounderstand the impacts of climate change across all regions of the world. Third, the existing research isleaning towards quantitative or econometric studies, which is a significant limitation, as studies that neglectqualitative methods risk reporting a simplistic picture on climate migration. Future research can integratedifferent methodologies, including quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods, to strengthen the relevanceof findings by incorporating more nuanced perspectives and offer more actionable insights. Qualitativemethods will have a particular significance when examining the role of socio-economic factors in migration.Inclusion of methodologies such as participatory action research is critical for addressing power inequalitiesand co-creating solutions that work for communities Fourth, despite including \u2018health\u2019 as a search term, wedid not find any research specifically addressing healthcare access or physical or mental health impactsrelated to migration. Migrants may face new health risks related to climate change in receiving countries,especially when housing insecurity that often accompanies migration where they are more exposed toclimate and climate-related hazards; knowledge of migrants\u2019 health needs could assist health systems inpreparing to provide appropriate health services (Schwerdtle et al 2018).Fifth, while many of the studies discussed here assume migration as a \u2018rational\u2019 adaptation response, weargue that it is important for critical migration and climate change studies to question this. Adaptationstudies have little to offer in terms of conceptualizing the different forms of power that determine theprocesses through which various social groups are rendered secure or vulnerable to environmental change,thus falling short of historically and analytically grounded analyses that situate socio-ecological relations thatproduce social vulnerability and environmental fragility (Taylor 2014). This is especially true for agrarianenvironments (Agrawal and Sivaramakrishnan 2000), where adaptation studies are bereft of attention to thehistorical roots of vulnerability faced by marginal groups. In the semi-arid Indian Deccan, for example, theparadox of climate change adaptation is that agriculture dotted by small farms is already in crisis because oftightening constraints on profitability, increasing indebtedness, and limitations on means of socialreproduction. Adaptation must connect the regional/micro, or how vulnerability manifests locally, with thesystemic/macro, or the historically constituted power and privilege relations; the consequence of not doingso is to inadvertently render adaptation as a depoliticized concept used to explain how vulnerablecommunities must be protected from climate hazards, but incapable of explaining contentious and complexsocio-ecological relations (Taylor 2014).A major limitation of this review involves the search strategy. Although we did not include secondaryliterature, the widening of the study type would enhance this analysis. Additionally, some of the previousgaps we identified in the existing research might be a consequence of the scarcity of English-languageresearch. We intentionally excluded non-English literature from our review which synchronically limited ourfindings. Future review studies could benefit from exploring research in other languages. This is important asevidence of migration might be documented in other languages since much of the migration is anticipated orthought to occur from and within countries where English might not be the primary language. Weacknowledge that our decision to exclude non-English literature from the review inadvertently privilegespredominantly Western scholarship on the topic, potentially providing a limited perspective on the climatemigration literature. However, we tried to address this limitation in two ways. First, we included studies bythe authors affiliated with the research institutions from the affected regions (many in the Global South).Second, we did not entirely focus on top-down quantitative research, but also included qualitative studiesthat highlight the perspectives of populations living in the affected areas, following Piguet et al (2018).Another limitation of our review is that we coded manually to summarize and categorize the articles. Thisapproach limited the overall number of research articles we could review. Future research can use theunsupervised machine learning text mining method recommended by Zander et al (2023), which will makethe coding process more efficient and could mitigate potential biases.Our research is chiefly focused on climate-sensitive sending areas and not the destination areas wheremigrants tend to land, which does not align with Boas et al (2019). However, the geographically diversereviewed studies in this research that specifically use quantitative modeling methods attend to hostdestinations (Mahajan and Yang 2020, Bekaert et al 2021, Cottier and Salehyan 2021). Additionally, ourin-depth analysis of each selected study in every climate hazard category section with comprehensive17Environ. Res.: Climate 3 (2024) 042002 A Ivanova et alexplanation of the contexts helped highlight the directions of climate mobility. Furthermore, the lack ofunified terminology for the same climate hazards in climate migration research leads to ambiguity. Finally,many countries have recently experienced acute climate disasters coinciding with conflicts, which makes ithard to distinguish the impact of climate change from that of conflict on migration.Data availability statementAll data that support the findings of this study are included within the article (and any supplementaryinformation files).AcknowledgmentsThis article represents an expanded version of research initially undertaken as part of the Climate BasedHuman Migration Project (CHMP) for which the authors gratefully acknowledge seed funding from theOffice of Research at Washington State University.

IntroductionThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) defines climate change as \u2018a change in the state ofthe climate that can be identified by changes in the mean and/or the variability of its properties and thatpersists for an extended period, typically decades or longer\u2019 (IPCC 2023a, Glossary, 122). Although mostresearch on climate migration has focused on the most extreme examples in a small number of mostimpacted nations, climate change is affecting every country (IPCC 2023b, Observed Changes and Impacts).Climate hazards vary by region and while some communities have the capacity to cope with or adapt in placeto slowly occurring climatic changes or extremes depending on the severity of their impacts, otherindividuals or communities migrate to manage the risks posed by climate change and extremes (IPCC2023b). Some scholars view migration as an effective strategy to manage risk (Adger 2006, Black et al 2011,Gemenne and Blocher 2017), while others characterize it as a failure to adapt (Myers 2002, Felli and Castree2012). To inform efforts to manage and mitigate the negative effects of climate migration from thecommunity to the international level, it is critical to understand the factors that force or limit humanmigration when faced with climate hazards. Our central question is: what climate hazards andsocio-economic factors have been identified to contribute to climate migration flows?In their review of the empirical literature, Kaczan and Orgill-Meyer (2020) provide a framework thatdivides climate hazards into two broad categories\u2014slow onset (e.g. aridification, sea-level rise, etc) and rapidonset (e.g. floods, tropical storms, etc). While this is a useful structure to consider the effects of climatehazards on migration, more broadly, we conducted our analysis with climate hazards such as heat, droughts,and floods that occur across a range of timescales while also paying attention to socio-economic and culturalfactors such as place attachment. We expect this review to provide some ground clearing for modeling future\u00a9 2024 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing LtdEnviron. Res.: Climate 3 (2024) 042002 A Ivanova et alprojections of climate-induced migration and guidance for future research, planning, and policy efforts toidentify populations rendered vulnerable and support their adaptation to climate change.Several reviews on the topic of climate change and migration have been conducted, though there areimportant gaps. Falco et al (2018) focused on the extent to which agriculture acts as a mediating channellinking climate change to migration, while Moore and Wesselbaum (2023) extensively reviewed climatemigration literature by dividing climate variables as driving forces of migration and channels, specificallyhighlighting the effect of temperature on migration. However, these studies only reviewed economics-centricand/or quantitative studies, excluding the literature that used qualitative methods. Qualitative methods areneeded to develop an understanding of why people migrate or adapt in place, to address power imbalancesbetween researchers and migrants, or to unpack discourses that have the potential to result in real materialimpacts on migrants (Van Praag 2021).Other reviews, such as those by Beine and Jeusette (2021), Hoffmann et al (2021), and Piguet (2022)provide comprehensive meta-analyses of the climate-migration literature, and Klepp (2017) offers anextensive overview of climate justice and policy options. These reviews are highly focused on specific hazardslike drought and heat. While some reviews consider the context in which each of the selected studies wasconducted, our review places greater emphasis on the locations, social conditions, and economiccircumstances of the studies. Many of the previous reviews also do not consider the risks posed by otherclimate hazards, such as salinization and wildfires.Our study, however, offers an in-depth discussion of climate hazards and detailed attention to eachreviewed study and the context in which it was conducted. We also broadened the scope of climate hazardsby including previously overlooked factors such as tropical storms and wildfires, while narrowing our focusto empirical research. More importantly, our review brings a novel contribution to the climate migrationscholarship by focusing on hazards from climate extreme and their influence on human migration. Finally,our review is not only limited to quantitative studies but includes a variety of qualitative studies, followingBoas et al (2019) suggestions to center the perspectives of affected populations, explaining people\u2019s ownreasoning for their mobility or immobility. Consequently, in this paper, we have reviewed place attachmentin depth, which has been either neglected in previous reviews or not given enough attention.Note that within the mobilities literature, \u2018nature\u2019 or the \u2018environment\u2019 has been secondary to theunderstanding of mobility, and not the \u2018material substance through which mobility itself is mediated,experienced, and conceptualized\u2019 (Baldwin et al 2019, p 290). The literature on migration since the late 1980shas paid little attention to causal environmental factors. The following explains this trend: (1) It has beenargued that the influence of nature on human life would attenuate with technological progress, which wouldprovide humans with the tools to control our environment; (2) Marxist perspectives and socio-culturalapproaches progressively replaced environment-centric explanations of migration that were critiqued forbeing deterministic; (3) economic paradigms became central in migration theory, right from those inspiredby Marxism to neo-classical thinking; and (4) the literature on forced migration studies emphasized the roleof the state in the production of the refugee crisis over environmentally-induced displacements (Piguet et al2011). However, given inequities in access to attenuating technologies as well as similar inequities in politicaland economic power, one cannot ignore environmental considerations. Therefore, there is a need to reconcilejustice concerns while taking climate change and its impacts on the materiality of social relations seriously.The concept of \u2018mobility justice\u2019 offers an alternative framing to analyze the relationship between climatehazards and human mobility. This framework integrates environmental factors into contemporary migrationanalysis, focusing on power imbalances and inequitable distribution of energy and transportation, allowingfor a better understanding of the uneven movement of people, non-humans, objects, and information(Sheller 2018, Baldwin et al 2019). Our review is compatible with such analyses, despite not being explicitlyframed as such, as we review both environmental and social factors affecting climate-based migration.To address such gaps in previous research and contribute beyond what has been studied, we adapted theKaczan and Orgill-Meyer (2020) framework to systematically categorize climate hazards and their impact onmigration; we also included papers that draw on mixed methods and qualitative research, expanding theliterature review\u2019s scope. Other studies, such as those by Priovashini and Mallick (2022) and Zander et al(2023), presented a bibliometric review and topic modeling of the existing research on climate migration.They revealed key trends in publication metrics such as citation counts, co-authorship network analysis,lexical network analysis, topic clustering, and research gaps. Our research, in contrast, had a differentpurpose, which is to conduct an in-depth analysis and synthesis of the selected studies rather than focusingon publication metrics and trends. Our review reveals a greater number of climate-related factors, such as2Environ. Res.: Climate 3 (2024) 042002 A Ivanova et altropical storms, and wildfires, unexamined in previous reviews, and we also elaborated on such factors asfloods and droughts in more depth. We also provide a more detailed discussion on the role of placeattachment in climate migration relationships. This approach allowed us to gain an in-depth understandingof selected literature and climate hazards instead of simple evidence summation.In section 2, we outline our search strategy, the criteria used for selecting the studies in this literaturereview, a discussion of the methodology of these studies, and the geography of case studies. In section 3, wepresent our findings on the specific climatic and non-climate factors identified in studies that influencemigration, such as precipitation, floods, droughts, tropical storms, temperature, erosion, sea level rise,wildfires, salinization, and place attachment. Climatic hazards specifically refer to the occurrence of a naturalor human-induced physical event or long-term trend that has the potential to cause negative impacts onhuman and natural systems such as loss of life, injury, and loss of property, infrastructure, livelihoods, serviceprovision, ecosystems, and environmental resources (IPCC 2022). Finally, we conclude by summarizing thekey findings of this review, identifying both research gaps and future directions, and discussing somelimitations.2. Methods2.1. Search strategy and selection criteriaWe conducted a comprehensive review of quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods research on humanmigration and a suite of climate hazards. We developed a search strategy informed by and building uponprevious literature reviews (Kaczan and Orgill-Meyer 2020, Ghosh and Orchiston 2022). Additionally, wedeveloped a list of search criteria for our literature review, along with categories of select climate hazards.Searches based on these criteria were performed using AGRICOLA (EBSCO), JSTOR Libraries, GoogleScholar, Web of Science, and ResearchGate databases. We focused on literature published since 2010.Table 1 outlines the inclusion and exclusion criteria, which were applied to each study. The search wasconcluded in five stages\u2014article search, study selection, initial review, full text review, and analysis (figure 1).All the selected studies were then considered for detailed review.2.2. Study populationsTarget populations spanned 26 countries with nine studies that were global in scope. Figure 2 shows thenumber of case-studies focused on each country, including: Bangladesh (n= 8), the USA (n= 8), BurkinaFaso (n= 3), Fiji (n= 3), India (n= 3), Mexico (n= 3), Nigeria (n= 3), Ghana (n= 2), Pakistan (n= 2),Vietnam (n= 2), Brazil (n= 1), China (n= 1), Ecuador (n= 1), Honduras (n= 1), Indonesia (n= 1), theMaldives (n= 1), Mongolia (n= 1), Nepal (n= 1), the Philippines (n= 1), Solomon Islands (n= 1), SouthAfrica (n= 1), Syria (n= 1), Tanzania (n= 1), Tuvalu (n= 1), Uganda (n= 1), Vanuatu (n= 1). Selectedpapers studied precipitation changes (n= 22), temperature changes (n= 20), multiple climate hazards(n= 15), droughts (n= 9), floods (n= 5), storms (n= 4), erosion (n= 3), sea level rise (n= 3), wildfires(n= 3), salinization (n= 3), and explored other socio-economic factors related to climate change migrationand place attachment (n= 5).A majority of the reviewed studies examined migration in the recent decades (1960\u20132020), althoughthree studies did not state the study period. Participant populations ranged from 19 interviewees to 550 473households. Overall, 44 publications were quantitative, 12 were qualitative and two used a mixed-methodsapproach. Quantitative methods were used for analyzing the influence of climate and non-climate hazardson migration and forecasting future migration trends and included modeling and regression methods suchas agent-based model, Poisson regression model, ordinary least squares regression, multivariate logisticregression, survival prediction model, augmented gravity model, Poisson pseudo maximum likelihoodmodel, unobserved components model, grouped fixed-effects model, linear probability model, multinomiallogit model; and statistical analysis methods such as one-way test of variance (ANOVA), t-test, andresidential sorting model. Qualitative methods were used to provide in-depth insights into the humandimensions of climate migration and included focus groups, interviews, surveys, observations, archivalresearch, secondary sources, and popular media source analysis.3Environ.

ResultsWe review the key findings in the literature on the impact of climate hazards on migration, both within andacross international borders. Table 2 presents a summary of all reviewed papers, along with their findingsand the climate hazards studied.3.1. Multiple climate hazardsSeveral authors examined a combination of climate hazards in aggregate to assess the overall impact ofclimate hazards on migration. Climate hazards refer to environmental phenomena that have the potential toaffect societies and the human environment (FEMA 2023). While FEMA\u2019s National Risk Index enumerates 18types of such hazards, these studies focused primarily on floods, storms, droughts, landslides, andearthquakes as key drivers of migration (FEMA 2023).Research has revealed a complex relationship between climate hazards and migration patterns. Beine andParsons\u2019 (2017) studied the long-term impact of different climate hazards on migration worldwide andfound that, climate hazards including droughts, extreme temperatures, floods, storms led to an increase indomestic migration to urban areas but decreased the rates of international migration. Moreover,international migration has usually happened regionally to neighboring countries or those with priorcolonial links. They also found that income levels played a crucial role in the ability of residents affected byclimate hazards to migrate. Similarly, in Nepal, Gentle et al (2018) showed that climate change and hazardsthat increased weather variability pushed households to adapt through domestic and internationalmigration, but this process increased vulnerabilities among poor households. Still, their findings showedlittle evidence of a significant connection between climate hazards and international migration.Some findings suggest that migration decisions may be influenced by a broader range of climate hazardsthan previously considered, emphasizing that migration decisions are influenced not merely by theoccurrence of a disaster but by its severity. In the U.S., Shumway et al (2014) found that exposure to frequent,severe environmental hazards affected household decisions to migrate -especially in counties thatexperienced the greatest impacts from such hazards where economic conditions and declining populationsexacerbated the issue. Sheldon and Zhan (2022) found that climate hazards such as hurricanes, floods, andcoastal storms increased migration rates, but the likelihood of migration was highly dependent on incomelevels, as low-income households were more likely to remain in place, even with limited aid. Trinh et al(2021) also focus on the severity of climate disasters such as storms, floods, cyclones, landslides, and itsrelationship to household migration decisions in Vietnam from 2006 to 2008. They showed that both low-and high-income households were more likely to make migration decisions following major disasterscorrelated with the intensity of the climate event.In a study of the impact of various climate hazards including drought, flood, storm, wildfire, and extremetemperature in 90 countries, Bekaert et al (2021) found that climate hazards were likely to encourageindividuals to move locally, either within the country or within the same subcontinent. Groeschl andSteinwachs (2017) examined the impact of climate hazards such as storms, droughts, floods, andtemperature anomalies on international migration in 162 countries from 1980 to 2010 and found a linkbetween medium- to long-term international migration and climate hazards mainly in middle-incomecountries. Finally, a study by Kniveton et al (2012) in Burkina Faso revealed the nonlinear nature ofclimate-change-related migration, showing that the influence of climate change on migration appeared andstrengthened with rising population growth.Even non-sedentary populations might see shifts in migration patterns. Migratory herders, who maintaina unique and close connection to the land and often lead isolated lives, present a particularly complex case. Ina study of migratory pastoralism in Northern Pakistan, Joshi et al (2013) revealed that climate fluctuationsand changes forced herders to adapt by altering their migration patterns and diversifying their livelihoods.On a broader scale, the consequences of climate change require coordinated responses. Managedrelocation is one such response. In Fiji, studies by McMichael et al (2019) and Piggott-McKellar et al (2019)highlight how climate change hazards led to short-distance planned relocations of coastal villages with thesupport of the Fijian government, international donors, and other organizations. However, organizedrelocation was a rare response to climate hazards among the selected studies. In both the Solomon Islandsand the USA cases described by Albert et al (2017), migration occurred in response to rapid impacts ofclimate change, such as erosion and flooding, and was compounded by government inaction in organizingmanaged relocations.Some studies found that social connections, place attachment, and other socio-economic-cultural factorsalso affect decisions to stay in areas exposed to climate hazards. In a study of 200 households in Bangladesh,Mallick et al (2022) identified a strong unwillingness to migrate, despite the presence of slow-onset climate5Environ.

The reluctance to migratehappens due to land ownership, social connectedness, and household economic strength, among others.Further complicating the understanding of climate-induced migration is the work of Bohra-Mishra et al(2014) on Indonesian households. The authors found that episodic climate hazards such as floods andlandslides only promoted temporary and short-distance migration, and not permanent and long-distancemigration. Likewise, Gussmann and Hinkel (2021) provided different explanations when comparing twopost-tsunami relocations in the Maldives\u2014specifically a full relocation for Kalhaidhoo island and a partialrelocation for Mundoo island. They found that, despite the high coastal vulnerability due to sea-level rise,relocation outcomes depended on politics and power dynamics rather than adaptation considerations.Collectively, these studies highlight the differential impacts of various climate hazards on migrationwithin and across international borders. Both severity and frequency of climate hazards correlate with ahigher likelihood of migration. However, domestic and international migration do not uniformly respond toclimate hazards, as the reviewed studies generally emphasize that household income levels, place attachment,the societal and political conditions in the affected region, as well as a history of connections betweensending and receiving countries, significantly influence the climate hazard-migration relationship.3.2. Precipitation changesA clear link between long-term precipitation change and migration patterns has been well-documented, butthe influence of socio-economic factors cannot be discounted. For example, a case study in South Africa(Mastrorillo et al 2016) found that both positive and negative precipitation anomalies contributed to anincrease in migration, especially in districts characterized by higher employment in agriculture. Mastrorilloet al (2016) attribute this strong relationship to agriculture which acts as a transmission channel throughwhich rainfall anomalies affect migration. Black and low-income populations in the region, as well as thoseinvolved in agriculture, were found to be particularly vulnerable to precipitation anomalies, responding with10Environ. Res.: Climate 3 (2024) 042002 A Ivanova et alincreased migration. Mastrorillo et al (2016) attribute this relationship to a consequence of the apartheid;Black South Africans are largely located on some of the most marginal agricultural lands, which makes themmore vulnerable to climate change.Gray and Bilsborrow (2013) demonstrate that a long-term increase in precipitation led to higher rates ofdomestic migration in rural Ecuador. This is because above-average precipitation during the dry seasonenabled people to increase income through agriculture, facilitating their move to more prosperous areas.Additionally, Call and Gray\u2019s (2020) findings in Uganda revealed that long-term precipitation increasesprovided similar households with additional resources, allowing them to engage in migration for similarreasons\u2014i.e. better living conditions, education, and other opportunities. Research on rural households inIndia revealed that international migration, as well as rural to urban migration, was also associated withsignificant increase in precipitation due to the substantial impact of precipitation anomalies on agriculture,the main income source for these households. Cottier and Salehyan (2021), in their cross-country study,confirm that in agriculturally reliant countries disproportionately located in Sub-Saharan Africa (23countries), higher levels of precipitation led to increased migration to the European Union countries becausewetter-than-usual conditions enhanced the resources available to households. Similarly, in their long-termstudy on Indonesian households, Bohra-Mishra et al (2014) revealed that household annual migrationprobability increased with a rise in annual precipitation from 2.3 to 3.3 m across all provinces. Another studyby Nawrotzki et al (2016) in Burkina Faso and Senegal showed how the impact of precipitation differed evenwithin neighboring countries. They found that excessive precipitation resulted in international migration,but this trend was observed to be stronger in Senegal due to a high reliance of the most impactedcommunities in Senegal on agriculture. In contrast to these studies, Delazeri et al (2022) study in theNortheast region of Brazil showed that an increase in days with less than 1 mm of precipitation led to adecrease in rural-to-urban migration. This decrease was observed in areas with both the lowest and highestlevels of agricultural income. In other words, regardless of the income level, low levels of precipitationlimited rural-to-urban migration.However, the relationship between increased precipitation and migration is not necessarily direct andlinear. Cattaneo and Massetti (2015) identified a significant U-shaped relationship between wet-seasonprecipitation and migration decisions among agricultural households in Nigeria and Ghana, where migrationpropensity was highest at 125 mm/month of precipitation during the wet season for farming households andturned negative when precipitation exceeded 225 mm/month. Call et al (2017) showed that migrationdecreased during periods of extreme precipitation in Bangladesh. Nonetheless, it consistently increasedduring periods of typical precipitation conditions. They attribute these findings to the fact that agriculturallydependent households experienced crop loss due to riverine flooding during increased precipitationresulting in insufficient resources to migrate. Beine and Parsons\u2019 (2017) cross-country study demonstratedthat short-term precipitation changes decreased international migration from middle-income countries butdid not influence migration from poorer countries, where financial barriers impacted migration. Janes\u2019(2010) study, in Mongolia\u2019s rural counties, focused on changes in precipitation patterns, which, whencoupled with the lack of rural development, amplified livelihood insecurity that increased urban migration.Other socio-economic factors, such as social capital-mediated adaptation and migration patterns, werefound to influence the relationship between precipitation and migration. Leyk et al (2017) found thatprecipitation deficits strongly influenced migration decisions in Mexico\u2014more so for domestic migrationthan international migration. However, the stronger impact of precipitation changes on domestic migration,they argue, could be due to factors such as strict border laws with the U.S. or the high cost of internationalmigration. Another study in rural Mexico, by Nawrotzki et al (2015), suggests that while initial waves ofmigration were influenced by precipitation, later waves were less climate-sensitive due to established socialnetworks at the destination. Moreover, international migration has usually been directed regionally toneighboring countries or those with prior colonial links (Beine and Parsons 2017). These relationships varyconsiderably across regions and appear to be nonlinear. For example, Thiede et al (2016) studied the impactof climate variability on migration in eight South American countries. They found varying responses tonegative, short-term changes in precipitation. For example, such changes resulted in a\u223c68% increase ininter-province migration odds in Colombia, but only a 7.0% increase in Chile.However, not every study reviewed established a link between precipitation and migration. For example,Martinez-Zarzoso\u2019s (2020) research on migration flows did not attribute a significant association betweenthe population-weighted local precipitation and migration across 142 countries with considerableheterogeneity between countries. Similarly, Abu et al (2014) discovered that despite the obvious recognitionof precipitation changes as a serious stressor by communities of Bouko and Bofie-Banda in Ghana, thesechanges did not directly explain their migration intentions. Mueller et al (2014) contributed to this complexnarrative by demonstrating that in Pakistan, excessive precipitation did not have a significant impact onmigration because rainfall did not necessarily lead to a negative income shock for households. While Gray11Environ. Res.: Climate 3 (2024) 042002 A Ivanova et alet al (2020) discovered that in China, before the year 2000, short-term decreases in precipitation initially ledto an increase in temporary migration; this trend gradually reversed over time likely due to enhancedadaptation capacities of rural households such as crop adaptation and livelihood diversification. Feng et al(2012) looked at climate-driven changes in crop yields and migration in the US and revealed that the impactsof precipitation changes on migration are relatively small as migration rates never exceeded 2%. Similarresults were identified in agricultural households in India (Dallmann and Millock 2017) and Tanzania(Chegere and Mrosso 2022).The reviewed studies on precipitation revealed contrasting migration responses to precipitation changesacross different regions. Additionally, the duration of precipitation changes, particularly long-term changes,correlates with increases in migration. Many studies also emphasized the nonlinearity ofprecipitation-migration relationships, which evidence suggests is mediated and sometimes mitigated bysocio-economic factors.3.3. FloodsAs is the case with precipitation, we found mixed evidence of the influence of flooding on migrationdecisions. Four studies emphasized the role of flooding in migration decisions (Berlemann and Tran 2020,Bekaert et al 2021, Ekoh et al 2022). However, two earlier studies indicated that floods were not as importantin explaining migration (Call et al 2017, Dallmann and Millock 2017).In Vietnam, Berlemann and Tran (2020) found that communities with increasing severity or frequency offlooding experienced significantly increased domestic migration from the affected region. Furthermore, theyfound that communities perceiving that flooding events have become more severe over the last decadeshowed higher rates of migration. Ekoh et al (2022) found a positive correlation between flood riskperceptions and migration intentions in Lagos, Nigeria. More broadly, Bekaert et al (2021) found asignificant connection between floods and international migration across 90 countries in Africa, LatinAmerica and the Caribbean, Asia, North America, Europe, and Oceania. Oyekale (2013) found that lack ofalternative occupation increased vulnerability risks when flooding occurs; this means that individuals whoonly have one type of job or who lack any job skills are especially vulnerable to the effects climate change.However, Call et al (2017) in a similar study in Bangladesh suggested that the relationships betweenflooding and migration were inconsistent. They found that migration initially decreased following flooding,then, later, returned to normal levels due to food insecurity caused by sudden floods. Dallmann andMillock\u2019s (2017) study on precipitation anomalies in India showed that floods had low importance inexplaining long-term domestic migration.The existing body of research presents mixed evidence on the impact of floods on migration. While halfof the studies emphasizes the significant connection, the other half indicates that this relationship is neitherconsistent nor significant. Once again, it is likely that socio-economic considerations mediate or mitigate theeffects presented by climate pressures.3.4. DroughtsThe importance of drought studies is notable in research examining the effects of climate change onmigration. Dallmann and Millock (2017) demonstrated that droughts significantly influenced domesticmigration in India. For every month of drought experienced in an origin state during five years, there was a1.5% average increase in the migration rate between different states within India nationally and 1.7% inagricultural areas. In Syria, Ash and Obradovich (2020) primarily focused on political conflicts. However,they provided evidence suggesting that droughts spurred domestic migration from the affected regions, butthey did not analyze the extent to which out-migration contributed to the observed population change.McMichael et al (2023) examined three case studies and found that irregular rainfall and extreme heattriggered droughts in Burkina Faso, leading to food insecurity and the seasonal migration of men, while theirwives and children remained behind. Similarly, in Bangladesh, droughts reduced agricultural employmentopportunities, forcing adults to move to urban centers, increasing their own vulnerability and that of theirfamily members who remained behind (McMichael et al 2023). Meanwhile, in Vietnam, Berlemann and Tran(2020) observed that recent droughts typically resulted in temporary domestic migration, while severe,recurring droughts led to permanent migration from the affected areas. In rural Ecuador, Gray andBilsborrow (2013) observed that exposure to droughts led to an increase in international migration but adecrease in domestic migration. They explained that domestic migrants typically came from agriculturalhouseholds. The scarcity of resources, intensified by droughts that negatively impacted their primary sourceof income\u2014agriculture\u2014influenced these migration patterns.Two studies in Mexico and Senegal found contrasting results of the droughts on international migration.Hunter et al (2013) suggested that in Mexico, the recentness of a drought, coupled with household migrationhistory and a broad social network, collectively determined their migration ability. In other words,12Environ. Res.: Climate 3 (2024) 042002 A Ivanova et alhouseholds that were recently affected by drought and had strong social networks and a history of migrationwere more likely to migrate internationally to the US. However, Nawrotzki et al (2016) showed that droughtsled to a decrease in international migration from Senegal, especially in areas with acute undernutrition. Thissuggests that as with precipitation and floods, international migration due to drought has a cost that must beovercome.Bekaert et al (2021) conducted an expansive study on migration intentions via Gallup World Polls surveyacross 90 countries, which indicated that droughts increased domestic migration intentions. Overall, theirfindings emphasized that the strongest drought-related intentions to migrate outside the country of originwere seen in low- and middle-income countries in Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean, while inhigher income regions such intentions were largely limited to domestic migration. However, Cottier andSalehyan (2021) found little evidence that droughts increased migration flows to the European Union (EU)from non-EU countries. Particularly, they showed that in agriculturally dependent countries, droughts wereassociated with an immediate decrease of out-migration due to decreased household income.To summarize, droughts have a significant relationship with migration. However, the effect of droughtson migration is mediated and mitigated by socio-economic factors such as food insecurity, agriculturalemployment, social networks, income levels, and household migration history.3.5. Tropical stormsThere is evidence that climate change increases both the frequency and severity of tropical storms (IPCC2023a). Current research on the impact of tropical storms on migration does not specifically address theimpact of climate change beyond considering how the frequency and intensity of events might influencemigration. We reviewed four current, but limited studies in nascent literature.Mahajan and Yang\u2019s (2020) study on the impact of hurricanes on international migration to the UnitedStates from 1980 to 2004 showed that hurricanes increased migration on average, especially where themigration pattern to the U.S. was already established. Griffith\u2019s (2020) qualitative research on migration inPuerto Rico and Honduras as a result of hurricanes identified such migration as a strategy to enhancelivelihood and reduce risk.In a more localized context, a study by Sastry and Gregory (2014) on the migration patterns of NewOrleans residents post-Hurricane Katrina showed that while hurricanes can prompt migration, their effectsvary among individuals. Specifically, they found that 53% of those affected did not permanently migratefrom New Orleans, while those who did typically moved elsewhere within Louisiana or to neighboring Texas.Research on typhoons in Vietnam by Berlemann and Tran (2020) focused exclusively on temporaryinternal migration using household panel data compared to storm data provided by the National Oceanicand Atmospheric Administration. While they did not study permanent internal migration, they found thattropical storms acted as a \u2018push\u2019 increasing the likelihood of temporary migration within a household as wellas increasing the number of household members who migrate temporarily. However, the authors cautionthat temporary migration is already a trending strategy for enhancing livelihood but avoiding the high cost ofpermanent urban migration in Vietnam.Generally, there is some evidence for the impact of storm activity on temporary migration, but thestrength of the effect varies by region and community. However, there is a lack of evidence regarding theimpact of tropical storms on permanent migration. One common pattern observed in these studies is thesignificant impact of historical migration patterns and existing migrant populations in the targeted areas,which compel increased migration after hurricanes.3.6. TemperatureAmong all the studies in this review that examined the relationship between temperature change andmigration, four were cross-country analyses. Thiede et al (2016) discovered that monthly short-termtemperature increases impacted inter-provincial migration in eight South American countries. Moreglobally, temperature increases have been shown to boost out-migration among agricultural workers (Cottierand Salehyan 2021) and low-skilled laborers (Helbling and Meierrieks 2021) mostly from warmer countriesalready experiencing high baseline levels of heat stress and countries highly dependent on agriculture. Inparticular, Martinez-Zarzoso (2020) found that a gradual increase in temperature caused more people tomigrate internationally. For every 1% increase in local temperature, migration rates rose by 0.5% from 142countries to 19 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development countries.In Pakistan, Mueller et al (2014) captured the strong positive relationship between high temperatures andmigration due to the financial hardships of farming under increasingly hot temperatures. Their study alsodistinguished gender-specific migration trends, particularly that men tended to migrate long-term, whilewomen chose short-term migration. Additionally, the study also showed that poorer households were morelikely to migrate compared to wealthier ones. Similar results were identified by case studies in Indonesia13Environ. Res.: Climate 3 (2024) 042002 A Ivanova et al(Bohra-Mishra et al 2014), South Africa (Mastrorillo et al 2016), and Northeastern Brazil (Delazeri et al2022). Janes\u2019 (2010) qualitative study of Mongolian pastoral communities revealed that climate change, interms of temperature extremes in rural areas of Mongolia, together with the lack of rural development,intensified livelihood insecurity and increased urban migration. Temperature increases were also correlatedwith increases in rural to urban migration in studies conducted in rural India (Sedova and Kalkuhl 2020)and Uganda (Call and Gray 2020).The impact of rising temperatures on migration decisions is not exclusive to poorer households. Forexample, Fan et al (2016) looked at how extreme weather affected household location preferences across theUnited States and found a link between brain-drain and extreme temperatures. In other words, highlyqualified workers migrated away from regions affected by extreme temperature increases.As with other climate related factors, the relationship between temperature increases andmigration\u2014especially international migration\u2014is mediated and mitigated by socio-economic factors.Sedova and Kalkuhl (2020) showed that rural-rural and international migration decreased in areasexperiencing temperature extremes, despite an increase in rural-urban migration. This could be due togeographically correlated weather shocks in nearby rural areas and financial constraints affectinginternational migration especially since climate migrants are likely to come from households stronglydependent on agricultural production or low-skill laboring work. Similar findings were discovered inBurkina Faso (Nawrotzki et al 2016). In rural Mexico, Nawrotzki et al (2015) observed that the probability ofinternational migration increased the most with rising temperatures for households that have access tocommunity migrant networks. Beine and Parsons (2017) in their cross-country study, found short-termtemperature changes decreased international migration from middle-income countries but had no effect onmigration from poorer countries, suggesting income levels and migration costs remain relevant.The association between temperature increase or decrease and migration is not always straightforward.For example, Cattaneo and Massetti (2015) showed a U-shaped relationship between migration propensityand temperature during the dry season among farming households in Nigeria and Ghana becausetemperature anomalies can impact the profitability of agriculture and migration requires resources. Similarresults were identified by Cai et al (2016). In the U.S., Feng et al (2012) studied the connection betweenclimate-driven changes in crop yields and migration and revealed that the agricultural-related migration wasdriven by temperature. This relationship is nonlinear because temperature impacts on crop yields are alsononlinear. Their findings showed that a 1% decrease in yields of corn and soybeans in the rural U.S. countiesof the Corn Belt led to a 0.17% net reduction of the population through migration. However, this responsewas not observed in eastern counties outside the Corn Belt. Gray et al (2020) discovered that in China,short-term temperature anomalies, like precipitation changes (discussed earlier), increased permanentmigration prior to the year 2000, and then after 2000 a short-term increase in temperature resulted in adecrease in permanent migration. As with precipitation changes, they attributed this shift to the changingsocial and economic context. Finally, research conducted by Chegere and Mrosso (2022) on agriculturalhouseholds in Tanzania explained that temperature deviations may not be the push factor driving temporarymigration in agricultural households. Instead, the authors attributed temporary migration to incomediversification when no other adaptation alternatives were available.Reviewed studies on temperature as a driver of climate migration had a consensus about the significanceof this relationship; however, the complexity of the relationship varies across regions. This complexity isshaped by socio-economic factors such as gender, social ties, educational or skill levels, the agriculturaldependency of households, and aspects of agriculture.3.7. ErosionErosion, marked by the loss of land, poses significant challenges worldwide, particularly in areas housingaffected coastal and riverine communities. Unlike other disasters, existing literature on erosion indicates aconsistently positive connection between erosion and migration. However, this research is very limited.Moreover, how the previously discussed factors are linked to erosion is another question that should bepursued.Bernzen et al (2019) found that the likelihood of migration in Bangladesh increased with the loss ofarable land. Bohra-Mishra et al (2014) found that for every 1% rise in deaths and houses lost to landslides inIndonesia, the probability of households migrating each year increased by 0.0006% and 0.0004%,respectively. Alam et al (2020) in Bangladesh adopted a slightly different approach, suggesting that migrationwas a non-direct consequence of riverbank erosion coupled with associated climatic challenges. Theyattributed this to the the reduced access to essentials such as food, water, electricity, education, healthcare,and jobs followed by the loss of land. They noted that migration due to erosion took a variety of forms,including both permanent and temporary, within and outside of the migrants\u2019 originating communities.14Environ. Res.: Climate 3 (2024) 042002 A Ivanova et al3.8. Sea level riseThree studies identified sea level rise as one of the causes of migration (Hauer 2017, Jamero et al 2017,Adams and Kay 2019). In Bangladesh, Adams and Kay (2019) showed that sea level rise did not directlyimpact migration; downstream hazards from sea-level rise such as increases in sunny day flooding or stormsurge flooding drove climate migration. However, this type of migration depends on the heterogeneity of theexposed population. Similarly, Hauer\u2019s (2017) analysis of the likely migration destinations of the USpopulation revealed that a 1.8 m sea level rise would cause net migration in every state, affecting 86% of USCore Based Statistical Areas and 56% of US counties. Conversely, research by Jamero et al (2017) in thePhilippines presented different evidence. Their study showed that island residents preferred on-islandadaptive strategies over relocation to the mainland, even in the face of rising sea levels.Sea-level rise is widely recognized as the main consequence of climate change (Eyring et al 2021).However, due to its gradual effect, the impact of sea-level rise on migration cannot be comprehendedimmediately. Thus, it is increased exposure to coastal hazards that drives migration instead. Anotherphenomenon, not exclusive to sea-level rise but observed across various indicators of climate change isnon-migration. In some cases, social capital and a sense of identity, often reflected in the determination tosecure traditional livelihoods, strengthened the community\u2019s desire to remain in affected areas instead ofmigrating in the Philippines (Jamero et al 2017).3.9. WildfiresThe literature on the subject of wildfires and migration is limited and mixed. Nawrotzki et al (2014)conducted a survey of residents in the wildland-urban interface of Boulder and Larimer counties inColorado, two months after the Fourmile Canyon fire in 2010. Out of 428 respondents, only 4% expressedany intention to relocate due to the risk of future wildfires; the majority of them planned to move withinclose proximity to maintain social bonds. In Ghana, Abu et al (2014) observed that households affected bybushfires were more likely to migrate to other places in search of employment opportunities. They link thispattern to the fact that bushfires often resulted from irregular rainfall and droughts and potential impact oncrop yields. These combined climate and socio-economic factors contributed to migration. In contrast, in across- country analysis, Bekaert et al (2021) observed a negative significant effect of wildfires on domesticmigration across 90 countries in Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, Asia, North America, Europe, andOceania.While these studies do not present uniform conclusion, they suggest that the impact of wildfires onmigration depends on socio-economic factors and possibly the strength of existing social ties. There is also astronger migration trend from regions where wildfires occur alongside other climate hazards.3.10. SalinizationAccording to Chen and Mueller\u2019s (2018) study of 550 473 Bangladeshi households, mild salinity contributesto decisions to migrate, while extreme salinity had a direct negative impact on international migration.However, Bernzen et al (2019) learned that salinization issues had a negligible positive and non-significantassociation with migration in Bangladesh. In neighboring India, a study by Sengupta and Samanta (2022) inGobardhanpur village found that people did not migrate despite the salinization of the land. The high soilsalinity only forced them to adjust and shift from agriculture to fishing (Sengupta and Samanta 2022).3.11. Place attachmentResearchers have examined the relationship between place attachment, defined as a unique emotional andcultural connection that an individual develops with a place (Stedman 2003), and the decision to migrate inthe face of climate change across a variety of geographical and cultural settings. Non-migration andadaptation in place, due to place attachment, are issues that are often addressed in this literature. Five studiesshowed that a strong place attachment makes a person reluctant to migrate (Penning-Rowsell et al 2013,Marino and Lazrus 2015, Perumal 2018, Adams and Kay 2019, Sengupta and Samanta 2022).Marino and Lazrus\u2019 (2015) comparative study offers insights into the migration responses to climatehazards in Shishmaref, Alaska, and Nanumea, Tuvalu, where they are not unidirectional, but have a cyclicalcharacter and always occurred between urban and rural areas, either on an annual basis or throughout alifetime. They attribute this to a strong attachment to place and the need of these communities to engage intraditional rural practices such as subsistence harvesting, hunting, local celebrations, and food trading.Similarly, Sengupta and Samanta\u2019s (2022) research in the Indian village of Gobardhanpur provided evidencethat place attachment can be relatively more influential than economic or climate factors in migrationdecisions. These studies are consistent with earlier findings by Penning-Rowsell et al (2013), who, throughfocus group research in 10 Bangladeshi villages, observed that migration was often seen as the last option forthe affected population; when Bangladeshi villagers migrate, it was regionally, among a small group of15Environ. Res.: Climate 3 (2024) 042002 A Ivanova et alpeople, and temporary. This emotional resistance to migration was also observed in the Pacific Islandcommunity of Vanuatu, where Perumal (2018) demonstrated how a strong attachment to place made theVanuatu community resilient to migration because they had built resilience through adaptation,preparedness, and response resources. Complementing these studies, Adams and Kay\u2019s (2019) research with1500 households in coastal Bangladesh explored the role of place attachment and rootedness in migrationdecisions. They found that despite having low adaptive capacity, coastal communities in Bangladesh wereresistant to relocating due to strong emotional and social ties to their places of origin.Across many geographic and cultural environments, the common factor is the significant influence ofplace attachment. The emotional connection between the place affected by climate hazards and theindividual sometimes outweighs economic and environmental pressures. Even when migration occurs, ittends to occur temporarily and regionally.4. DiscussionIn this article, we focused on climate hazards and human migration. However, we recognize, drawing on thepreviously discussed mobility justice scholarship, that the decision to migrate is as much about climatechange as it is about existing societal inequities and other stressors, such as unequal land and capital access,gender inequality, colonialism, economic disparities, and conflicts. Our position here is that neither can besafely ignored in addressing issues associated with climate-based migration. We view this review as the firststep in the process of reconciling such diverse causes and contributors. Several scholars view climate changein terms of its injustice\u2014those that have contributed the least to causing climate change are being impactedmost severely. As such, we must understand the drivers of such inequity to include migration issues in orderto better address said injustice.In the studies that we analyzed, temperature changes and droughts had the most evidence for drivingmigration. An increase in temperature leads to migration, especially in agriculturally dependent regions.Temperature changes resulted in increased international migration, as well as rural-urban domesticmigration. Droughts had strong relationships with migration, but the direction of this response varies byregion. For example, in rural Ecuador, droughts increased international migration, but in Senegal, they led toa decrease in migration. Reviewed studies revealed a trend that multiple climate hazards collectively tendedto increase domestic migration toward urban areas.In agriculturally reliant regions, changes in precipitation had a direct impact on domestic migration. Inthe United States, Bangladesh, Vietnam, and Burkina Faso, severe and frequent climate hazards such asdroughts and floods had a significant effect on domestic migration. Climate hazards tend to make peoplemore likely to move domestically rather than internationally; however, it is worth noting that affectedpopulations may not be able to migrate internationally due to socio-economic or political constraints such aslimited resources or strict border control (Leyk et al 2017). International migration often happens toneighboring countries or those with previous colonial links or a history of migration. This pattern suggeststhat migrants tend to move to places with closer cultural backgrounds or social ties.Many studies indicate that climate hazards like droughts, floods, and short-term temperature changessignificantly affect agriculture, which is the main source of income in agriculturally reliant regions. Thesehazards often lead to a decline in the overall profitability of agriculture and the loss of jobs, resulting ininsufficient resources for migration. Conversely, conditions such as wetter-than-usual during the dry seasoncan enhance the resources available to households, facilitating an increase in migration. Other climatehazards, including landslides, floods, and storms result in loss of infrastructure of the affected communities,which often necessitate migration.The reviewed literature highlights how socio-economic, political, and cultural factors, including socialconnections at the planned destination, income levels, gender, educational or skill levels, employment type,history of household migration, or political situation (e.g. strict border laws, colonial history, forced orarranged displacement) influence migration patterns. Additionally, research has also emphasized theimportance of place attachment, indicating that people often prefer not to migrate unless they areexperiencing severe stress. Even in such cases, the tendency appears to be to adapt in place rather thanrelocate. Environmental degradation will have a limited impact on the migration patterns of populationswith higher education levels, wealth, and social connectivity, unlike landless households and those withyounger members and few dependents (McLeman and Smit 2004). Impoverished communities may not beable to financially support their plans to migrate and may elect local opportunities for income diversification.This might suggest that strengthening local opportunities for livelihood diversification could reduce the needfor migration. However, it is crucial to understand how climate change impacts regional power dynamics togenerate usable knowledge, which we encourage other scholars to pursue. Finally, the lack of consistency infindings of the reviewed studies are likely associated with differences in research methodologies, diverse16Environ. Res.: Climate 3 (2024) 042002 A Ivanova et alstudy regions, differing time frames, as well as the complexity of the relationships between climate hazardsand migration.Our review revealed a few gaps in the existing research on climate migration. First, such climate changeindicators as tropical storms, salinization, wildfires, and erosion have received relatively limited attention inthe research on climate migration. We encourage researchers to explore these relationships further. Second,current research has paid a lot of attention to Bangladesh, the USA, Burkina Faso, Fiji, India, Mexico, andNigeria, while other countries have received less attention, except in a few cross-country studies. There is aneed for case studies specifically focusing on countries in Central and Western Asia, Africa, Europe, andSouth America. Given the expected increase in migration globally due to climate hazards, there is a need tounderstand the impacts of climate change across all regions of the world. Third, the existing research isleaning towards quantitative or econometric studies, which is a significant limitation, as studies that neglectqualitative methods risk reporting a simplistic picture on climate migration. Future research can integratedifferent methodologies, including quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods, to strengthen the relevanceof findings by incorporating more nuanced perspectives and offer more actionable insights. Qualitativemethods will have a particular significance when examining the role of socio-economic factors in migration.Inclusion of methodologies such as participatory action research is critical for addressing power inequalitiesand co-creating solutions that work for communities Fourth, despite including \u2018health\u2019 as a search term, wedid not find any research specifically addressing healthcare access or physical or mental health impactsrelated to migration. Migrants may face new health risks related to climate change in receiving countries,especially when housing insecurity that often accompanies migration where they are more exposed toclimate and climate-related hazards; knowledge of migrants\u2019 health needs could assist health systems inpreparing to provide appropriate health services (Schwerdtle et al 2018).Fifth, while many of the studies discussed here assume migration as a \u2018rational\u2019 adaptation response, weargue that it is important for critical migration and climate change studies to question this. Adaptationstudies have little to offer in terms of conceptualizing the different forms of power that determine theprocesses through which various social groups are rendered secure or vulnerable to environmental change,thus falling short of historically and analytically grounded analyses that situate socio-ecological relations thatproduce social vulnerability and environmental fragility (Taylor 2014). This is especially true for agrarianenvironments (Agrawal and Sivaramakrishnan 2000), where adaptation studies are bereft of attention to thehistorical roots of vulnerability faced by marginal groups. In the semi-arid Indian Deccan, for example, theparadox of climate change adaptation is that agriculture dotted by small farms is already in crisis because oftightening constraints on profitability, increasing indebtedness, and limitations on means of socialreproduction. Adaptation must connect the regional/micro, or how vulnerability manifests locally, with thesystemic/macro, or the historically constituted power and privilege relations; the consequence of not doingso is to inadvertently render adaptation as a depoliticized concept used to explain how vulnerablecommunities must be protected from climate hazards, but incapable of explaining contentious and complexsocio-ecological relations (Taylor 2014).A major limitation of this review involves the search strategy. Although we did not include secondaryliterature, the widening of the study type would enhance this analysis. Additionally, some of the previousgaps we identified in the existing research might be a consequence of the scarcity of English-languageresearch. We intentionally excluded non-English literature from our review which synchronically limited ourfindings. Future review studies could benefit from exploring research in other languages. This is important asevidence of migration might be documented in other languages since much of the migration is anticipated orthought to occur from and within countries where English might not be the primary language. Weacknowledge that our decision to exclude non-English literature from the review inadvertently privilegespredominantly Western scholarship on the topic, potentially providing a limited perspective on the climatemigration literature. However, we tried to address this limitation in two ways. First, we included studies bythe authors affiliated with the research institutions from the affected regions (many in the Global South).Second, we did not entirely focus on top-down quantitative research, but also included qualitative studiesthat highlight the perspectives of populations living in the affected areas, following Piguet et al (2018).Another limitation of our review is that we coded manually to summarize and categorize the articles. Thisapproach limited the overall number of research articles we could review. Future research can use theunsupervised machine learning text mining method recommended by Zander et al (2023), which will makethe coding process more efficient and could mitigate potential biases.Our research is chiefly focused on climate-sensitive sending areas and not the destination areas wheremigrants tend to land, which does not align with Boas et al (2019). However, the geographically diversereviewed studies in this research that specifically use quantitative modeling methods attend to hostdestinations (Mahajan and Yang 2020, Bekaert et al 2021, Cottier and Salehyan 2021). Additionally, ourin-depth analysis of each selected study in every climate hazard category section with comprehensive17Environ. Res.: Climate 3 (2024) 042002 A Ivanova et alexplanation of the contexts helped highlight the directions of climate mobility. Furthermore, the lack ofunified terminology for the same climate hazards in climate migration research leads to ambiguity. Finally,many countries have recently experienced acute climate disasters coinciding with conflicts, which makes ithard to distinguish the impact of climate change from that of conflict on migration.Data availability statementAll data that support the findings of this study are included within the article (and any supplementaryinformation files).AcknowledgmentsThis article represents an expanded version of research initially undertaken as part of the Climate BasedHuman Migration Project (CHMP) for which the authors gratefully acknowledge seed funding from theOffice of Research at Washington State University.

Economists and climate scientists have made use \nof the latest model-based projections of changes in temperature and precipitation produced by a suite of \ngeneral circulation models (GCM) for this purpose.  The results of these studies often range from large \nnegative impacts to relatively modest impacts when aggregated at a global scale (e.g., Nordhaus, 2006; \nTol, 2002; Nordhaus and Boyer, 2000).   \nInterestingly, economists and others have been concerned with the link between climate and economic \nwell being well before the recent attention spawned by climate change.   In the late 19\nth century, the \nBritish government charged successive scientists in India with predicting the quality of monsoon rains in \nan attempt to mitigate the devastating effects of drought on the subcontinent.  One of these scientists, Sir \nGilbert Walker, pioneered the use of correlation coefficients and used them to establish the Southern \nOscillation Index (SOI), a pressure differential between Darwin, Australia and Tahiti that still serves as an \nindicator of the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO).   \nIn this study, the focus of investigation is the effect of climate variability on human welfare.  From an \nepisodic standpoint, the direct effects of a drought on a region or of a flood on a river basin are fairly \nobvious.  These direct effects can be, and often are, quantified in terms of the damage they cause.   \nHowever, do these effects accumulate and contribute to a general reduction of welfare or a drag on \neconomic growth?  Perhaps surprisingly, previous studies do not provide a convincing answer to this \nquestion.   \nCurrent understanding of the earth\u2019s climate make clear that different regions of the world differ in terms \nof their mean climate conditions, e.g., the average temperature and precipitation, but also in the variability \nof the climate.  Parts of the world are more prone to large swings in the year to year amount of rainfall \u00a0 3\nthey receive, or the average temperature that occurs.  As a result, there are places that have higher and in \nsome cases much higher exogenous exposure to droughts and floods.   \nThis result, that parts of the world experience differential exposure to climate variability and damage- \ncausing climate extremes, has important implications for our understanding of how climate affects human \nwelfare and economic growth.  If climate variability was distributed equally throughout the world, then \none could surmise that evidence of climate effects on welfare or economic growth would be due to \nendogenous factors within the states where measured, such as the quality of the institutions or the \ninfrastructure.  One may then assume that the key climate differences between countries would be limited \nto their mean conditions, i.e., some places are hotter or dryer than others.  When it is clear that climate \nvariability is not equally distributed but in fact is higher in some regions than in others, then one might \nsurmise that this greater degree of variability could cause conditions that were disadvantageous to human \nwelfare and economic growth.  In fact, one could conceive of a state where the effects of repeated \ndroughts or floods are so deleterious that it hinders the ability of that state to make the investments \nnecessary to mitigate the effects of climate variability, investments such as infrastructure and weather \nobservation and forecast systems, and so the effect of climate variability relative to its effect in other \nstates is amplified by the variability itself.   \nIn this analysis we attempt to assess whether climate variability is an impediment to economic growth and \na contributor to poverty levels in countries where exposure to variability is high.  The analysis makes use \nof a new rainfall statistic that captures climate extremes in rainfall and their spatial extent.   The \neconometric model is applied to national level growth and poverty statistics representing most countries \nof the world.  It builds on a previous study using a similar approach that identified drought as a significant \nand negative factor influencing poverty levels and GDP growth in Sub-Saharan Africa (Brown et al., \n2010).  The results of this study will have significant implications for evaluating the costs of climate \nchange and the continuing dialogue on the best means for adapting to climate change.  Typically, climate \nchange impact analyses have focused on changes in mean conditions, effectively ignoring the damages or \u00a0 4\nbenefits that might be associated with changes in variability.  Furthermore, adaptation planning often \nproceeds without an understanding of the climate effects that have the strongest impact on society.  As a \nresult, temperature is usually employed as the lone predictive variable.  Through this analysis we provide \nsome evidence that climate variability, and particularly extremes of precipitation, are the factors that \nshould be foremost in adaptation planning.  \nReview of the Influence of Climate on Economic Development \nThe reasoning that underpins the hypothesis that climate has had negative effects on economic growth \nderives from the ample evidence of direct negative impacts of climate extremes on society locally.  In the \nUnited States, drought has been estimated to be the most costly form of natural disaster, with an annual \naverage cost of $6 \u2013 8 billion (FEMA, 1995).  The recent drought gripping California may cost as much \nas $2 billion this year to that state alone (McKinley, 2009).  Drought is also the leading single cause of \ndeaths due to natural disasters, representing 50% of the global total (World Bank, 2005).  The devastating \nimpacts of drought have caused massive famines, such as in the 1980s in Ethiopia and 19\nth century India, \nand  led to mass migration as in the Dust Bowl of the 1930s in the U.S. and repeatedly in Northeast \nBrazil, and possibly contributed to conflict in the Sudan recently.  Floods affect societies in different ways \nand at different scales of time and space, but with similar devastation.  Floods destroy homes and \ninfrastructure, the \u201cphysical and social capital of society\u201d (Dasgupta, 2007) and are frequently followed \nby disease.  In China, floods on the Yangtze River in the early 20\nth century repeatedly killed hundreds of \nthousands, and flood damages in 1998 were estimated at $30 billion.   Damages due to flooding in 1998 \non the Ganges and Brahmaputra in India, Bangladesh and Nepal were estimated at $5 billion.   \nCountry-level studies provide evidence that the direct damages due to climate variability can have a \nsignificant effect on national economies.  An investigation of drought and flood impacts on Ethiopia \nusing an economy-wide model found that their effects reduced economic growth by greater than a third \n(Grey and Sadoff, 2006).  A study of Kenya found that the variability effects due to ENSO between 1997 \u00a0 5\nand 2000 resulted in losses that ranged from 10 \u2013 16% of GDP as a result of the associated floods and \ndroughts (World Bank, 2004).    \nThe direct effects of climate events on a society or a region are straightforward to quantify.  There is also \nevidence of indirect effects on societies due to repeated exposure to climate variability.  The most \nrelevant to this analysis is evidence that repeated exposure to climate extremes leads to risk aversion and \na counterproductive reduction in investment, leading to a reinforcing negative wealth cycle or \u201cpoverty \ntrap\u201d  (Dercon, 1996; Barrett and Swallow, 2006).  This evidence is largely derived from information \ngathered at the household and village level.  For example, Rosenzweig and Binswanger (1993) studied \nhousehold wealth, investment choices and rainfall for 6 villages in India and found that risk aversion due \nto rainfall variability negatively influenced choices, leading to less profitable investments.  Farmers are \nless likely to make investments in fertilizers or high value crops if there\u2019s a significant probability that the \ninvestment will be lost due to insufficient rainfall or a flood.  As a result, there are major opportunity \ncosts imposed by climate variability that impedes their ability to accumulate savings that might see them \nthrough the next shock.  They remain trapped in a low level subsistence equilibrium.   Dercon (2001) \nidentified rainfall shocks (droughts) as the primary reason that households fell into poverty in a study of 6 \nEthiopian villages.  Income growth was reduced by up to 20% relative to growth without the rainfall \nvariability.  The level of wealth was found to play an important role in the climate effect.    In a study of \nsix villages in Burkina Faso, the average farmer experienced food shortfalls in one out of five years due to \nincome variability associated with rainfall, while the poorest farmers (bottom quartile in land holdings) \nexperienced shortfalls in four out of five years, and the top quartile had shortfalls in only one of ten years \n(Carter, 1997).  It was estimated that poor farmers forego about 18% of their income to buffer against \nclimate risks, while the better off farmers forego only 0.4% of income buffer risk (Zimmerman and \nCarter, 2003). \nDo the direct and indirect effects of climate variability aggregate to a detectable signal that influences \neconomic growth at the scale of national economies?  Few studies address this question directly.  Studies \u00a0 6\nthat have attempted to quantify the effect of climate on economic growth have almost entirely focused on \nchanges in mean climate conditions (e.g., Nordhaus, 2006; Tol, 2002; Nordhaus and Boyer, 2000).  As \nNordhaus describes \u201c \u2026 current theories and empirical studies of economic growth give short thrift to \nclimate as the basis for differences in the wealth of nations.\u201d   Other studies, while acknowledging the \npotential impact of climate and variability, have classified it as a subcomponent of \u201cgeography\u201d (Sachs, \n2001).  Typically approached using a cross-country analysis method, the results were generally unable to \nspecify significant geography effects that could be distinguished from other institutional factors (Rodrik \net al., 2004; Sachs, 2003).    \nA small number of studies have begun to highlight the importance of year to year variability or changes in \nclimate on economic growth.  Brown and Lall (2006) used statistics of rainfall and temperature variability \nin a cross-country analysis of economic level, finding that poor countries tended to have higher levels of \nprecipitation variability.  Dell et al. (2009) evaluated the effects of annual variations in precipitation and \nrainfall over the previous 50 years as a way to estimate potential economic impacts of climate change.  \nUsing national level economic and climate data in a global assessment, their results indicated that higher \ntemperatures had negative consequences in poor countries, while there were no climate effects in wealthy \ncountries.  The effects in poor countries were not limited to agricultural production, as they found \nindustrial output, investment growth and political stability all to be impacted.   Several recent studies have \ninvestigated the effects of climate variability on economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where \nthe largely agrarian based economies may be particularly vulnerable due to low levels of infrastructure \nand lack of large scale insurance mechanisms.  In a review of a wide range of economic data, \nChristiaensen et al. (2002) found that rainfall variations and ill health have profound effects on poverty, \nresulting in a need to social provision of protections against such shocks.  Barrios et al. (2008) provide a \nbroad overview of the ways in which rainfall affects economic activities in Africa.  Their empirical \ninvestigations of agricultural production and GDP growth found that the decline in rainfall that occurred \nbetween the 1960s and 1990s in much of SSA was a major contributor to the reduced agricultural \u00a0 7\nproduction rates and growth rates during that period (Barrios et al., 2008).  According to their estimates, \nthe rainfall decline accounted for a 9 \u2013 23% drop in per capita GDP in SSA relative to levels without such \ndecline in rainfall.  \nA common drawback in previous studies that attempt to assess climate impacts empirically is the form of \nthe precipitation data that is used.  Since socioeconomic data is most widely available at the national \nlevel, climate data must also be aggregated to national spatial scales for use in analysis.  Typically, a \nspatial average of rainfall and temperature over a given country\u2019s national borders is used.   This \naveraging introduces a systematic bias in the resulting rainfall and temperature data due to the smoothing \neffect that averaging causes.  The calculation of a spatial average reduces the variability that is present \nacross a country.  As a result, it underestimates the climate challenges that countries face, especially for \nlarger countries.  The bias is worse for precipitation than for temperature as precipitation tends to be more \nvariable in space.   \nWhile the bias may seem trivial, the way in which precipitation anomalies are expected to affect \neconomic indicators amplified its significance.  In typical economic systems that might be affected by \nrainfall, such as agricultural production, small deviations from normal amounts are likely to have minor \nor negligible impacts, while large deviations may have very large impacts.  This nonlinear response \nmakes the use of spatial averaged rainfall problematic.  The calculation of a spatial average over a country \nmeans a small deviation below the normal rainfall can have the same value as results from a rainfall \npattern of large deviation over a small part of the country and normal rainfall over other parts.  An \nextreme example is the case where part of a country experiences drought while other parts receive normal \nor above normal rainfall.  The resulting spatial average may show normal rainfall.  In addition, when used \nin regression analyses, there\u2019s an implicit assumption of symmetry in the effects of above normal and \nbelow normal rainfall.  This assumption is not supported by the evidence of how such anomalies impact \nsociety.  In addition, previous analyses use calendar year precipitation which is not appropriate in tropical \nclimates where the rainy season occurs over the end of the year, splitting a single season between two \u00a0 8\nyears.  It is perhaps not surprising that rainfall rarely shows up as a significant explanatory variable when \nspatial averaging is employed.   \nThis analysis is distinct from previous work in two important ways.  First, we explore the effects of \nclimate extremes instead of the mean conditions that were the subject of previous studies.  Second, the \nindex used more effectively instruments precipitation variability than the country mean or population \nweighted mean used in previous studies.  In this analysis we employ a precipitation statistic that preserves \nthe spatial signal in rainfall by calculating the percentage of a country that falls below or above thresholds \nbased on deviations from the long term average.  In doing so, we also separate and treat independently the \neffects of positive and negative precipitation anomalies.  This allows the nonlinear effects of precipitation \nvariability to be effectively investigated.  The statistic, Weighted Anomaly Standardized Precipitation \n(WASP; Lyon and Barnston, 2006), is discussed below.   \n \nEmpirical Methods  \nIn this analysis we use fixed effects regressions with economic indicators as dependent variables and \nclimate data as independent variables to attempt to diagnose the economic effects of climate as \nmanifested at the national level.  In doing so we utilize a precise measure of precipitation variability that \nhas qualities which make it superior for identifying associated impacts than other methods typically \nemployed, such as spatially averaged or population weighted precipitation.  All precipitation and \ntemperature data are extracted from the New et al. (2000) gridded 0.5 degree dataset.  Calculation of \nnational temperature and precipitation follow the usual methods of spatially averaging the annual average \nover the domain of each country.  The data are available for 1901 to 2003.  The calculation of the WASP \nindices, which are used to preserve the spatial and temporal variability of precipitation, begins with the \ncalculation of the weighted anomaly standardized precipitation (WASP) time series for each 0.5 degree \ngrid cell.  The WASP calculates deviations in monthly precipitation from their long term mean and then \u00a0 9\nsums those anomalies weighted by the average contribution of each month to the annual total, according \nto the following formula: \nA\ni\nN\nt i\ni i\nN P\nP P P\nS \uf0e5\n\uf03d \uf0f7 \uf0f7\n\uf0f8\n\uf0f6\n\uf0e7 \uf0e7\n\uf0e8\n\uf0e6 \uf02d\n\uf03d\n1 \uf073\n            (1) \nIn (1) Pi and   i P  are the observed precipitation in the ith month and the long term average precipitation \nfor the ith month, \uf073i is the standard deviation of monthly precipitation for the ith month and  A P is the \nmean annual precipitation.  The number of months over which the index is calculated is indicated by N.  \nWe use N = 12 to capture annual precipitation anomalies.  The WASP is designed such that rainfall \nanomalies are measured relative to the typical rainfall for a given month.  Next, in order to produce a \nnational level value from the gridded values, a threshold level is designated (for example, 1 standard \ndeviation) and the total number of cells above and below those thresholds is counted.   \nThis produces a measure of the portion of a country that is experiencing anomalously dry (WASP(-1)) or \nwet (WASP(+1)) over the time period measured.  The result for WASP(-1) is well correlated with drought \nindices, such as the Palmer Drought Severity Index which uses precipitation and temperature to measure \ndrought (Alley, 1984).  The WASP(+1) index indicates a period of anomalously wet conditions but may \nnot indicate flood events.  Floods can occur on short time spans that are not captured by this index which \nis calculated with monthly data.  The WASP(+1) may capture flooding events caused by longer periods of \nrainy conditions that saturate soils and lead to intense flooding events over shorter time periods.  Further \ndetails of the creation of the WASP index and its use in climate analyses can be found in Lyons and \nBarnston (2006). \nFixed effects regressions  \nTo conduct an assessment of countries\u2019 historical sensitivities to climate variation, we use the data \ndescribed above in regressions within several different specifications, including, regressions with country \u00a0 10\nfixed effects, regressions with year and country fixed effects together, regressions with a one-year time \nlag and country fixed effects, and regressions with a one-year time lag and country and year fixed effects.    \nFor the purposes of this paper we focus on four primary livelihood indicators as our outcome variables: \n(1) GDP growth, (2) agricultural GDP value added, (3) industrial GDP value added, and (4) poverty \nheadcount ratio at national poverty line (% of population).  The data used for this study covers the period \n1961 \u2013 2003.  \nWe also perform these regressions using both fixed effects and random effects. The specifications for \nthese regressions are shown below.   \nCountry Fixed effects  \nUsing fixed effects with a linear model, we de-mean the variables to remove the time-invariant \nunobserved characteristics that are correlated with the other regressors in the equation.  In these \nregressions, such time-invariant characteristics include, for example, the geographical characteristics of a \ncountry.   \nWe begin with a basic fixed effects regression using the panel data for all 133 countries included in our \nsample.  \n  Y it = \u03b2X it + \u03b1i +   it    i= 1,.. , 133 and t= 1, \u2026, T \nwhere  Yit represents a livelihood measure of country i at time t, X it represents climate measures for \ncountry i at time t, \u03b1i  is the fixed effect and therefore represents the sum of all time-invariant aspects of \ncountry i, and \u03f5 it represents time-variant factors, which are typically not known by the countries before \nthe time period occurs. We can also add controls for other variables, such as mean annual temperature and \nprecipitation for country i. The unobserved country effects are coefficients on dummy variables for each \ncountry.  \u00a0 11\nIf we could observe all of the time-invariant country characteristics, then we could use a single cross-\nsection regression of the livelihood indicators on the climate variables. But in such situations, we often \ncannot observe all of the relevant time-invariant country characteristics, and therefore cross-sectional \nestimates can be inconsistent.  This is the benefit of using fixed effects instead of cross-country \nregressions; we control for the fact that the climate variability might depend (at least to some extent) on \nthe time-invariant characteristics, which would therefore be correlated.  \nStandard errors are clustered at the country level. Clustering the standard errors at the country-level \nallows for potential correlation between observations for any given country at different times.  Without \nclustering the standard errors, we may be overstating the relationship, and the significance of such a \nrelationship, between variables included in the analysis.  \nThese regressions are performed for each of the four abovementioned outcome variables: (1) GDP \ngrowth, (2) agricultural GDP value added (%), (3) industrial GDP value added (%), and (4) poverty \nheadcount ratio at national poverty line (% of population).  \nIn addition, these regressions are then repeated, using one-year lagged values of independent variables on \nthe right hand side of the equation.  \n  Y it = \u03b2X it-1 + \u03b1i +   it-1    i= 1,.. , 133 and t= 1, \u2026, T \nFor example, these regressions estimate the impact of last year\u2019s climate conditions on this year\u2019s GDP \ngrowth.   \nCountry and Year Fixed effects  \nIn these regressions we start with the same base regression as before, but we now add a year effect, \u03a6t, to \nthe fixed effects regression described above. Standard errors are clustered at the country level. \nYit = \u03b2X it + \u03b1i + \u03a6t  +   it    i= 1,.. , 133 and t= 1, \u2026, T \u00a0 12\nThe unobserved year effects are coefficients on dummy variables for each year included in the panel of \ndata.  As with the country fixed effects regressions, we repeat these regressions using one-year lagged \nvalues of the independent variables on the right hand side of the equation.   \n \nDiscussion of Results \nThe regressions of economic statistics were conducted to attempt to identify whether there is evidence of \na climate signal on the economic activity indicators of the nations of the world.   The results are reported \nin Tables 1 \u2013 8 and are discussed below.   The tables show the regression coefficient and the standard \nerror in parentheses for each climate variable.  Statistically significant regression coefficients are \nindicated with asterisks.  Table 1 presents the summary results for each of the dependent variables for the \nmost robust model specification, fixed country and year effects. \n \nGDP per capita growth is the most widely used and available measure of economic growth at the national \nlevel.  Here the analyses were conducted with data from approximately 180 nations.  The most striking \nresult of the analysis of GDP growth is the negative influence of the WASP(-1) (moderate drought) \nstatistic at the 99% level statistical significance.  This result was consistent in all regression \nspecifications.  Other results varied by specification.  \n \n \n \n \n \u00a0 13\nTable 1.

The WASP_plus1_1, WASP_minus1_1 and Temp_1 variables are lagged \nby one year.   \n \nThe results from the specification with fixed country and year effects are presented in Table 2.   These are \nthe most robust model specifications and therefore the most meaningful results.  The model with \ntemperature and precipitation as the two independent variables showed temperature to be significant at the \n95% level and precipitation at the 90% level.  Interestingly, the sign of the regression coefficients were \npositive in both cases.  The sign implies that a warmer year coincides with higher economic growth for \nthe countries of the world, and similarly for (more) precipitation.    However, when the WASP variables \nwere included, temperature was no longer significant.  Instead, the WASP(-1) variable was significant at \nthe 99% confidence level and the WASP(+1) variable was significant at the 90% level.  In both cases, the \nregression coefficients were negative, indicating that a greater area of a country in drought (WASP(-1)) \ncoincided with less (or negative) economic growth,.  The coefficients indicate that a 1 % increase in the \nfraction of a country\u2019s area undergoing drought causes a 2.7 reduction in GDP growth for a given year.   \nMore area with anomalously high rainfall or flooding (WASP(+1)) also coincided with reduced economic \u00a0 14\ngrowth.  In this case, a 1% increase in the area of a country experiencing high rainfall coincides with a \n1.8% reduction in GDP growth. These results support the hypothesis of the economic importance of \nprecipitation extremes.   \nTable 2: GDP per Capita Growth with Country and Year FE\u2019s  \nDependent variable: GDP per Capita Growth \n  (Precip)  (Temp)  (P, T)  (W+1)  (T,W+1)  (W-1)  (T,W-1)             (T,W-1,W+1)  (W-1,W+1) \n \nPrecip   0.01   0.01        \n  ( 0 . 0 1 )    ( 0 . 0 1 ) *         \nTemp    0.41  0.44   0.28   0.28   0.08 \n   (0.21)**  (0.21)**   (0.25)   (0.27)   (0.32) \nWASP_minus1       -2.02  -2.08   -2.67  -2.69 \n       (0.51)***(0.52)***  (0.98)***(0.98)*** \nWASP_plus1     0.25  0.29     -1.83  -1.82 \n     ( 0 . 5 2 )   ( 0 . 5 2 )      ( 1 . 0 8 ) *   ( 1 . 0 8 ) *  \n \nObservations  4898 4898 4898 2790 2790 2962 2962   1686 1686 \nCountries  181 181 181 178 178 180 180   133 133 \nR-squared  0.047 0.048 0.048 0.057 0.057 0.050 0.051   0.053 0.053 \n \nNotes: Columns represent model specifications.

P = Precipitation; T = Temperature; \nW+1 = WASP(+1); W-1 = WASP(-1). \n \nThe results for the country fixed effects are reported in Table 3.  They are similar to the results with \ncountry and year fixed effects.  With country fixed effects only, events that affect many countries in a \ngiven year, say a currency crisis that affects a region, are not accounted for.   However, drought can affect \nmultiple countries in a given year due to its often regional or larger span.  For example, droughts caused \nby ENSO have a global pattern that affects different parts of most continents.  Controlling for year fixed \neffects may cause an underestimation of the drought effect.  Therefore, we generate these results with \nonly country fixed effects.   \nAgain, the WASP variables were significant with signs that were consistent with expectations.  The \nWASP(-1) variable was again significant at the 99% confidence level.  Similarly, WASP(+1) was \nsignificant at the 90% level.  Each had negative regression coefficients and the WASP(-1) coefficient is \u00a0 15\nlarger (-2.9) than when year fixed effects were controlled for.  Temperature was not significant when the \nWASP variables were included.  However, when temperature and precipitation were included as the only \nindependent variables, this time precipitation was significant but temperature was not.  The regression \ncoefficient for precipitation was positive.  This result implies that the significance of national average \nprecipitation and temperature is sensitive to specification and does not provide much confidence in the \nmeaning of the statistical significance.    \nTable 3: GDP per Capita Growth with Country FE\u2019s  \nDependent variable: GDP per Capita Growth \n  (Precip)  (Temp)  (P, T)  (W+1)  (T,W+1)  (W-1)  (T,W-1)             (T,W-1,W+1)  (W-1,W+1) \nPrecip   0.01   0.02        \n  (0.01)***  (0.01)***        \nTemp    0.15  0.18   0.08   0.12    -0.12 \n   (0.17)  (0.17)   (0.21)   (0.22)    (0.26) \nWASP_minus1       -2.19  -2.22   -2.91  -2.88 \n       (0.51)***(0.51)***  (0.97)***(0.98)*** \n \nWASP_plus1     0.62  0.63     -1.89  -1.89 \n     ( 0 . 5 2 )   ( 0 . 5 2 )      ( 1 . 0 8 ) *   ( 1 . 0 8 ) *  \n  \nObservations  4898 4898 4898 2790 2790 2962 2962   1686 1686 \nCountries  181 181 181 178 178 180 180   133 133 \nR-squared  0.001 0.000 0.002 0.001 0.001 0.007 0.007   0.006 0.006 \n \nNotes: Columns represent model specifications.

P = Precipitation; T = Temperature; \nW+1 = WASP(+1); W-1 = WASP(-1). \n \nThe regressions on the agricultural value added for the nations of the world provided our most difficult \ninterpretation of results.  Overall, in our most robust model specification none of the climate variables \nwere statistically significant.  In some specifications temperature and the WASP(-1) variable were \nsignificant.  It is likely due to the selection of agricultural valued added as the dependent variable.  Since \nthis is a percent of a nation\u2019s GDP, its value can increase even when actual agricultural GDP decreases if \ntotal GDP decreases at a greater rate.  For these reason we present these results with caution.  \n \u00a0 16\nWith fixed effects for the country and the year (Table 4), the results of regression on temperature and \nprecipitation as the independent variables showed temperature to be significant at the 95% confidence \nlevel.  Somewhat strangely, in this case the regression coefficient was negative, which is opposite in \ndirection to the effect on per capita GDP growth.   When the WASP(-1) variable is included with \ntemperature, the WASP variable is significant at the 95% level while temperature is no longer significant.  \nThe sign of the regression coefficient for the WASP(-1) variable is again negative, which is consistent \nthrough all model specifications.  When the WASP(+1) is included with WASP(-1) and temperature, \nnone of the variables retain their significance.  This is the result reported in summary Table 1.   \nTable 4: Agricultural Value Added with Country and Year FE\u2019s  \nDependent variable: Agricultural Value Added \n  (Precip)  (Temp)  (P, T)  (W+1)  (T,W+1)  (W-1)  (T,W-1)             (T,W-1,W+1)  (W-1,W+1) \n \nPrecip   0.01   0.01        \n  ( 0 . 0 0 ) *    ( 0 . 0 0 )         \nTemp    -0.45  -0.44   -0.15   -0.13    0.13 \n   (0.19)**  (0.19)**   (0.26)   (0.26)    (0.33) \nWASP_minus1       -1.19  -1.17   -0.83  -0.85 \n       ( 0 . 4 7 ) * *   ( 0 . 4 8 ) * *    ( 1 . 0 4 )   ( 1 . 0 4 )  \nWASP_plus1     0.55  0.54     0.60  0.61 \n     ( 0 . 5 4 )   ( 0 . 5 4 )      ( 1 . 1 7 )   ( 1 . 1 7 )  \n \nObservations  4286 4286 4286 2360 2360 2523 2523   1418 1418 \nCountries  171 171 171 166 166 167 167   120 120 \nR-squared  0.152 0.153 0.153 0.155 0.155 0.188 0.188   0.177 0.177 \n \n \nNotes: Columns represent model specifications.

Again, the regression coefficient sign is negative, which is not \nconsistent with the per capita GDP growth results.  This result may be caused by an increasing trend in \ntemperature and a generally decreasing percent of GDP that agriculture plays in most economies.  For this \u00a0 17\nreason, and since temperature was not significant in the more robust model specification when the WASP \nvariables were included, we do not conclude that there is a meaningful temperature result.      \nThe regression analysis using industrial value added and poverty headcount as the dependent variables did \nnot yield any statistically significant results (Not reported here).  In the case of industrial value added this \nrepresents a marked difference with the findings of the Sub Saharan Africa \u2013 only analysis.  In that case, \nindustrial value added was sensitive to drought.  The large percentage of electricity generated through \nhydroelectricity, and the portion of industrial activity that is related to agriculture are the likely causative \nlinks.  However, using the global dataset the wide heterogeneity of industrial activity and energy sources \nreduces the effects of climate on industry in most developed countries.   \nTable 5: Agricultural Value Added with Country FE\u2019s  \nDependent variable: Agricultural Value Added \n  (Precip)  (Temp)  (P, T)  (W+1)  (T,W+1)  (W-1)  (T,W-1)             (T,W-1,W+1)  (W-1,W+1) \nPrecip   0.01   0.01        \n  ( 0 . 0 0 ) * *    ( 0 . 0 0 )         \nTemp    -2.32  -2.31   -2.10   -2.35    -1.98 \n   (0.17)***(0.17)***  (0.22)***  (0.22)***   (0.28)*** \nWASP_minus1       -1.18  -0.75   -0.48  -0.16 \n       ( 0 . 5 1 ) * *   ( 0 . 5 0 )    ( 1 . 1 1 )   ( 1 . 0 9 )  \nWASP_plus1     0.31  0.23     0.41  0.50 \n     ( 0 . 5 8 )   ( 0 . 5 6 )      ( 1 . 2 6 )   ( 1 . 2 3 )  \n  \nObservations  4286 4286 4286 2360 2360 2523 2523   1418 1418 \nCountries  171 171 171 166 166 167 167   120 120 \nR-squared  0.001 0.045 0.046 0.000 0.040 0.002 0.048   0.000 0.038 \n \n \nNotes: Columns represent model specifications.

P = Precipitation; T = Temperature; \nW+1 = WASP(+1); W-1 = WASP(-1). \nThe analysis of poverty headcount was not informative due to the small sample size (Not reported here).  \nFor most countries only a small number of observations were available.      \nLagged regression analyses were conducted using the data for dependent variables for the year that \nfollows the values of the independent variables.  These analyses are an attempt to identify impacts that \nmight be delayed in their effect on economic activities.  For example, when a drought hits, a household \u00a0 18\nmay be able to maintain a portion of their consumption through the year of the drought through accessing \nsome form of savings.  But in smoothing consumption in the current year there is a negative impact in \ntheir productivity in the following year.  It may be a reduction in their ability to invest in productive \nactivities (e.g., fertilizer or other inputs) or a reduced appetite for investment after suffering a year of loss.  \nTherefore, the impacts of a climate anomaly such as drought may be expected to affect the current year \nand the following year\u2019s economic activities negatively.  This effect is investigated through the lagged \nregressions.   \nTable 6a: Lagged GDP per Capita Growth With Country and Year FE\u2019s  \nDependent variable: GDP per Capita Growth \n  (Precip)  (Temp)  (P, T)  (W+1)  (T,W+1)  (W-1)  (T,W-1)             (T,W-1,W+1)  (W-1,W+1) \n \nPrecip_1   -0.00   -0.01        \n  ( 0 . 0 0 )    ( 0 . 0 0 )         \nTemp_1    0.05  0.06   0.10   0.01    -0.06 \n   (0.05)  (0.05)   (0.08)   (0.07)    (0.10) \nWASP_minus1 (lag)      0.48  0.48   -1.82  -1.78 \n       ( 0 . 4 7 )   ( 0 . 4 7 )    ( 1 . 0 0 ) *   ( 1 . 0 1 ) *  \nWASP_plus1 (lag)     -0.42  -0.38     -2.90  -2.86 \n     (0.54)  (0.54)     (1.11)***(1.11)** \n \nObservations  4897 4897 4897 2782 2782 2955 2955   1677 1677 \nCountries  181 181 181 178 178 180 180   137 137 \nR-squared  0.047 0.047 0.048 0.048 0.049 0.065 0.065   0.065 0.065 \n \nNotes: Columns represent model specifications.

For per capita GDP growth (Table 6), the WASP variables, both drought and flood, were the \nsole statistically significant factors.  The signs of the regression coefficients were negative in all cases, \nanother sign of consistency.  The results for WASP(+1) were slightly stronger (99%) than for WASP(-1) \n(90%) in the lagged regressions, a reversal in ordering from the concurrent regressions.  This result may \nindicate that flood effects, which WASP(+1) may be indicative of, have greater longer term effects due to \u00a0 19\ntheir destructive capacity.  For example, while a drought may reduce savings and investment, a flood can \ndestroy all savings and capital, damage infrastructure such as roadways and contribute to disease such as \ncholera.  All told, these impacts may have longer term effects on economic activities than a drought.   \nTable 6b: Lagged GDP per Capita Growth with Country FE\u2019s  \nDependent variable: GDP per Capita Growth \n  (Precip)  (Temp)  (P, T)  (W+1)  (T,W+1)  (W-1)  (T,W-1)             (T,W-1,W+1)  (W-1,W+1) \nPrecip_1   -0.00   -0.00        \n  ( 0 . 0 0 )    ( 0 . 0 0 )         \nTemp_1    0.04  0.04   0.05   0.01    -0.01 \n   (0.05)  (0.05)   (0.07)   (0.07)    (0.10) \nWASP_minus1 (lag)      0.35  0.34   -2.20  -2.19 \n       ( 0 . 4 7 )   ( 0 . 4 8 )    ( 1 . 0 1 ) * *   ( 1 . 0 1 ) * *  \nWASP_plus1 (lag)     -0.23  -0.22     -2.64  -2.63 \n     ( 0 . 5 4 )   ( 0 . 5 5 )      ( 1 . 1 2 ) * *   ( 1 . 1 2 ) * *  \n \nObservations  4897 4897 4897 2782 2782 2955 2955   1677 1677 \nCountries  181 181 181 178 178 180 180   137 137 \nR-squared  0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000   0.005 0.005 \n \nNotes: Columns represent model specifications.

The WASP_plus1_1, WASP_minus1_1 and Temp_1 variables are lagged by \none year.   \n \nThe lagged regression results for agricultural value added (Table 7) were also generally consistent with \nthe concurrent regressions.  Here, however, temperature was weakly significant (90% level) while no \nother variables were significant.  The sign of the regression coefficient for agriculture was negative, \nimplying higher temperatures coincide with lower agricultural value added.  It is difficult to explain how \na temperature effect would have a lagged impact but it may be a result of a trend present in the \ntemperature variable.  For example, it is well known that global temperatures are increasing measured \nglobally, and the same is true regionally and for most countries.  With this trend in place, any trend in \nagricultural value added will appear correlated with the temperature trend, although it may be caused by \nother factors such as the decreasing role of agriculture in the economies of many industrialized countries.  \u00a0 20\nThe strong significance of the WASP variables in the concurrent regressions may have masked this effect, \nbut in the lagged regressions it stands out as the only significant explanatory variable.   \nTable 7a: Lagged Agricultural Value Added With Country and Year FE\u2019s  \nDependent variable: Agricultural Value Added \n  (Precip)  (Temp)  (P, T)  (W+1)  (T,W+1)  (W-1)  (T,W-1)             (T,W-1,W+1)  (W-1,W+1) \nPrecip_1   0.01   0.01        \n  ( 0 . 0 0 ) * *    ( 0 . 0 0 ) * *         \nTemp_1    -0.04  -0.06   -0.21   -0.03    -0.29 \n   (0.06)  (0.06)   (0.10)**   (0.09)    (0.17)* \nWASP_minus1 (lag)      -0.80  -0.79   0.73  0.87 \n       ( 0 . 4 7 ) *   ( 0 . 4 8 ) *    ( 1 . 0 4 )   ( 1 . 0 4 )  \nWASP_plus1 (lag)     0.49  0.40     0.44  0.54 \n     ( 0 . 5 2 )   ( 0 . 5 3 )      ( 1 . 1 8 )   ( 1 . 1 8 )  \n \n \nObservations  4286 4286 4286 2352 2352 2528 2528   1416 1416 \nCountries  171 171 171 166 166 169 169   125 125 \nR-squared  0.152 0.152 0.153 0.150 0.152 0.175 0.175   0.160 0.162 \n \n \nNotes: Columns represent model specifications.

Here the WASP(+1) variable stands out as the sole significant explanatory \nclimate variable over all model specifications.  It is significant at the 95% level and the regression \ncoefficients are all negative.  Damage to capital and infrastructure is likely the cause of the negative \nimpact of excessive rainfall.  This result is especially significant given the large body of anecdotal \nevidence of major flood damages and expected economic effects and yet the nonexistent evidence of \nthese effects in any multi-country econometric analyses.  This is due to the lack of a consistent database \nof flood events and flood hazard exposure that is climate based.  Instead, existing flood databases are \ncollected by impacts and thus are biased in reporting flood significance not by their hydrologic \nmagnitude, which is largely exogenous, but rather by their economic or social impact, which is largely \nendogenous.  As a result, the economic effects of flood risk and effects are likely underestimated in the \nliterature.  This result is the first that the authors are aware of that demonstrates a statistically significant \nflood effect on national level economic variables in a multi-country analysis.   \nTable 8a: Lagged Industrial Value Added With Country and Year FE\u2019s  \nDependent variable: Industrial Value Added \n  (Precip)  (Temp)  (P, T)  (W+1)  (T,W+1)  (W-1)  (T,W-1)             (T,W-1,W+1)  (W-1,W+1) \nPrecip_1   -0.00   -0.00        \n  ( 0 . 0 0 )    ( 0 . 0 0 )         \nTemp_1    -0.03  -0.03   -0.07   -0.07    -0.06 \n   (0.05)  (0.05)   (0.06)   (0.06)    (0.08) \nWASP_minus1_1      -0.07  -0.06   -0.38  -0.36 \n       ( 0 . 1 1 )   ( 0 . 1 1 )    ( 0 . 2 4 )   ( 0 . 2 4 )  \nWASP_plus1_1     -0.28  -0.29     -0.55  -0.56 \n     (0.13)**  (0.13)**     (0.27)**  (0.27)** \n  \n \nObservations  2760 2760 2760 1737 1737 1830 1830   1117 1117 \nCountries  129 129 129 127 127 126 126   105 105 \nR-squared  0.049 0.049 0.050 0.059 0.060 0.046 0.047   0.061 0.062 \n \n \nNotes: Columns represent model specifications.

The current literature is conflicted \non the significance climate variables that affect GDP growth. The results of this analysis strongly support \nthe hypothesis that anomalously low rainfall (drought) and anomalously heavy rainfall (possibly \nassociated with flooding) are the key climate effects on GDP growth, overwhelming any temperature \neffect.   \nProjections of climate change impacts on GDP growth often utilize projected temperature changes from \nGeneral Circulation Models (GCM) applied to an estimated temperature effect.  The results of this \nanalysis imply that the greater economic impacts from climate change will be due to changes in \nprecipitation variability.  Most significantly, an increase in drought area in a country of 1% was found to \u00a0 23\ncause a 2.8% reduction in annual GDP growth rate.  Unfortunately, estimates of precipitation from GCM \ntend to be less skillful than projections of temperature.  The projections of mean changes in precipitation \nare often characterized by wide ranges and in some cases disagreement on the direction of change.  The \nability to project variability of rainfall is also less skillful than mean projections of temperature or \nprecipitation.   Given our findings, it would be very helpful to have increased ability to project future \nprecipitation variability for estimating future impacts of climate change and identifying adaptation \npriorities.    \nWhile estimating future exposure to drought and flood remains problematic, it is clear from these results \nthat historical levels of precipitation variability already impede economic progress.  Managing this \nhydroclimatic risk in the future is likely to be more difficult because of the changing climate conditions \nthat may alter the historical frequency of floods and drought.  Traditional engineering methods for \ndesigning and managing water resources infrastructure and institutions use the historical hydrologic \nrecord as guidance.  Our knowledge of climate variability and change implies that this may not be a valid \nassumption to base water management on in the future.  New methods that are able to respond \ndynamically to evolving climate conditions will be necessary.  This is an open and fairly nascent area of \nresearch.  The results of this analysis imply that it is a quite important one for future economic growth.  \n \nConclusion  \nThe analysis presented in this paper was conducted to identify the influences of climate on economic \nactivities in the countries of the world.  Based on previous research and the published literature, \nprecipitation, temperature and statistics of precipitation variability were investigated as explanatory \nvariables in fixed effects regressions of economic activity statistics over several decades.  Several model \nspecifications were utilized to increase the robustness of any findings derived from the regression results.  \nThe analysis resulted in several significant findings.   \u00a0 24\nThe most important result of this analysis is the identification of the WASP(-1) and WASP(+1) variables \nas the most significant climate factors in the regressions on GDP growth.  The results are important for \nseveral reasons.  First, they contradict the findings of previous studies that identify temperature as the \nmost influential climate variable on GDP growth.  Previous studies have used a coarse measure for \nprecipitation that may obscure the precipitation effect.  The WASP variables preserve the spatial \nvariability, and the nonlinearity and asymmetry of precipitation effects and hence better capture their \nimpacts on economic activity.  Second, the prevailing thinking on climate change presumes that \ntemperature is the key climate impact on economic activities.  Estimates of temperature effects on \neconomic growth are typically used in static projections of the economic impacts of climate change.  This \nanalysis shows that those projections are likely to be too simplistic.  Precipitation variability has a \nstronger influence on economic growth than temperature.  This complicates climate change impact \nassessments, since much more uncertainty surrounds projections of precipitation than temperature.     \nFinally, these results should influence strategy for adaptation to climate change.  These findings indicate \nthat national economies are impeded by precipitation anomalies, periods of too much or too little \nprecipitation.  To prevent increasing damage to economic progress as a result of a changing climate, these \nresults imply that adaptation strategies should focus on reducing the negative consequences of \nprecipitation extremes.  Hence, security of water resources should be a priority topic for adaptation \nplanning. \nAnother interesting finding from this analysis was the significant effect of the WASP(+1) variable on \nGDP growth and on Industrial value added.   The WASP(+1) is indicative of excess rainfall that may be \nassociated with flooding.  As discussed earlier, flooding is difficult to specify using monthly precipitation \ndata.  Unfortunately, there is a lack of globally available daily precipitation or streamflow data that could \nbe used to more precisely describe flood risk for a particular country.  Nonetheless, the results of the \nregression analysis using WASP(+1) are consistent with expectations for a flood effect.  The WASP(+1) \nvariable was found to be a significant explanatory variable for GDP growth at a slightly less significance \u00a0 25\nthan the WASP(-1) for the concurrent regressions.   Interestingly, the effects were stronger for regressions \non GDP and industrial value added at a one year lag.  In both cases the WASP(+1) was significant at a \n95% confidence level.  Regression coefficients were consistently negative, implying a negative impact of \nexcess rainfall.  The greater lagged effect may imply that the excess rainfall was associated with flooding \nthat impacted infrastructure.  The damage to infrastructure then resulted in reduced output in terms of \nGDP and industrial value added, both of which may be expected to be more dependent on infrastructure \nthan agriculture.  This offers the tentative evidence of a flood effect on these variables in a multi-country \nanalysis.  Evidence from case studies of individual flood impacts and of single countries is consistent with \nthis finding.   However, a better flood index is needed to explore this effect with more confidence. \nIn sum, this study has found evidence that climate has a statistically significant impact on economic \ngrowth of the countries of the world, and precipitation variability, as characterized by the WASP indices, \nis the most significant effect.  These represent new findings with important implications for how we \nconceive the relationship between climate and economic growth and how we prioritize adaptation \nactivities. \n \n \n \n \nAcknowledgements \nThe authors acknowledgement the encouragement, contributions and comments of Claudia Sadoff, David \nGrey, Nagaraja Harshadeep, Marianne Fay and Alexander Lotsch.

While it is true that climate change \nwill have considerable impact on the national security of states around the world, the link \nbetween climate change hazards and security threats is not direct.  The academic literature \nhas been haphazard in presenting a theoretically consistent paradigm for assessing the \nsecurity implications of climate change.  Because of its global scale and the regional \nvariation of specific climate change hazards, the traditional, human and environmental \nsecurity paradigms need to be reconciled to ascertain how conflict develops from climate \nchange hazards and predict the probability of conflict scenarios developing at a given \nlocation.  The generalised focus of many previous studies of the security implications of \nclimate change failed to take into account that while climate change is a global phenomenon, \nspecific climate change hazards are more likely to manifest within a bounded geographical \nregion.  The challenge for analysts of international relations therefore is to compile security \nanalyses that are location-specific and practical for policy implementation.  This paper \npresents a four-step framework for mapping how climate change hazards can lead to human, \nenvironmental and national security problems at specific locations.  The paper will \ndemonstrate the framework by analysing three case studies: south-eastern Australia, north-\neastern China, and Darfur in western Sudan.  In each case the primary climate hazard is \ndecreased rainfall and drought, though each is characterised by remarkably different political \nsystems, economic capacities, social cleavages and institutional strengths. \n\u00a0\u00a0\nDefining\u00a0an\u00a0Appropriate\u00a0Security\u00a0Paradigm\u00a0\nFor an environmental problem to be classified as a traditional security threat, it must have \nsome demonstrable connection to a vital national interest, which can be enhanced or defended \nthrough the application of military, economic and political power (Matthew et al. 2009, 7; \nGleick 1991, 18).  In the past, few environmental problems have satisfied that criteria \nbecause they tended to be localised or manifest as cumulative problems over distant time \nhorizons, neither of which posed a threat to the core interests of states.  Climate change, \nhowever, presents a complicated challenge to the traditional security paradigm.  It is a global \nproblem, creating hazard phenomena that spread beyond local areas and even state \nboundaries, which will manifest at a higher frequency and intensity than in the past.   \n \nThese hazards are likely to challenge the vital interests of many states and for some, even \ntheir very survival, yet because of their global scope they do not conform to the state-centric \nconceptions of security that divide the world into mutually-exclusive territorial entities and  \ndo not challenge the structure of economic and military power relations between states \n(Homer-Dixon 1991, 83).  The impacts of climate change will be felt at the local level and \nexperienced differently by people according to their position in the social hierarchy and the \ninstitutional capacities of the region in which they live.    Because citizens within countries \ndo not enjoy equality in this regard, change the assumption that national security equates to \nsecurity for all citizens of a state does not hold (Foster 2001, 381).   \n \nProponents of the human security paradigm therefore argue that the appropriate reference \npoint for security analysis should be the individual human being and not the state.  Harmful \ndisruptions to human wellbeing and the patterns of daily life for individuals in vulnerable \nareas are said to lie at the heart of the underlying reasons why conflict occurs.  Conflict is \nmore likely where physical safety and secure access to food, water, housing, employment and \n\u00a0 2\nArchived at Flinders University: dspace.flinders.edu.au\nhealth care are not available (Matthew et al. 2009, 377-8; Myers 1993, 31-2).  The provision \nof these goods is usually the jurisdiction of civilian institutions, the weakness, failure of \nabsence of which can determine the probability of conflict in a given context.  The challenge \nof climate change adaptation is therefore unlikely to be something for which military forces \nare ideally suited.  Oli Brown et al (2007, 1153-4) warn against the definition of climate as a \ntraditional security issue because of the danger that securitisation will push states toward \ncostly and inappropriate measures that may actually harm their adaptive responses to climate \nchange.  Indeed the appropriate responses for many socio-economic impacts of climate \nchange hazards will lie in realm of public policy. \n \nEnvironmental security was a natural outgrowth of the human security paradigm (Barnett \n2007, 5).1  Lester Brown (1977, 37) pioneered work in this area, arguing that unfolding \nstresses in the relationship between human societies and the Earth\u2019s natural systems initially \nmanifest as ecological problems and resource scarcities, which create economic instabilities \nthat ultimately translate into social unrest and political volatility.  However, direct causal \nrelationships between environmental variables alone and threats to national interest were not \neasy to demonstrate.  To address this dilemma, Thomas Homer-Dixon (1991, 85-6) proposed \na framework for charting the development of conflict from environmental problems, \nidentifying population pressures and human activities in combination with ecosystem \nvulnerability as the drivers of environmental degradation, that in turn generate negative social \noutcomes culminating in different types of conflict.  The framework put forward in this paper \nattempts to expand on the idea that security implications arise when environmental \ndegradation interacts with pre-existing problems in human systems. \n \nNevertheless, many climate security studies focused on the resource scarcity aspect of \nclimate change as the primary driver of security threats.   In a 2003 report commissioned by \nthe Pentagon, Peter Schwartz and Doug Randall (2003) postulated that climate change would \nproduce security threats by reducing the carrying capacity of states throughout the world \nthrough declining availability of food, water and energy.  According to this model, when \nscarcity pressures arise, competition may emerge between rival claimants of scarce resources, \nresulting in violence if cooperative and conflict resolution mechanisms fail.  Violence acts as \na negative feedback on resource scarcity, as conflicting parties increase their resource \nconsumption to prosecute armed campaigns and refugees fleeing conflict zones create new \nresource pressures in the regions in which they settle (Brown et al. 2007, 1148).  Schwartz \nand Randall\u2019s (2003, 2) finding that climate change could potentially destabilize the \ngeopolitical environment through increasing resource constraints is based on the Malthusian \nassumption that the responses of human societies to scarcity pressures automatically lead to \nviolence, which does not however accord with the evidence for environment and scarcity-\nbased conflict (Michel 2009, 77; Yoffe et al. 2003).2   \n \nLater studies have moved beyond the linear relationship between climate change, resource \nscarcity and conflict.  For Alan Dupont (2008) and Jon Barnett and Neil Adger (2007), \nclimate change is expected to become a stress multiplier for all countries, with heightened \nrisk of civil conflict in those states already at risk from internal instability and economic \nweakness.  Climate change hazards are likely to catalyse the development of conflict \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n1 Jon Barnett has defined environmental security as the ability of individuals to exist free from direct violence \nby avoiding or adapting to environmental change so that the variables determining their wellbeing\u2014those \nidentified in the human security literature\u2014are not substantially undermined.   \n2 For example, in instances of water-related disputes between riparian states sharing trans-boundary river basins, \ncooperation has far outweighed conflict as the means of dispute resolution.  \n\u00a0 3\nArchived at Flinders University: dspace.flinders.edu.au\nscenarios through interaction with other problems such as poverty, the availability of \nweapons, ethnic tensions, external indebtedness, weak institutional capacity and state \nlegitimacy.  The risk that a given location will be vulnerable to civil disturbance will be \ndetermined by its adaptive capacity.  The adaptive capacity of human systems in a given \nlocation describes their ability to reduce exposure to and recover from damage caused by \nclimate change hazards (Garg and Halsnaes 2007, 19).  When adaptive capacity is high, \npublic policy responses will be sufficient to manage crises, however, where adaptive capacity \nis low, responses will be inadequate, increasing the risk of adverse security developments.   \n \nClearly then, violent conflict triggered by climate change will proliferate overwhelmingly \nwithin vulnerable states.  This is the point of view of developing countries, which see climate \nchange as a direct threat to their national survival through domestic societal implosion.  \nBecause they generally have low adaptive capacity, developing countries often lack the \ninstitutional capabilities to respond to climate change hazards with appropriate public policy \nresponses.  Developed nations have a different conception of the security implications of \nclimate change because they are generally better able to adapt to climate change hazards and \nthus will be less prone to internal unrest.  They typically see climate change as a threat to \ntheir national security through international instability, as climate hazards in one country \ncreate problems that spread risk to others, generating political friction and possibly violent \nconflict (Michel 2009, 84-5; Barnett 2007, 1364-5).  For developed countries, climate change \nis a national security issue in the traditional sense because it is likely to necessitate military \ndeployments in the form of disaster relief operations, humanitarian intervention, policing and \nstabilisation missions.  Because of this dichotomy of perspectives, the challenge for academic \ncommunity is to reconcile traditional, environmental and human security paradigms into an \nanalytical framework that can identify the security implications of climate change hazards \nspecific to any given location.  By making the analysis location-specific, the tension between \nthe competing security discourses can be overcome. \n \nClimate\u00a0Security\u00a0Analysis:\u00a0A\u00a0Four\u00adstep\u00a0Framework\u00a0\nThis paper sets out a four-step conceptual framework within which sense can be made of the \ncomplex relationship between climate change and national security.  First, it isolates a \nspecific location for study and the climate change hazards that will affect that location.  \nSecond, it identifies vulnerable human systems at that location, documents past damage and \nestimates the risk of future damage caused by exposure to climate change hazards.  Third, it \nevaluates the adaptive capacity of affected human systems and uses this assessment to \npinpoint past and future socio-economic consequences of climate hazard exposure.  \nEnvironmental and human security issues occur at this level.  Finally, traditional security \nimplications are distinguished at the local, state and international levels that may be caused \nby socio-economic weaknesses at the location in question.  By applying this framework to \nany given location, it will be possible to identify climate-related security threats without over-\ngeneralisation due to lack of specificity. \n \n(1)\u00a0Climate\u00a0Change\u00a0Hazard\u00a0\nThe first step of the climate security framework will classify one, many or all climate change \nhazards affecting a specific location.  A climate change hazard is a process or event that has \nthe potential to create loss in human social, economic and political systems through its \ntransformative effect on the biosphere (F\u00fcssel 2007, 157-8).  The three key factors to \nconsider here are: (1) the location for analysis, (2) the specific climate change hazards that \n\u00a0 4\nArchived at Flinders University: dspace.flinders.edu.au\nwill impact on that location, and (3) the expected level of  hazard exposure.  The greater the \nexposure to climate change hazards, the greater the damage and disruption sustained by \nhuman systems, leading to an increased stress on the adaptive capacity of the location in \nquestion (Schneider et al. 2007, 791). \n \nAny analysis of the security implications of climate change must be made on a location-\nspecific basis because the nature of hazard risk differs according to the unique characteristics \nof ecological and social systems (Barnett 2007, 2).   Different localities will be subject to \ndifferent types of climate hazards, at varying levels of risk.  Some regions, for example, are \nsensitive to variations in rainfall, some are susceptible to changes in temperature and others \nmore vulnerable to sea-level rise.  Given that ecological and social environments are usually \ndiverse even within the confines of individual states, the \u201clocation\u201d in this context must refer \nto a specific, bounded geographic region.  While considerable ambiguity exists over the \nprecise future impacts of climate change hazards, this location-specific framework allows the \nanalyst to prepare a more realistic risk assessment of possible security issues for a given \nlocality than can otherwise be deduced from general summations of the climate-security \nnexus.  Without such specificity, any study of climate-security risk becomes too vague and \ndiffuse to be of any practical value. \n \n\u00a0(2)\u00a0Impact\u00a0of\u00a0Climate\u00a0Hazard\u00a0on\u00a0Human\u00a0Systems\u00a0\nA climate hazard or confluence of hazards cannot be considered a political issue without \ncausing some kind of direct negative impact on a human system, such as a city, a farming \nregion, key node of infrastructure, or referred damage to ecosystems that support them.  The \nkey variables here are: (1) the vulnerability to climate hazard damage of the human systems \nin question, and (2) the level of damage they are likely to sustain.  The human systems most \nvulnerable to climate-related shocks will be those who are already working at capacity, \npoorly managed or constrained by lack of resources.  The most severe impacts will come \nwhen high systemic vulnerability combines with high hazard exposure.   \n \n(3)\u00a0Socio\u00adeconomic\u00a0Consequences\u00a0of\u00a0Hazard\u00a0Impact\u00a0\nAny damage to human systems from climate change hazards will have flow-on socio-\neconomic consequences, the nature and severity of which will depend on the adaptive \ncapacity of the location in question.  The adaptive capacity of human systems describes their \nability to reduce exposure to climate hazards, recover from losses incurred and cope with the \nconsequences of the post-shock environment (Garg and Halsnaes 2007, 19; Gallopin 2006, \n300-1).  The relationship between adaptive capacity and the risk of harmful socio-economic \nconsequences is inversely proportional: risk is a product of the probability of climate hazard \nexposure and its expected consequences, which will vary according to local adaptive capacity \n(Dewar 2003, 3).  Therefore, poorly adaptive human systems have a higher risk of \nexperiencing deleterious consequences as a result of climate change hazards.   \n \nGenerally, regions located within countries with high adaptive capacity will be more resilient \nto external climate shocks.  Such countries share a number of characteristics: first, they have \nadequate economic resources to fund buffering capacities and adaptive responses, along with \nequitable access to maximise public welfare and minimise social disruption.  A prosperous \ncountry is more likely than a poor one to withstand external shocks.  Clearly, wealth provides \noptions in responding to crises and those most able to harness market forces are best disposed \nto cope (Campbell and Parthemore 2008, 14; McKeown 2008, 101).  Second, resilient \n\u00a0 5\nArchived at Flinders University: dspace.flinders.edu.au\ncountries possess appropriate technologies for buffering and response.  Third, such countries \nare able to widely disseminate crisis-relevant information to at-risk groups and employ \nskilled professionals to implement adaptive strategies.  Fourth, they have appropriate \ninfrastructure in place to facilitate rapid reaction.  Finally, a state with high adaptive capacity \nusually has good governance and capable institutions to maintain social stability \n(Munasinghe and Swart 2005, 187).  Countries with low adaptive capacity tend to be \ndeficient in each of these attributes.   \n \nHowever, adaptive capacity is rarely uniform across the breadth of a state, even in states that \npossess all of the attributes listed above.  Because this climate security framework is location-\nspecific, these regional and demographic differences in adaptive capacity within states can be \naccounted for.  Within states, the distribution of capacities often follows home-grown social \nand class cleavages, leaving certain social groups better prepared to absorb shocks than \nothers.  States that discriminate against social groups through violence or denial of \nentitlements tend to marginalise such groups, making them more vulnerable to adverse \noutcomes from environmental stress (Barnett 2007, 8; Schneider et al. 2007,791).   \n \nWhere adaptive capacity is low, climate change hazards are likely to exacerbate problems \nthat already exist, especially if pre-existing human security issues include over-population, \ndemographic imbalance, poor governance, endemic poverty and lack of infrastructure \n(Matthew et al. 2009, 6; Brown et al. 2007, 1148-9).  Ordinarily, these concerns are best \naddressed through appropriate public policy decisions, diplomatic negotiations or other \ncooperative mechanisms, as well as non-government groups, communities, families, and \nindividuals (Brown et al. 2007,1153-4; Schneider et al. 2007, 791).  Conflict scenarios \nmanifest when interventions at all of these levels fail or are non-existent.  The risk of such \noutcomes is greater in poorly adaptive locations than in locations of high adaptive capacity, \nwhere the probability of traditional security threats arising will be minimal. \n \n(4)\u00a0Security\u00a0Implications\u00a0for\u00a0the\u00a0Location\u00a0Under\u00a0Study\u00a0\nThe adaptive responses chosen by governments and the efforts of non-government entities \nwill determine whether adaptation remains in the realm of public policy or deteriorates into \nviolent conflict.  For poorly adaptive states, security is best defined using the human security \nparadigm because conflict is likely to be a product of internal problems catalysed by climate \nchange hazards.  For states with high adaptive capacity, security is still likely to be \nconceptualized through the traditional security lens as problems emanating from other states.  \nTherefore, to properly identify the full spectrum of security issues the framework will \nidentify (1) security threats at the location under study; (2) threats to the state in which the \nlocation under study is based; and (3) threats from the location under study that are exported \nto neighouring states. \n \nCase\u00a0Studies\u00a0\nThree case studies are analysed in this paper to demonstrate the utility of the climate security \nframework: south-eastern Australia, north-eastern China and the Darfur region of Sudan.  \nThey have been selected because they provide an interesting basis for comparison given that \nthey are increasingly being influenced by a similar suite of climate change hazards, most \nnotably decreased annual rainfall.  The root cause of many climate change hazards is the \nimpact of climate change on the Earth\u2019s hydrological cycle, resulting in greater extremes and \nfrequency of heat waves and droughts, as well as floods and storms (Barnett 2007, 1362).  \n\u00a0 6\nArchived at Flinders University: dspace.flinders.edu.au\nEach of the regions analysed in this paper has succumbed to extended periods of drought \nowing to long-term declines in annual rainfall, a trend that is predicted to continue in each \ncase due to climate change.  Yet each case presents different security implications despite the \nsimilar hazard profile, resulting from differences in the hazard vulnerability and adaptive \ncapacities governments and communities.  The case studies show that while the relationship \nbetween environmental degradation and conflict does exist, the relationship is not direct and \nis dependent on a number of other variables.  Using the climate security framework, we can \nidentify the human and traditional security implications that arise in each case. \n \nCase\u00a0Study\u00a01:\u00a0South\u00adeastern\u00a0Australia\u00a0\nClimate\u00a0Hazards\u00a0\nSouth-eastern Australia is a good example of a region where substantial climate-related stress \nhas not resulted in substantial human, environmental and traditional insecurity.  The most \nimportant ecological system within this area is the Murray-Darling river basin, which \nencompasses water systems from Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South \nAustralia, eventually flowing into the Southern Ocean south of Adelaide.  Seventy-five \npercent of Australia\u2019s total irrigated land lies within the basin, which produces more than \nforty percent of the country\u2019s gross agricultural output and consumes approximately seventy \npercent of its irrigation water (Garnaut 2008, 129).  Much of the basin experiences a \nMediterranean-type climate with hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters, punctuated by \nperiodic droughts that occur within the natural cycle of climate variability.  Climate change is \npredicted to increase annual average temperatures, leading to decreases in rainfall and \nincreasingly intense and frequent drought events, a trend that is already visible throughout the \nbasin.  Between 1910 to 2004, the average maximum temperature in Australia rose 0.6\u00b0C, \nwhich the IPCC predicts will continue to rise into the future, with south-eastern Australia \nsuffering up to twenty percent more droughts by 2030 (Hennessy et al. 2007, 511; Lucas et \nal. 2007, 1).   \n \nBy definition, a drought is a prolonged period of abnormally dry weather where lack of \nprecipitation causes extreme hydrological imbalance in an affected area, creating deficiencies \nin surface and groundwater resources (Mpelasoka et al. 2008, 1283-7).3  In South-eastern \nAustralia episodes of drought are thought to correlate with El Ni\u00f1o events driven by the El \nNi\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Pacific Ocean-wide climate system driven by \nvariations in water temperature and ocean currents.  As climate change is predicted to \nincrease the amplitude of ENSO, drought events in south-eastern Australia are predicted to \nbecome more frequent and intense, thus increasing the exposure of human systems within this \nregion to ravages of drought (Lenton et al. 2008, 1790).  The altered hydrological regime will \nreduce stream flows through the river system and reduce soil moisture is surrounding land \nareas.  The risk of bushfire will also increase as region dries out.  The number of \u2018very high\u2019 \nand \u2018extreme\u2019 fire danger days could increase by between 4 - 25 percent by 2020 and 15 - 70 \npercent by 2050 (Lucas et al. 2007,1, 39).  The Black Saturday bushfires beginning on 7 \nFebruary 2009 starkly illustrated the impact of bushfires on human systems, in which entire \ntownships were destroyed, farmland lain waste and important infrastructure was disabled.   \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n3 There is a significant time lag between prolonged precipitation shortfall and the onset of a hydrological \ndrought, as groundwater reserves and surface water bodies may contain enough water to maintain ecological \nsystems and human activities during the period rainfall deficit.  This also means that hydrological drought can \ncontinue well beyond the period of rainfall deficit, creating damage impacts well after precipitation levels have \nstabilized. \n\u00a0 7\nArchived at Flinders University: dspace.flinders.edu.au\n Impact\u00a0on\u00a0Human\u00a0Systems\u00a0\nWater scarcity will in turn accelerate land degradation as drought-effected areas lose soil \nmoisture.  In agricultural regions, drought-related reductions in evapo-transpiration will \nincrease the risk of soil moisture moving below the root zone of crops, leading to problems \nsuch as soil acidification, dry land salinity and water logging (when rain does fall) (Hennessy \net al. 2007, 518).  Poor quality soils diminish the productivity return of fertilizers and reduce \nthe health crops, leaving them vulnerable to pests and disease (Bi and Parton 2008, 2-3).  The \npastoral industry will be affected by reductions in the quantity and quality of available \npastureland (Garnaut 2008, 129).  As this process accelerates, changes in land use will occur \nas farming on marginal land in drier regions becomes unsustainable.  Where agriculture \npersists, rising temperatures, water scarcity, land degradation and periodic bushfires are likely \nto combine to reduce crop yields, causing fluctuations in both the supply and price of \nproduce.   \n \nThe impact of decreased average rainfall on human systems in the Murray-Darling basin will \nbecome more severe as water supply and consumption trends converge (Mpelasoka et al. \n2008, 1283-4).  Water diverted from the basin for human usage has far exceeded the \nreplenishment capacity of the system, increasing with the expansion of agriculture and urban \nsettlements that are dependent on the basin for water.  Over-allocation of water rights and \ninefficient water usage has combined with increasing demand, driven by population growth \nand development, to place considerable stress on supply capacity.  The IPCC predicts that \nannual stream flow in the basin will fall within the range of 10-25 percent by 2050, and 16-48 \npercent by 2100 (Hennessy et al. 2007, 512, 517).4  Because water allocation is already \nstretched beyond capacity, many water users within the system will not be able to tolerate \nfurther degradation of water supply.  If the drying trend continues into the future as predicted, \nthe number of water users acutely vulnerable to water stress will increase, along with \ncompetition for water rights among agricultural, industrial and urban users.  This will also \nexacerbate the tension between human usage and the environmental flows required to \nmaintain the health of the river system (CSIRO 2008, 5).   \n \nSocio\u2010Economic\u00a0Consequences\u00a0\nAs a developed country, Australia is fortunate to have excellent adaptive capabilities.  It \nenjoys a high level of economic development by global standards, an educated population, \nstable government and well-resourced institutions, which augur well for high-quality climate \nhazard responses.  The rapid and decisive responses of national and state governments to \ndisaster events including the Black Saturday bushfires in February 2009 and Cyclone Larry in \nMarch 2006 are evidence of this.  Governments are attempting to manage water demand in \nrural areas though water license buy-backs and expansion of water trading markets, as well as \naugmenting water supplies in capital cities through recycling, storm water catchment and \ndesalination (Hennessy et al. 2007, 525).  This adaptation effort could be improved by the \nexpansion of linkages between the local, state and federal strata of government, which as \nrelics of Australia\u2019s federal system of government remain weak.  Decision-making and policy \nimplementation is often dissipated across a range of institutions and special-interest sectors, \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n4 The IPCC predicts a 50% chance that the average salinity of the lower Murray River will exceed the 800 EC \nthreshold set for desirable drinking and irrigation water by 2020 (Hennessy et al. 2007, 517).  \n\u00a0 8\nArchived at Flinders University: dspace.flinders.edu.au\nwhich inhibits the creation of sufficient impetus for confronting the more difficult adaptation \nchallenges (Behm 2009, 10). \n \nThere are segments of Australian society that are more vulnerable than others.  Rural \nAustralians are more vulnerable to climate change hazards because of unequal access to \nhealth care nodes, which are for the most part located in capital cities and a few large \npopulation centres (Bi and Parton 2008, 3).  In such communities in south-eastern Australia, \neconomic hardship (unemployment, bankruptcy, farm foreclosures) brought on by ongoing \ndrought has led to increased rates of suicide, particularly among young men, a problem \nexacerbated by a scarcity of mental health services in these communities.  Indigenous \nAustralians are also at greater risk from exposure to climate change hazards as a result of \nendemic economic disadvantage and poor access to health services and employment \n(Hennessy et al. 2007, 522). \n \nThe economic impacts for drought-affected communities in south-eastern Australia, which \nare already considerable, are likely to worsen into the future.  There is a high probability that \nirrigated agricultural production in the Murray-Darling basin will decline as a result of \nclimate change-driven water shortages (Garnaut 2008, 126).5  Rural communities within the \nbasin are likely to contract as agricultural production declines, leading to rising \nunemployment and migration of residents to larger population centres in search of work.  \nDamage from extreme events such as bushfires is also likely to be substantial, placing an \neconomic burden on government for reconstruction efforts (Hennessy et al. 2007, 509).  \nHealth care costs are also predicted to increase with a rise in the number of heat-related \ndeaths in large population centres predicted to double by 2020 and triple by 2050 (Hennessy \net al. 2007, 524). \n \nPolitical\u00a0&\u00a0Security\u00a0Implications\u00a0\nThe security challenges posed by exposure to climate change hazards in South-eastern \nAustralia are likely to be quite benign by international standards, posing little threat of \ndomestic conflict or destabilisation for neighbouring states.  The biggest problem in the near \nterm is likely to be migration away from rural communities as unemployment rises and \nregional economies struggle under the weight of agricultural downturn.  Nevertheless, \nbecause the rate and scale of population displacement is not likely to be large, any problems \nassociated with the resettlement of internal migrants in larger population centres should be \nmanageable. \n \nIn terms of traditional security concerns, the military is likely to be deployed more often in \nresponse to more frequent and severe disaster events, as it was in the wake of the Black \nSaturday bushfires in February 2009.  Deployment of the Australian Defence Force (ADF) in \nresponse to homegrown disaster events, as well as interventions in Indonesia, East Timor and \nthe Solomon Islands has given it substantial experience in responding to disaster events \neffectively.  Should such deployments be required more often in the future, a greater \nproportion of the ADF\u2019s budget will be devoted to domestic disaster response instead of \nnational security and could reduced its capacity to meet external security demands (Behm \n2009, 8); (Bergin and Townsend 2007, 2). \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n5 The Garnaut Climate Change Review has predicted that irrigated agricultural production in sections of the \nMurray-Darling basin in New South Wales will decline by up to 92 percent, wheat production in Victoria by 25 \npercent, as well as a 33 percent fall in livestock productivity in South Australia. \n\u00a0 9\nArchived at Flinders University: dspace.flinders.edu.au\n\u00a0Case\u00a0Study\u00a02:\u00a0Northern\u00a0China\u00a0\nClimate\u00a0Hazards\u00a0\nThe impact of drought on north-eastern China will lead to a different set of security \noutcomes, based on the geographic, political and economic characteristics of that region.  The \nmunicipalities of Beijing and Tianjin, two of China\u2019s largest cities, are located within this \narea.  The region lies near the boundary between temperate and semi-arid climate zones, \nwhich are dominated by continental polar air masses for much of the year.  Rainfall occurs \npredominantly in the summer as a result of the East Asian monsoon, though annual \nprecipitation rates can vary widely (Chen 2005, 369).  This area has experienced a consistent \nincrease in average temperature over the last half-century, bringing with it decreasing annual \nrainfall (Xu et al. 2006, 85).  The IPCC predicts more frequent and persistent droughts as the \nwarming trend continues (Cruz et al. 2007, 475). \n \nImpact\u00a0on\u00a0Human\u00a0Systems\u00a0\nNorth-eastern China is vulnerable to drought and water scarcity because of a geographic \nmismatch between water resources and areas of high population and development.  A large \nmajority of China\u2019s water reserves are located in the south of the country, in the sub-tropical \nclimate zone where precipitation is abundant.  North-eastern China accounts for over forty-\nfive percent of China\u2019s population, contains almost half of the country\u2019s agricultural land and \nproduces a third of its GDP, but has only nineteen percent of its water resources (Jiang 2009, \n5).  Rising average temperatures are predicted to depress crop yields, with grain crops \nparticularly susceptible to climate variations.  A 3-4o Celsius rise in temperature above 1990 \nlevels is likely to reduce maize and rice production in East Asia by 10-20 percent by 2100 \n(Cruz et al. 2007, 483).  The direct impact on the temperature tolerance of crops is \ncompounded by changes to precipitation patterns, length of the growing season, the intensity \nand timing of extreme weather events, and increased exposure to plant pests, weeds and \ndiseases.  Also, the agriculture-pasture land transition that signifies a climate zone boundary \nis pushed southward, decreasing the stock of arable farmland and leaving new grassland areas \nvulnerable to desertification in combination with human-induced degradation (Chen 2005, \n371).     \n \nRiver basins are by definition water-stressed if per capita water availability falls below the \ninternationally accepted standard of 1,000 m3 per year.  In north-eastern China, for example, \nannual per capita water availability in the Hai River basin stood at 470 m3, due to a \ncombination of climate-related constraints on supply as well as unsustainable demand cause \nby over-consumption.6  Water demand has increased by approximately eight percent since \n1997 and is projected to rise by 20 percent by 2030 (Bates et al. 2008, 8; Cai 2008, 14-6).  \nAlready, up to 90 percent of stream flows in the basin are diverted for human use, well above \nthe figure of 30-40 percent stream flow diversion that is the safe limit for maintenance of \nhealthy aquatic ecosystems (Jiang 2009, 3; Kendy et al. 2003, 2).  Because of this major \nimbalance between demand and supply, irrigation from surface and ground water reserves in \nthe region are projected to meet only 70 percent of water requirements for agricultural \nproduction (Bates et al. 2008, 88).  As development has advanced, groundwater reserves have \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n6 The Hai River (Haihe) basin incorporates water systems in Hebei Province that drain from the east in Shanzi \nand south in Henan into the Bohai Gulf near Tianjin. \n\u00a0 10\nArchived at Flinders University: dspace.flinders.edu.au\nbeen mined voraciously, leading to land subsidence as aquifers are depleted, while forest and \ngrassland replaced by farm land and industrial development projects have decreased the water \nstorage capacity of the soil and thus exacerbating flooding events (Cai 2008,15; Economy \n2007, 42).7  Moreover, the advance of urban and industrial development has led to the \npollution of water sources, with 78 percent of monitored water courses in the Hai River basin \nrecording a quality so poor that they could not support any human use (Jiang 2009, 3-4). \n\u00a0\nSocio\u2010Economic\u00a0Consequences\u00a0\nThe adaptive responses of government institutions and communities in north-eastern China \nwill be shaped by a number of factors.  Huge losses in agricultural production and industrial \noutput have been recorded as a result of water shortages.  Approximately 25-30 million tons \nof food production and about 200 billion RMB (~US$ 29 billion) in industrial output is lost \nannually (Cai 2008, 20).  Attempts are underway to reduce surface and groundwater \nconsumption by placing restrictions on land use, though often regulations are poorly enforced \nor simply ignored (Cai 2008, 18).  The heavy-lifting of China's government institutions \noccurs at the provincial and county levels, which exert considerable autonomy from the \ncentral bureaucracy in Beijing.  Local officials rarely enforce Beijing's environmental \nmandates if they conflict with projects that advance economic growth and by extension \nenrich the local officials themselves (Economy 2007, 39).  This results in poor water resource \nmanagement across China\u2019s patchwork of government institutions, characterised by \nineffective inter-agency coordination at different levels of government that hinders the \nimplementation of any local-level adaptation measures (Jiang 2009, 6).   \n \nBecause bureaucratic coordination is so difficult, the central government\u2019s responses to water \nscarcity have often centred on grand geo-engineering projects to boost supply, which are \neasier to establish because they do not offend any important political constituencies by \nconstraining water consumption.  The best current example of this practice is the south-north \nwater transfer project, which will bring water via pipeline form the Yangtze River to supply \nurban and industrial centres in the Hai River basin (Schiller 2008-2009, 124).  Like any geo-\nengineering project of this magnitude, the cost of supplying water to end users will increase \nalong with the distance or depth that water must be piped or pumped from its original source \n(Bates et al. 2008, 70). \n \nThe other demand-side obstacle is the long-running failure of the Chinese government to \nprice water, which encourages free riding and gives water users no economic incentives to \nconserve water and prevent waste (Schiller 2008-2009, 124).  The government has trialled \nwater trading markets in several locations and is working on a bolder national scheme, \nthough this has yet to be implemented (Liu 2008).  Farmers will be most affected by water \npricing; as their economic position is already marginal, being forced to pay for water will \nlikely destroy their livelihoods (Cai 2008, 20-2; Kendy et al. 2003, 28).  Climate-related \nwater scarcity will make it difficult for the Chinese government to allocate water without \nwithdrawing water entitlements from other users. \n \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n7 In the Haihe basin, the cities of Beijing and Tianjin have both experienced land subsidence of approximately \nsix feet over the past decade. \n\u00a0 11\nArchived at Flinders University: dspace.flinders.edu.au\nPolitical\u00a0&\u00a0Security\u00a0Implications\u00a0\nThe combination of water scarcity and inequitable access to water resources is rapidly \nbecoming a source of political disquiet in north-eastern China.  Water use conflicts cut across \nmany axes, illustrated by competition between upstream and downstream users, as well as \nsectoral competition between agricultural, industrial and urban water consumers.  It is the \nrole of the Chinese government to adjudicate between competing claims and allocate water in \na fair and equitable manner, allowing scarcity stress to be borne equally by all users (Cai \n2008, 15).  Yet as has been shown above, access to water is highly unequal, causing \nconsiderable public unhappiness with the central government, culminating in an alarming rise \nin social unrest linked to water and environmental grievances in recent years.  Often this has \nresulted when local level officials have catered to entrepreneurial interests by allowing over-\nextraction and pollution, while shutting down all channels for public grievance.  Pent-up \ngrievances have exploded into violent anger-venting riots, numbering as many as 1,000 a \nweek across China (Yu 2008, 75-6; Economy 2007, 47). \n \nThe proliferation of widespread social unrest related to water allocation and environmental \nissues represents a serious challenge to the Chinese government's nation-building strategy of \nmaintaining social harmony through economic development, which could undermine the \nauthority of the Communist Party (Economy 2007, 46).  The Beijing government has \nincreasingly viewed this kind of social unrest as a security threat, to which it has often \nresponded by violent crackdown.  However, by framing environmental complaints through \nthe mindset of security, the government is closing off opportunities for dialogue, the \ndevelopment of transparency and institutional reform, which would improve the water \nallocation process and help to prevent major protests over water issues from erupting (Ma \n2008-2009, 33).  By taking a hard line, the government is ensuring that the underlying \nproblem of water scarcity will get worse and lead to more of the very protests that it is \nattempting to suppress.  \n \nThe wider trend of aridity and desertification in north-eastern China is also likely to \nencourage people to flee unviable rural communities, with up to fifty million people predicted \nto be internally displaced China-wide by 2010.  These people often move to cities such as \nBeijing and Tianjin where their presence adds to pressure on water resources and \ninfrastructure (Schiller 2008-2009, 123; Cruz et al. 2007, 488).  The fear of climate-related \nmigration also extends to neighbouring states.  Officials in Russia have long feared a mass \nmigration of Chinese into the Russian Far East, leading to Sinification of the region and its \neconomic, demographic and military incorporation into China's sphere of influence (Alexseev \nand Hofstetter 2006, 1; Menon and Ziegler 2002, 36).  Russia controls 30 percent of the \nworld's fresh water resources, mostly in places east of the Ural Mountains such as Lake \nBaikal.  Many planners in Moscow fear that these resources could become a target of \npredation for water-stressed China as the effects of climate change exacerbate its water \nscarcity (Muraviev 2009). \n \nWater scarcity is likely to impact on China's ability to produce sufficient food for its large \nand growing population.  In the event of widespread food insecurity within China, demand in \nChina for food imports will divert food supplies from other countries and may drive up global \ncost of food, pricing vulnerable poor people in other countries out of the market (Jiang 2009, \n1; New Agriculturalist 2002).  This will in turn have serious impacts on the human security of \nvulnerable citizens in other net food-importing countries, leading to social unrest and \npossibly malnutrition in extreme cases.  In effect, China would be exporting the social and \npolitical problems of water scarcity and food insecurity to other more vulnerable nations. \n\u00a0 12\nArchived at Flinders University: dspace.flinders.edu.au\n Case\u00a0Study\u00a03:\u00a0Darfur\u00a0\nClimate\u00a0Hazards\u00a0\n \nOf the three case studies, the Darfur example exhibits the most tangible human, \nenvironmental and traditional security concerns stemming from the combination of \nenvironmental degradation and societal factors.  The Darfur region itself is roughly the size \nof France and because of its size, it occupies four different climatic zones, grading northward \nfrom rich savanna in the south, through poor savanna, an arid zone and finally desert in the \nnorth.  Annual rainfall ranges from 400-800 milimetres per year in the savanna zone to zero \nannual rainfall in the desert zone (Fadul 2004, 34).  Darfur has suffered from numerous long \ndroughts over the past half-century due to a long-term warming trend that has seen the desert \nclimate zone shift southward up to 200 kilometres since records were first kept in the 1930s.  \nThe IPCC predicts that declining annual precipitation rates will see climates zone boundaries \ncontinue to migrate southward, placing the region's pastoral grasslands and agricultural areas \nin the savannah at risk of desertification (Boko et al. 2007, 439). \n \nImpact\u00a0on\u00a0Human\u00a0Systems\u00a0\nAgriculture is the main economic activity for more than eighty percent of Darfur's \npopulation, essential for the food supply and economic well-being of the population.  Millet \nand sorghum are the staple crops for most of Darfur's population, the productivity of which is \nwholly dependent on rainfall and the natural fertility of the soil (Fadul 2004, 36).  Because of \nthis, local food systems and economies are particularly vulnerable to changes in the regional \nclimate regime.  Food production is predicted to fall by approximately 20 percent due to \nendemic drought caused by changes to the regional climate system (UNEP 2007, 7).   \n \nDarfur\u2019s ethnic and cultural heterogeneity is itself heavily influenced by climate zone \nboundaries, which shape the lifestyles and socio-economic organisation of the groups within \neach zone.  In the arid north, Arab and non-Arab groups such as the Zayyadiyya, Northern \nRizayqat\u2019 and Irayqat exist as camel nomads.  Non-Arab sedentary farmers such as the Fur, \nMasalit, Tama, Qimr, Mima occupy the central area of Darfur, while the south is populated \nby a series of Arab-speaking cattle nomad groups including the Baqqara, the Bani Halba, \nHabbaniyya, Rizayqat and Taaisha (O\u2019Fahey 2004, 24).  Each of these groups perceive \nthemselves as quite distinct and have developed elaborate ideologies of ethnicity around this \ndifferentiation (Murphey 2008, 243).   \n \nCreeping desertification from the north and persistent drought throughout Darfur are pushing \nthese groups together as traditional lands become unviable, forcing them to compete over \nscarce resources in remaining viable areas.  Population growth and density in Darfur has \naccelerated rapidly over the last fifty years, exacerbating the problems that arise as climatic \nconditions force diverse ethnic groups into close geographic proximity (Fadul 2004, 35).  In \nthe sedentary agricultural areas this has led to pressure for greater food production and \nincreased demand for wood fuel for brick making, contributing to land degradation through \nover-cultivation of soils and removal of vegetation cover, as well as increased exploitation of \nwater resources (Boko et al. 2007, 441-2; Al Mangouri 2004, 46).  In pastoral areas, \npopulation pressure and drought have led grazing nomads to maximise the size of livestock \n\u00a0 13\nArchived at Flinders University: dspace.flinders.edu.au\nherds.  The increased animal population has itself led to the degradation of grazing lands, \naccelerating the pace of desertification in these areas (UNEP 2007, 7-8; Fadul 2004, 38). \n \nSocio\u2010Economic\u00a0Consequences\u00a0\nThe political situation in Darfur and Sudan as a whole is a major constraint on the adaptive \ncapacity of communities in the region.  The Sudanese state has a limited institutional capacity \nbecause of protracted civil warfare and the tangled web of inter-communal conflict that \npermeates political relations throughout the country.  Because government institutions have \nnot facilitated human security in Darfur, ethnic groups have come to rely on communal \ninstitutions to maintain well-being, resolve conflict and defend against attack from rival \ngroups.  Not surprisingly in the context of extreme land and resource competition, relations \nbetween local communities have been characterised by distrust and a predisposition toward \nviolence.  Local communities do have mechanisms to create crosscutting ties to help mitigate \ninter-communal conflict (Mohamed 2004, 68-70).8  However, these piecemeal measures have \nproven insufficient to overcome the deep ecological and political problems that drive inter-\ncommunal fighting. \n \nLocal communities are beginning to adopt practical measures to adapt to environmental \ndegradation and climatic stress.  Adaptation measures include water harvesting and efficient \nirrigation techniques; expanded food storage facilities to buffer against poor harvests; \nimproved rangeland management to reduce over-grazing; livestock substitution (replacing \nheavy-grazing goats with sheep, which have less impact on grassland); establishment and \nmaintenance of tree line shelter belts to protect against wind-driven soil erosion; backyard \ngardens to supplement family food supplies; and education and training to help communities \nmaintain these interventions (Osman-Elasha 2009, 92).  If successfully implemented, they \nwill increase community resiliency and reduce the need for groups to engage in coping \nstrategies that lead to violence and further degrade the environmental capacity of their \nsurrounds. \n \nUnfortunately, however, community adaptation remains trapped in the cycle of competition \nand conflict.   The decreased productivity of rain-fed crops has forced farmers to compensate \nfor declining output by expanding the land area under cultivation.  Expansion of plot sizes \nhas occurred at the same time as substantial population growth, leading to the expansion of \nfarms from cropland into the pasturelands used by nomad groups to graze livestock.  It was \ninevitable that in the absence of state institutions, the issue of land use and distribution would \nlead to conflict between farmers and nomads, as well as between farmers themselves, who \nwere all competing for a slice of a diminishing productive land base (Salih 2008, 3; \n(Mohamed 2004, 68). \n \nPolitical\u00a0&\u00a0Security\u00a0Implications\u00a0\nClimate stress and resource scarcity has been the context within which contemporary \nviolence in Darfur has taken place.  However, the situation in Darfur is itself nested in the \npolitics of the two decades-long civil war between the central government in Khartoum and \nthe Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) that ended in January 2005 (UNEP 2007, 4).  \nDuring the mid-1980s Sudanese Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi took the strategic decision to \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n8 Such mechanisms include the Sufi Order (Tariqa), the Quranic school (khalwa), mediation (judiyya), tribal \nfestivals, inter-marriage, exchange of gifts, and naming children after friends from other groups. \n\u00a0 14\nArchived at Flinders University: dspace.flinders.edu.au\narm the Baqqara people of southern Darfur ostensibly to defend themselves from the SPLA.  \nHowever, in the midst of a crippling drought, the newly armed Baqqara took the opportunity \nto instead attack their northern neighbours, the Fur and Masalit peoples.  The SPLA \nresponded to the central government's attempt to open a southern front in the war by \nsupporting the first Arab tribal militias, or murahaleen, who subsequently began attacks on \nnon-Arab groups in central Darfur (Murphey 2008, 233, 255).9  After the peace agreement \nwas signed to end the civil war in January 2005, the central government co-opted the \njanjawid, whom they used to maintain control over Darfur against a rebellion nationalist \ngroups (O\u2019Fahey 2004, 26-7; Salih 2008, 9).  The coalescence of ethnic groups in limited \ngeographic proximity due to drought and the southward march of desertification has provided \nfertile conditions for the perpetuation of inter-communal violence. \n \nBecause of its long history of war, Sudan has the largest population of internally displaced \npersons in the world at over five million people.  Internal displacement in Darfur constitutes a \nlarge proportion of this figure, with over 2.4 million people affected since 2003.  Of these \npeople, about one third have congregated in large refugee camps where their existence is one \nof constant insecurity, punctuated by human rights abuses and conflict over food and water \n(UNEP 2007, 6).  Many refugee camps have also become bases for members of rebel groups \nfighting against the central government and the janjawid.  Because of this, janjawid militias \nattack any refugees who stray outside of the camps and regularly harass the camps \nthemselves (Kahn 2008, 15).  The remaining two-thirds of the displaced population live in \nsmaller camps and share land and resources with nearby towns and villages, while some live \nwithin towns and villages with the local population (Kahn 2008, 11).   Because of the scale of \npeople movements, the complexity of ongoing warfare and the particular vulnerability of the \nwater-scarce landscape of Darfur, the human suffering involved have had few parallels in the \nworld today.   \n \nThe refugee problem has spilled over into neighbouring Chad, where refugee camps on both \nsides of the Chad-Sudan border have become bases for parties fighting in Chad's civil war.  \nApproximatley 230,000 thousand refugees from Darfur are currently housed in camps in \nChad, which serve as rear bases for recruitment and cross-border incursions deeper into Chad \nitself (Kahn 2008, 11, 15).  In response, the government of Chad has launched its own \nmilitary raids into Sudan on the pretext of chasing Chadian rebels.  In one incident, the \nChadian army clashed with Sudanese military forces inside the Sudanese border, a skirmish \nwhich left 17 Sudanese personnel killed (Salih 2008, 17).   \n \nThe international community has focused on military responses to the Darfur conflict.  The \nUnited Nations has proclaimed the need to send a peacekeeping force to Darfur, though none \nhas been deployed due to conflicting interests within the UN Security Council based on \nChina's energy partnership with the Khartoum government and the relationship of the United \nStates with the SPLA, arrayed in competition over Sudan's oil reserves (Salih 2008, 15-6).  A \nsmall African Union peace-keeping force of up to 7,000 personnel has been operating in \nDarfur since 2004.  Its impact has been minimal due to its small size, lack of logistical \nsupport and limited mandate, along with suspicions in Khartoum over the role of the United \nStates in supporting the African Union intervention (Salih 2008, 13-4).  Given the vast size of \nthe Darfur region however, it seems impossible that any international force, regardless of its \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n9 It is often said that the janjawid militias that have terrorized Darfur since 2003 were a remnant of the \nmurahaleen, however, this is not quite true, as the janjawid were predominantly recruited from the rival \nRizayqat group and other hostile clans. \n\u00a0 15\nArchived at Flinders University: dspace.flinders.edu.au\nsize, could provide effective physical security in such a complex political environment (Kahn \n2008, 13).   \n \nConclusion\u00a0\nThe three case studies considered here illustrate how similar climate change hazards can lead \nto a very different suite of human, environmental and traditional security implications, \ndepending on the economic and political conditions in each location.  In south-eastern \nAustralia, high exposure to drought has increased water scarcity and heightened potentiality \nfor more intense bushfires.  Because governments and communities have high adaptive \ncapacity and the level of pre-existing socio-economic problems is relatively low, the security \nimplications of climate hazard exposure are relatively minor for both individuals and the \nstate, in spite of continued over-extraction of water resources.  In north-eastern China, \nexposure to similar drought hazards is having a more pronounced effect due to extreme \nimbalance between water demand and supply, limited institutional capacity and social \nmarked inequality.  For vulnerable individuals, climate-driven environmental degradation is \nincreasingly heightening their economic insecurity and harming their health.  The Chinese \ngovernment is concerned that the insecurity felt by vulnerable citizens will generate internal \nmigration to already stressed urban centres and translate into social unrest which could \ndelegitimise Communist Party rule.  In Darfur, climate-driven drought and desertification has \ncombined with ethnic cleavages, non-existent institutional capacity and endemic inter-group \nconflict to produce extraordinary pressures toward continued inter-communal violence and \nhigh levels of population displacement.  This in turn exacerbates the cycle of environmental \ndegradation and conflict within Darfur and creates flow-on problems for neighbouring states \nand the international community.   \n \nThe link between climate change and security is a complicated one.  Using the four-step \nclimate security framework, the three competing security paradigms can be reconciled; they \nare not mutually exclusive, as the former is often a precursor to the latter.  This paper has \nemployed the climate security framework comparatively in order to demonstrate its validity.  \nIn future studies however, the framework should be utilised to analyse individual locations to \ndetermine security risks for all climate change hazards affecting the region under study.  \nNonetheless, the relationship between climate change and security can thus be summarised in \nthis way: the more extreme the pre-existing political and socio-economic problems, the more \npronounced would be the effect that climate-driven environmental degradation will have on a \ngiven location. \n \n \n\u00a0 16\nArchived at Flinders University: dspace.flinders.edu.au\nReference\u00a0List\u00a0\n\u00a0\n(2002). \u2018Country profile: China.\u2019 New Agriculturalist.

    "abstract": "Despite climate change being identified as a current or future risk for organizations, researchers have yet to understand employees\u2019 perceptions of their workplaces\u2019 preparedness for climate change-related natural hazards (cc hazards) such as floods and wildfires. The purpose of this preliminary study is to describe the current state of workplace preparedness for cc hazards and to ascertain whether workplace preparedness for cc hazards aligns with state hazard priorities for cc hazards. Using data collected in 2014 from an online, national survey of 2,008 employees in the United States, the results indicate that workplaces are moderately prepared for cc hazards. In addition, there is a slight mismatch between workplace preparedness and state preparedness priorities for cc hazards. This study contributes to the literature on organizational preparedness for cc hazards by providing insights on the current state of workplace preparedness\u2014from the perspectives of employees\u2014for natural hazards associated with the global threat known as climate change. The paper concludes with a policy recommendation and provides an outline for future research on organizational preparedness for cc hazards",

Sadiq, Meredith Ollier, Jenna TylerIntroduction In recent years, scholars and policymakers have expressed a mounting concern over the impacts of natural hazards related to the global threat of climate change (O\u2019Brien, O\u2019Keefe, Rose, & Wisner, 2006). Such hazards, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2012a), include, but are not limited to heat waves, droughts, floods, and wildfires. These climate change-related hazards (hereinafter referred to as cc hazards) have not only become more severe and frequent in recent decades, but are projected to continue to increase in severity, frequency, spatial extent, and duration in years to come (IPCC, 2012a, 2013). In light of this prediction, human systems, including societies, organizations, and individuals have been encouraged to adapt to future climatic changes to limit physical and economic losses (Adger, Arnell, & Tompkins, 2005). Although adaptation, in the purview of climate change, broadly refers to adjustments made by human systems in response to the adverse impacts from climatic events (Adger, Arnell, & Tompkins, 2005; IPCC, 2007), this study seeks to empirically examine the extent to which workplaces have adapted to cc hazards by describing employees\u2019 perceptions regarding their organizations\u2019 preparedness for cc hazards.  Preparedness involves actions undertaken by organizations in readiness for an emergency or disaster such as obtaining a first aid kit or extra medical supplies, providing employees with information on where to meet after disasters, and offering disaster preparedness and response training programs for employees (Sadiq & Graham, 2015). Understanding the degree to which workplaces are prepared for cc hazards is important given that individuals and organizations have historically viewed the concept of climate change as nebulous and ambiguous (Berkhout, Hertin, & Gann, 2006), and there is a lack of certainty about the type, severity, or time of onset of cc hazards (Winn et al., 2011). 1 Consequently, organizations may not adequately prepare for the physical impacts of climate change albeit the direct effects of climate change can have lasting and devastating consequences. Such direct effects include, but are not limited to, physical damage to facilities, economic losses, higher operating costs, and disruptions in operations (Center for Climate and Energy Solutions (C2ES), 2013). However, when workplaces prepare for the adverse impacts of cc hazards, these direct effects can be minimized thus allowing workplaces to maintain their production and continue to contribute to the general and economic wellbeing of their community (Burns & Slovic, 2012).  Considering the potential for significant losses and forecasts suggesting increases in the frequency and intensity of cc hazards (IPCC, 2012a, 2013), it is clear that there needs to be a better understanding of what workplaces have done to alter their exposure and vulnerability to cc hazards. To contribute to this limited research, we study employees\u2019 perceptions of their workplaces\u2019 preparedness levels and examine two research questions. (1) \u201cAre workplaces prepared for cc hazards?\u201d By exploring this question, we hope to acquire a broader understanding of workplace preparedness for cc hazards whereby the findings will serve as the groundwork for future studies. Then, we seek to understand if employees\u2019 perceptions of workplaces preparedness for cc hazards parallel with state preparedness priorities. Thus, our 1 Because organizational preparedness is operationalized as perceived preparedness level at the facility where employees report to work, we use the terms organization and workplace interchangeably.Page 1 of 16 Risk, Hazards & Crisis in Public Policy_________________________________________________________________________________ This is the author's manuscript of the article published in final edited form as: Sadiq, A.-A. A., Ollier, M., & Tyler, J. (2016). Employees\u2019 Perceptions of Workplace Preparedness for Climate Change-Related Natural Hazards. Risk, Hazards & Crisis in Public Policy, 7(2), 62\u201378. http://doi.org/10.1002/rhc3.120952  second research question is: (2) \u201cDoes workplace preparedness for cc hazards align with state hazard priorities for cc hazards?\u201d An inquiry to this question is important as it will reveal if workplaces are effectively utilizing their resources to prepare for the cc hazards that state emergency management agencies deem are most peculiar to their community. Together, this study ultimately seeks to bring familiarity to how organizations are effectively preparing for an otherwise \u201cblack box\u201d concept\u2014climate change. It is important to note that the goal of this preliminary study is not to test any hypotheses, but to describe what is going on within workplaces in terms of cc preparedness.    Using data collected from a national, online survey of 2,008 employees in the United States, the results suggest a need for workplaces to increase their level of preparedness for cc hazards. The results also highlight the importance of risk communication in helping workplaces better align their preparedness for cc hazards with their states\u2019 preparedness priorities for cc hazards. This preliminary study contributes to the literature on organizational preparedness for cc hazards by providing insights on the current state of workplace preparedness\u2014from the perspectives of employees\u2014for natural hazards associated with climate change. In the following section, we review the three cc hazards of interest\u2014droughts/heatwaves, floods, and wildfires. Then, we discuss the extant literature on climate change adaptation and workplace preparedness. Next, we explain the method of data collection, variable measurement, and discuss the results. Finally, this paper concludes with a policy recommendation and provides an outline for future research on workplace preparedness for cc hazards.    Literature Review   Climate Change-Related Natural Hazards  In this study, we observe three cc hazards\u2014droughts/heat waves, floods, and wildfires. This selection was made for two distinct reasons. First, these three natural hazards have the probability of occurring in all geographical regions in the United States. And second, the IPCC (2012a, 2012b) has recognized that these three natural hazards are associated with climate change (IPCC). This study conforms to the IPCC\u2019s (2012b, p. 557) definition of climate change as \u201cthe climate that can be identified (e.g., by using statistical tests) by changes in the mean and/or the variability of its properties, and that persists for an extended period, typically decades or longer\u201d. We also follow the lead of the IPCC by not distinguishing between anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic climate change (UNFCCC, 2011). This is because, irrespective of the causes of climate change, evidence suggests that the global temperature is increasing. For instance, the decade of 2001-2010 was the warmest decade since global records began in 1850 (IPCC, 2013; World Meteorological Organization (WMO), 2014).  Likewise, 2015 was noted as the warmest year on record (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), 2015). In sum, our goal is not to engage in the debate on the systematic causes of climate change, but to recognize that certain natural hazards are associated with climate change, and these hazards have increased in frequency and severity in recent years.   Drought/Heat Waves  Droughts are prolonged periods of abnormally low rainfall, and heat waves are prolonged periods of unusually hot weather. Droughts and heatwaves are grouped together in this study because heat waves contribute to drought conditions by depleting soil moisture content and Page 2 of 16Risk, Hazards & Crisis in Public Policy3  increasing evaporation, which results in increased surface heating and drying (Hansen, Sato, & Ruedy, 2012). Based upon physical considerations, the intensity and frequency of heat waves and droughts are likely to increase due to higher mean temperatures (Coumou & Rahmstorf, 2012; IPCC, 2013).   Floods  Flooding is the most destructive natural hazard in terms of fatalities, injuries, and economic losses (Jonkman, 2005; Sadiq & Noonan, 2015). While this study did not distinguish between the different types of flooding, forecasts suggest that there will be increases in the frequency, intensity, and quantity of heavy precipitation events. Similarly, the warming of the oceans and thermal expansion, along with the melting of glacier ice, contribute to rising sea levels and it is likely that an increased incidence and/or magnitude of extreme high sea levels will have an impact on human systems, especially along the coast (IPCC, 2013)  Wildfires  Recent years have shown an influx in the frequency and magnitude of wildfire events. In fact, out of the 29 presidentially declared wildfire disasters, 22 have occurred since 2000 (Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), 2016). While climate change is not the sole cause of wildfires, drier soil and vegetation resulting from increased temperatures make areas more prone to wildfires (C2ES, 2011). Heat waves over the United States contributed to the outbreak of wildfires in 2012 (UNISDR, 2013), and the combination of hot temperatures, strong winds, and drought conditions contributed to the worst wildfire in Colorado\u2019s history in 2013 (WMO, 2014). In the Unites States, the length of the fire season has increased by 78 days compared to nearly three decades ago (Westerling et al., 2006), and the frequency and size of wildfires has substantially risen (C2ES, 2011).  Climate Change Adaptation   The concept of climate change adaptation has been given increased attention over the past decade (Gerber, 2014). According to the IPCC (2007), adaptation refers to \u201cadjustments in natural or human systems in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli or their effects\u2026\u201d Stemming from this definition, social scientists have used the concept of adaptation to understand human systems\u2019 perceptions and adjustments to natural hazards (Burton, Kates, & White, 1978; Smit & Wandel, 2006). Adaptation can then be viewed in a variety of different forms. For example, adaptation can be viewed as anticipatory or reactive whereby the former refers to human systems taking into account future trends and proactively employing measures to limit losses prior to the event (Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), 2012; Smit & Wandel, 2006; Van Aalst, Cannon, & Burton, 2008), and the latter focuses on making changes following a significant climatic event (Klein, 2003). Adaptation is also viewed as planned or autonomous (EPA, 2012). While planned adaptation refers to a deliberate policy decision that is based on conditions suggesting that action is required to limit any future losses, autonomous adaptation refers to human systems acting in their own self-interest to take actions in response to changing conditions regardless of any policy (Klein, 2003). Understanding the extent to which human systems have proactively and autonomously been successful in reducing the impacts of climate change is of great importance to both scholars and policymakers (Klein, 2003). Page 3 of 16 Risk, Hazards & Crisis in Public Policy4   According to Adger, Arnell, and Tompkins (2005), successful adaptation is contingent upon human systems\u2019 ability to reduce their sensitivity, alter their exposure, and increase their resiliency to climate change. Actions taken to reduce human systems\u2019 sensitivity to climate change include making changes to infrastructures through building codes and zoning. Altering a systems\u2019 exposure to climate change is achieved by investing in preparedness measures and developing disaster plans (Adger, Arnell, & Tompkins, 2005; Smit & Wandel, 2006). Finally, adaptation actions are intended to promote the resilience of human systems despite a changing climate (Gerber, 2014). Resilience, according to Tierney (2013), refers to a system\u2019s ability to resist, absorb, and bounce back from adverse natural hazard events. Ultimately, adaptation activities are designed to enhance the ability of human systems to adjust and adapt to the negative impacts engendered by climate change-related natural disasters.   Organizational Preparedness  While the ongoing discussion has focused on human systems in general, we now turn to organizations in particular as the goal of the present study is to understand the extent to which workplaces are prepared for cc hazards through the perceptions of their employees. Organizations are critical entities in any society; they provide goods and services to community members and contribute to the economic and general wellbeing of the community they serve (Sadiq & Graham, 2015). Yet, when confronted by cc hazards, organizations can suffer considerable damage to facilities, economic losses, higher operating costs, and disruptions in operations (IPCC, 2012b; Schulte & Chun, 2009; Winn et al., 2011). To minimize these negative effects, organizations are encouraged to invest in preparedness measures. However, the decision to act can be difficult as there is uncertainty about the type, severity, or time of onset of cc hazards (Winn et al., 2011). Consequently, organizations may perceive climate change and its impacts as ambiguous, far-reaching, and unpredictable (Berkhout, Hertin, & Gann, 2006; Winn et al., 2011). This is evidenced by Brody et al. (2010) study of 1,528 agency personnel from local and regional public sector organizations. Specifically, this study sought to understand the extent to which public sector organizations incorporated climate change-related mitigation and adaptation strategies in their planning and policymaking activities. The results showed that in general, public sector organizations do not view climate change as an immediate threat requiring action. Similar arguments have been made by Lorenzoni et al. (2006) and Sterman and Sweeney (2007) who both suggest that the public does not view climate change as an immediate and high priority threat. However, there is scientific evidence suggesting that cc hazards have become more severe and frequent in recent decades, and as a result, it is imperative for organizations to adapt to future climatic changes by investing in preparedness (Adger, Arnell, & Tompkins, 2005; Berkhout, Herlin, & Gann, 2006; IPCC, 2013).  Data and Methodology   Data Collection   One of the authors was part of the research team that developed the survey instrument and administered it through GfK. GfK is one of the largest global survey research organizations and has approval from the National Institute of Health to conduct survey research. The instrument collected the following information, among others, from respondents: their perceptions of their Page 4 of 16Risk, Hazards & Crisis in Public Policy5  employers\u2019 level of preparedness for different natural hazards; employee demographics; and characteristics of employees\u2019 organization. A pre-test of the survey instrument was conducted with a test group consisting of 17 staff and alumni of a university in Midwestern United States from December 12 to December 20, 2013. The minor issues that were revealed during the pre-test were corrected. After making these corrections, the survey was shared with GfK for an initial pilot of 100 individuals in their KnowledgePanel\u00ae (more information on GfK\u2019s KnowledgePanel\u00ae is available at http://join.knpanel.com/about.html). The KnowledgePanel\u00ae is based on a representative random sample of the United States population. Members of the KnowledgePanel\u00ae are recruited using random-digit dialing and address-based sampling methods that include both households with and without Internet access. If the sampling selects households that have neither an Internet connection nor a computer, GfK provides both to them at no charge. As a result, the KnowledgePanel\u00ae provides a nearly complete coverage of the United States population. Compared to random digit dialing and non-probability Internet surveys, probability-based Internet panels yield more accurate results (Chang & Krosnick, 2009). In addition, the American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) issued a report on online panels that stated studies using nonprobability sampling methods are generally less accurate than studies using probability sampling methods in cases where it is possible to compare survey results to external benchmarks like the Census (Baker et al., 2010). Conversely, Yeager and colleagues (2010) argue that there is no significant difference between non-probability and probability samples with regard to accuracy but conclude that probability samples provide a more accurate measurement of the distribution of variables within a population. GfK fielded the online survey in May 2014 to a national sample of 10,559 United States adults, 18 years of age or older from their KnowledgePanel\u00ae. GfK sent one reminder to encourage participation. Of the 10,559 sample members invited to participate, 5,079 responded, and were then screened based on two eligibility criteria: 1) currently working as a paid employee for an employer other than themselves, and 2) not currently telecommuting for the majority of their work time. The authors are interested in measuring employees\u2019 perceptions of their employers\u2019 preparedness and not the perceptions of owners of workplaces. Also, the authors surveyed respondents that do not telecommute for the majority of their work time because the authors wanted respondents that are aware of the preparedness measures present at the facility where they report to work.  A total of 2,026 respondents passed the eligibility screening and completed the survey (the screening procedure eliminated 2,702 because they were not currently working and 351 because of telecommuting). After about four weeks, the survey was completed, and the data were given to the research team. The response rate for this survey is 48 percent, using the guidelines established by the AAPOR (www.aapor.org/Standard_Definitions2.htm#.U9fLRvldU1c). AAPOR\u2019s Response Rate 3 (RR3) was used, and calculated by dividing the 2,008 interviews by the sum of 2,026 known eligible cases plus 2,192 estimated eligible cases among the 5,480 who did not respond to the survey invitations (assuming an estimated eligibility rate of 40%, based on the eligibility rate of the 5,079 respondents). GfK weighted the data to account for unequal probabilities of selection as well as to ensure that the data are as close as possible to Current Population Survey (CPS) estimates for the United States population vis-\u00e0-vis demographic characteristics (see Table 1).  The final sample size is 2,008 respondents after 18 (0.8 percent) cases were removed due to short completion times of less than five minutes. A common technique in survey research is to Page 5 of 16 Risk, Hazards & Crisis in Public Policy6  use completion time to identify respondents who may have sped through the survey without carefully reading or answering questions (Olson & Parkhurst, 2013). A review of the 18 cases showed that respondents either failed to answer items after the initial demographic section, or exhibited \u2018straight-lining\u2019 (answering several sequential items with the same response).  Although the current research design was built upon two smaller studies, the data collected in the present survey is distinct in two respects. First, to the best of the authors\u2019 knowledge, the data used in this study is the largest survey to date measuring workplace preparedness for cc hazards. Second, this is one of a few known surveys that gathered information anonymously from a national sample of employees about their employer\u2019s level of preparedness. Surveying employees instead of the leaders of organizations is somewhat novel and may allow us to avoid two problems. First, sampling organizational leaders is likely to result in low response rates. For example, the response rate for surveying organizational leaders in Sadiq and Weible\u2019s (2010) and Han and Nigg\u2019s (2011) studies were 31 percent (N=227) and 33.6 percent (N=933), respectively. Second, there is a potential for biased responses from the leaders of organizations as leaders have an incentive to overstate their organizations\u2019 preparedness levels (Fowler, Kling, & Larson, 2007; Larson & Fowler, 2009). A variant of response bias is selection bias, whereby leaders of organizations that have adopted some preparedness measures may be more likely to respond to the survey than leaders of organizations that have not adopted any preparedness measure. By sampling employees, the authors hope to mitigate these two problems and get a more accurate picture of the level of organizational preparedness for cc hazards.  Variable Measurement and Data Analysis  The data analysis component comprised of two separate levels of analyses\u2014national and state. The national-level analyses used all the observations in the sample, while the state-level analyses were restricted to state subsamples. The national-level analyses give a broad perspective, whereas the state-level analyses provide a more nuanced understanding of the regional differences in workplace preparedness for cc hazards. The national level data are used to answer the first research question: \u201cAre workplaces prepared for cc hazards?\u201d As a result, the variable of interest, employee perceptions of workplace preparedness was measured by the following question on the survey: \u201cOn a scale of 1 (not prepared at all) to 5 (very prepared), please rate your perception of your employer\u2019s level of preparedness for [drought/extreme heat, flooding, and wildfires] at the facility where you report to work.\u201d A new variable was created, average preparedness for cc hazards by adding responses to the three cc hazards together and dividing the total by three. Information about which state an employee reports to work was measured by the question: \u201cIn which state do you report to work?\u201d  The state subsample data and secondary data from state hazard mitigation plans are used to answer the second question: \u201cDoes workplace preparedness for cc hazards align with state hazard priorities for cc hazards?\u201d To answer this question, we identified four states, each representing one of the four census regions in the United States\u2014California, West; New York, East; Ohio, Midwest; and Texas, South. These four states were selected because each had the highest number of observations within their respective regions in the sample. After the selection, the authors visited the respective state emergency agencies\u2019 websites and obtained the latest copy of the states\u2019 hazard mitigation plan. Each hazard mitigation plan contained a ranking of hazards from most likely to least likely to occur within their state\u2019s jurisdiction. These rankings guide state hazard preparedness priorities. Specifically, rankings were based on: probability and Page 6 of 16Risk, Hazards & Crisis in Public Policy7  stress/impact (State of California); HAZNY risk analysis methodology (State of New York); total risk (State of Ohio); predetermined rankings (State of Texas). Other natural hazards were rated in each state hazard mitigation plan. However, because our three hazards of interest are droughts/extreme heat, floods, and wildfires, we ranked these three hazards in consecutive order. For example, if a state hazard mitigation plan ranks four hazards in the following order: flood (1), earthquake (2), drought/heat (3), and wildfire (4), we eliminated earthquake and re-ranked the three remaining hazards in the following order: flood (1), drought/heat (2), and wildfires (3).  Results  Table 1 compares respondents\u2019 demographics for the weighted and unweighted samples to the CPS. The CPS data reported in Table 1 is for adult civilian workers that are 18 years and older. It is important to note that the CPS has no data on household heads (the CPS collected data on \u201chouseholder\u201d, which is a slightly different concept) or one-family house detached. Lastly, the CPS has information on income over $100,000. 2According to Table 1, the average age of the respondents in the sample was about 42 years old, nearly 70 percent were white, and 22 percent hold a Bachelor\u2019s degree. With regard to gender, 53 percent were male, and 80 percent were household heads, and the average household size was about three people. Further, 67 percent live in a one-family house, 14 percent make between $100,000 and $124,999 in income, and 52 percent are married. Finally, 85 percent reside in a metro area, 72 percent own their living quarters, and 86 percent have Internet access.  Table 1.

Respondents from New York, Ohio, and Texas represent about seven percent, four percent, and six percent, respectively. Descriptive statistics for national preparedness levels, presented in Table 3, show that the cc hazard with the highest mean preparedness level is drought/extreme heat (3.32), followed by flooding (2.99), then wildfire (2.50). The overall average for all cc hazards is 2.93.   Table 2. State Subsample Statistics  State, region of the US N Mean Std. Dev. Min. Max.

In New York, the natural hazard with the highest mean preparedness is flooding (3.03), followed by drought/extreme heat (3.01) and wildfires (2.16). Drought/extreme heat has the highest mean preparedness in Ohio (3.23). The second and third positions are occupied by flooding (2.81) and wildfires (2.08), respectively.

In addition, Texas has the highest average mean preparedness for cc hazards (3.11) followed by California (3.06), New York (2.73), and Ohio (2.71).   Table 4. Mean Preparedness for cc Hazards for all Four States   One possible explanation for the moderate\u2014and in some cases, less than moderate\u2014levels of workplace preparedness for all cc hazards observed in the four states may be due to the varying levels of priority given to these natural hazards by each state. To investigate this possibility, the authors examined the hazard mitigation plans of the four states to see which of these three cc hazards were identified as primary concerns for the states. The authors then ranked the identified cc hazards based on their estimated risk values by the four states. Table 5 presents information about how the cc hazards were ranked by the four states\u2019 hazard mitigation plans. It is important to note that all the states identified the three cc hazards as priorities.   Table 5. Natural Hazard Ranking by State Hazard Mitigation Plans   Table 6 presents a comparison of the state cc hazard rankings and the mean preparedness rankings (based on mean preparedness values) by employees. State hazard rankings are in the left columns under state EM plan headings, while employee rankings are in right columns under survey headings. Two observations are worth mentioning. First, the State of California and the State of New York are the only states where priorities for cc hazards align perfectly with workplace preparedness rankings. Second, the state hazard rankings matched the mean  Mean Preparedness  California New York Ohio Texas CC Hazards     Drought/Extreme Heat 3.37 3.01 3.23 3.61 Flooding 2.77 3.03 2.81 2.99 Wildfires 3.03 2.16 2.08 2.72 Average 3.06 2.73 2.71 3.11  Rank CC Hazards California New York Ohio Texas 1  Drought/Extreme Heat (both were ranked 1 and 2, respectively) Flooding-coastal, inland, ice-jams Flood-areal and riverine, flash flood, and seiche Flood 2 Wildfires Drought Drought Wildfires 3 Flooding Wildfire Fire-forest, range, urban, and wildland Drought Source California Governor\u2019s office of Emergency Service (2014) New York State Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management (2014) Ohio Emergency Management Agency (2014) Texas Division of Emergency Management (2013) Page 9 of 16 Risk, Hazards & Crisis in Public Policy10  preparedness rankings in 6 out of 12 total cases. In sum, state priorities for cc hazards align with workplace preparedness rankings in just half of the cases.    Table 6. Comparison of State Hazard Rankings with Employee Preparedness Rankings for cc Hazards    Discussion  At the national level, the results indicate that employees perceive their workplaces to be moderately prepared for cc hazards. The national-level results are corroborated by the results of the sub-analyses from the States of California, New York, Ohio, and Texas. In general, employees in all four states have moderate\u2014and in some cases, less than moderate\u2014workplace preparedness perception levels for the three cc hazards despite these cc hazards been identified as major environmental threats within their respective state hazard mitigation plans. The national and state level results support previous research that maintained that the public does not view climate change as an immediate and a high priority threat (Brody et al., 2010; Lorenzoni et al., 2006; Sterman & Sweeney, 2007), as well as descriptions of climate change by researchers as a distant threat (Lorenzoni et al., 2006), a threat with a long response delay (Sterman & Sweeney, 2007), an uncertain environmental threat (O\u2019Connor, Bord, & Fisher, 1999), and a predictable surprise (Bazerman, 2006).   The findings of this study also have practical implications for risk communication as the results indicated that organizations in the states of Ohio and Texas (and perhaps other states not considered in this study) are not preparing for the hazards that their respective state emergency management agencies have prioritized for their states. In fact, employees in both Ohio and Texas revealed that their workplaces are more prepared for droughts/heat waves than floods albeit flooding has a higher risk level than droughts/heat according to their respective state emergency management agencies. As a result, it is possible that organizations may not be getting the necessary preparedness information from their state emergency management agencies about cc hazards. It may also be the case that their state emergency management agencies may not be as effective in their means of sharing hazard related information compared to California and New York. Interestingly, employees in California, Ohio, and Texas reported that their organizations are most prepared for droughts/heat waves. This could potentially be attributed to the fact that organizations might view preparing for a drought/heat wave to be more affordable than preparing for a flood or wildfire. In fact, studies have found that individuals typically invest in less complicated and less expensive preparedness measures (Webb et al., 2000).

It requires organizations to understand and assess the risk of multiple natural hazards against the backdrop of uncertainty (Birkmann, 2011). Projections from cc hazard assessments and impact scenarios, like the IPCC assessment reports, help inform organizations of anticipated impacts. However, these hypothetical assessments present a challenge for organizations because they are ambiguous and indirectly related to organizations (Berkhout, Hertin, & Gann, 2006). To make matters worse, there are limitations on organizational preparedness including financial, technical, (Sadiq & Weible, 2010), cognitive, structural, and political constraints (Bazerman, 2006). Furthermore, the contradiction of beliefs and opinions of the public and the schisms between the public and the scientific community about climate change may hinder the adoption of preparedness measures for cc hazards. However, awareness of the physical impacts of climate change on organizations can ameliorate this issue. Just as public opinion influences government policies (Sterman & Sweeney, 2007), it can create a solid foundation for implementing organizational preparedness policies for cc hazards (Yu et al., 2013).  With climate change impacts on organizations expected to increase, organizations need to increase their level of preparedness for cc hazards, especially those examined in this study, and have been identified as major priorities by the four states\u2019 emergency management offices. In order for organizations to invest in preparedness, they need to first understand the risks and associated impacts of cc hazards. In fact, organizational awareness of the physical risks and potential impacts is the first step in managing risk from cc hazards (C2ES, 2013). Thus, an understanding of perceived organizational preparedness for cc hazards is also necessary for future recommendations regarding organizational investment in preparedness measures for cc hazards.  The following two limitations provide opportunities for researchers to improve this study. First, employees may not be aware of the preparedness measures implemented by their workplaces. Nonetheless, by asking employees about the level of preparedness at the facility they report to work, and by making sure that employees are present at those facilities for a majority of their work time, the authors may have been unable to reduce the potential bias stemming from ignorance. Second, this study used perceived organizational preparedness, not actual preparedness measures adopted by organizations, as measures of preparedness. Although the latter may result in more accurate measures of organizational preparedness than the former, the use of perceptual measures is prevalent among scholars (e.g., Brody et al., 2008; Fowler, Kling, & Larson, 2007; Poussin et al., 2014; Chikoto, Sadiq, & Fordyce, 2013; Sadiq, 2011; Sadiq & Weible, 2010). Despite raising more questions than answers, this study provides the basis for future organizational preparedness research on climate change-related natural hazards. For example, future studies might inquire into the reasons for the low levels of workplace preparedness and why state natural hazard rankings are not better aligned with workplace preparedness rankings for the states of Ohio and Texas. Finally, future studies should replicate our study using all the 50 states. In so doing, researchers, policymakers, and practitioners will have a more comprehensive understanding of workplace preparedness, and a better understanding of the relationship between workplace preparedness rankings and state cc hazard priorities.   Conclusions  Page 11 of 16 Risk, Hazards & Crisis in Public Policy12  This preliminary study contributes to the literature on organizational preparedness for cc hazards in two ways. First, the current study describes the current state of workplace preparedness\u2014from the perspectives of employees\u2014for natural hazards associated with the global threat known as climate change. Second, this study illuminates the connection between natural hazards and climate change. Organizations must be aware of the physical impacts of climate change in order to adapt. However, studies have shown that the concept of climate change is nebulous and ambiguous for individuals and organizations (Berkhout, Hertin, & Gann, 2006). Studying natural hazards related to climate change might bring familiarity to an otherwise \u201cblack box\u201d concept\u2014climate change. Consequently, the findings regarding workplace preparedness for climate change-related natural hazards may offer insights into how organizations are preparing for climate change. In sum, if the IPCC reports (IPCC, 2012a; IPCC, 2012b) are anything to go by, the low workplace preparedness levels as well as the mismatch between two state natural hazard preparedness priorities and mean preparedness rankings suggest that more needs to be done to prepare workplaces for the impacts of climate change. The mismatches between state preparedness priorities for cc hazards and employees\u2019 preparedness rankings for the States of Ohio and Texas, present an opportunity for a policy recommendation. The state governments of Ohio and Texas (and perhaps, other states that may be experiencing the same problem) should implement risk communication programs aimed at disseminating information about natural hazard priorities to organizations. A risk communication program might consist of community awareness campaigns regarding the cc hazards most peculiar to a particular community and the preparedness measures needed by organizations to reduce the impacts from those hazards. In doing so, state governments can improve the alignment between their state\u2019s preparedness priorities and organizational preparedness for climate change-related natural hazards, thus enhancing organizational resilience to climate change.  Although, this preliminary study is descriptive in nature, it helps to lay the foundation for future research. Moreover, our study represents the first piece of the puzzle in assessing organizational preparedness for cc hazards. More research is needed on other puzzle pieces such as the future research topics discussed above. Once all these puzzle pieces are put together, organizational decision-makers, policymakers, and the public will have a better and more comprehensive understanding of organizational preparedness for climate change-related natural hazards.

While \nsome climate plans included actions for shoreline erosion, coastal inundation, and storm \nsurges, only one addressed sea level rise impacts on buildings and heritage (i.e. Redland).  \n \n \nIntroduction \n \n \nClimate change adaptation and mitigation is now a key issue for local governments, \nespecially coastal councils (Nursey-Bray, 2010; Vasey-Ellis, 2009). In Queensland, climate \nchange impacts on coastal areas include the effects of tropical cyclones, storm surges, \nflooding, sea level rise (SLR), tidal inundation, and shoreline erosion. Recent news articles \nhighlight planning issues, building codes, insurance risk, and the cost of impacts on coastal \nareas from tropical cyclones (Bita, 2011), state-wide flooding during summer 2010/2011 \n(The Courier Mail, 2011; Williams & Bita, 2011), and SLR impacts on Queensland\u2019s coast \n(Abel et al, 2011; Collins, 2011; Houghton, 2011; PIA, 2011; Williams, 2011). A projected \nSLR of 1.1m by 2100 will affect low-lying infrastructure and buildings in LGAs of coastal \nQueensland, mainly Brisbane, Gold Coast, Moreton Bay, Fraser Coast, Mackay, and \nTownsville (DCCEE, 2011a). The Local Government Association of Queensland established \na Coastal Councils Adaptation Taskforce (C-CAT) in early 2011 to address this risk, with 16 \ncoastal councils now members. There is also a Queensland representative on the National \nCoasts and Climate Change Council, the mayor of Bundaberg. The new Queensland \nCoastal Plan requires councils to prepare coastal hazard adaptation plans for those parts of \ntheir urban areas at risk, related to a projected SLR of 80cm by 2100, with related guidelines \nfor coastal management, protection and hazards (DERM, 2011). The growing impacts of \ncoastal development, climate change and sea level rise are key issues in Southeast \nQueensland (Abel et al., 2011; Dedekorkut et. al., 2010; Wang et al., 2010). Moreover, \n\u2018...ongoing coastal development and population growth in areas such as Cairns and South \nEast Queensland...are projected to exacerbate risks from sea level rise and increases in the \nseverity and frequency of storms and coastal flooding by 2050\u2019 (IPPC, 2007, cited in SCC, \n2010, p. 13). Councils applying for state government grants for new infrastructure projects \nmust address adaptation to minimise climate impacts (DIP, 2010). In planning for climate \nchange, councils thus need to promote adaptive capacity which is \u2018the ability of built, natural, \nand human systems to accommodate changes in climate (including climate variability and \nclimate extremes) with minimal potential damage or cost\u2019 (SCC, 2010, p. 56). Council \nplanning for Queensland coastal areas focuses on hazards and risk management, with new \nplanning guidelines to assess risks to communities and a three to five year phase in of \ncoastal hazard plans to allow councils time to prepare adaptation strategies (DERM, 2011). \n \n \nQueensland coastal councils \n \n \nThere are 35 coastal councils in Queensland, covering half (47%) of all councils in the state. \nIn total, there are 73 councils across Queensland (city, regional, shire, & Aboriginal shire); \nwith a separate Weipa Town Authority managing this mining town on Cape York Peninsula. \nThe coastal councils comprise four city councils (i.e. Brisbane, Gold Coast, Redland, & \nTownsville); 14 regional councils (i.e. Bundaberg, Cairns, Cassowary Coast, Fraser Coast, \nGladstone, Gympie, Isaac, Mackay, Moreton Bay, Northern Peninsula Area, Rockhampton, \nSunshine Coast, Torres Strait Island, & Whitsunday); eight shire councils (i.e.  Aurukun, \nBurdekin, Burke, Carpentaria, Cook, Hinchinbrook, Mornington, & Torres); and nine \nAboriginal shire councils (i.e. Hope Vale, Kowanyama, Lockhart River, Mapoon, Napranum, \nPalm Island, Porpmuraaw, Wujal Wujal, & Yarrabah). The coastal shire and Aboriginal shire \ncouncils are all located in North Queensland, Cape York and around the Gulf of Carpentaria.  \nThis paper focuses on coastal councils in South East Queensland, and the Cairns council. \n \n \nClimate change impacts on Queensland coastal areas \n \n \nSome 85% of Queensland\u2019s population lives on or near coastal areas, with 73% of \nQueensland\u2019s coastline comprising open sandy beaches (DERM, 2011). The coastal local \ngovernment areas in South East Queensland (SEQ) are among the top ten areas at risk of \ninundation from flooding, sea level rise (SLR) and storm surges (Dedekorkut et al., 2010), \nwith 245,000 people at risk of SLR impacts by 2030 (Wang et al., 2010). Over 70% of \ncommercial buildings in SEQ are located within 5km of the shoreline; with the SEQ Regional \nPlan 2009-2031 allowing for 502,000 more houses along the SEQ coast by 2031. Climate \nchange impacts on Queensland\u2019s coastal areas include:  more severe tropical cyclones (e.g. \nCyclone Yasi, 2011 and Cyclone Larry, 2006); storm surges; flooding; sea level rise; coastal \ninundation (high tide/king tide/storm tide); beach/dune erosion; shoreline recession; and \nestuary instability. These climate impacts affect beaches, dunes and shorelines and cause \ndamage to coastal buildings, roads, electricity, ports, airports, schools, hospitals, industrial \nsites, landfills, recreation areas, water and sewerage plants; and emergency facilities. The \nclimate change impacts on coastal infrastructure from SLR and storm events include: \nstructural damage and fatigue; accelerated degradation of foundations and materials; \nincreased ground movement; groundwater changes; and flooding (DCCEE, 2009).  \n \nIn coastal Queensland, up to 4,700km of roads, 570km of railways and 1,400 commercial \nbuildings are at risk from SLR of 1.1m by 2100 (DCCEE, 2011a) (Table 1). Key Queensland \nairports are also located in vulnerable low-lying coastal areas prone to flooding, such as \nBrisbane, Cairns, and Coolangatta on the Gold Coast. With  0.8m SLR by 2100, the \nQueensland Coastal Plan states 94,000 buildings will be partially inundated (with 10,650 \nbuildings in Brisbane); while 65,000 properties will be affected by storm surge inundation. In \nSEQ, almost 9,000 homes are within 110m of erodible shoreline; 32,500 homes are exposed \nto a 2.5m storm tide; with 61,500 homes at risk from storm tides by 2030 (DERM, 2011). \nQueensland has the highest number of at risk residential buildings in Australia\u2019s coastal \nzone located within 55m (n=5,400) or 100m (n=15,200) of \u2018soft\u2019 coastlines. Between 48,300 \nand 67,700 houses, worth $15 to $20 billion, are at risk from SLR of 1.1m by 2100 (DCCEE, \n2011b). Despite this high level of exposure and vulnerability to climate change impacts in \nQueensland (Bajracharya, Childs & Hastings, 2011), few coastal councils have completed a \nclimate change risk assessment (i.e. Moreton Bay, Redland) or climate change plan. \n \n \nTable 1.

The actions in these plans are analysed for their adaptive response \ncategories: Emphasising Nature, Emphasising Development and Managed Nature (Vasey-\nEllis, 2009), along with Council Governance of climate change, and Emphasising \nCommunities. The adaptation options in coastal planning include: Relocate and prevent \ndevelopment or unsustainable land use, Designate protected land, Create setback buffers, \nCreate wetlands and revegetate vulnerable areas (Emphasising Nature); Private insurance \nfor vulnerable properties, Developers accept full risk, Elevate buildings and change building \ncodes, Build hard structures (Emphasising Development); and Beach nourishment, Build \nartificial reefs (Managed Nature) (Vasey-Ellis, 2009). The climate actions stated in climate \nchange strategies for Cairns, Gold Coast, Redland, Sunshine Coast, and Bribie Island are \nanalysed according to which main adaptation response category they best fit.  \n \nThe category, Emphasising Nature, focuses on protecting the environment (e.g. beaches, \ndunes, habitat, park land, plants, waterways, and wildlife) to buffer the effects of climate \nchange on nature and also to protect developed areas from climate hazards. The category, \nEmphasising Development, focuses on protecting the built environment through insurance, \nbuilding codes and engineering responses to limit damage to council, public and private \nproperty (i.e. assets, infrastructure, hazards, and risk). Managed Nature refers to \u2018natural\u2019 \nengineering options such as replacing beach sand by pumping or trucks. Emphasising \nCommunity refers to public access, consultation, engagement, health risks, or safety issues \nin regard to climate impacts. Council Governance refers to internal council processes for \ndealing with climate change issues through frameworks, leadership, policy, strategies, staff \ntraining, and reports. Climate impacts affect both communities and councils. Climate change \nplanning and infrastructure responses by Queensland coastal councils mainly focus on \nprotecting coastal development from erosion and other climate hazards, and building \ncommunity resilience, supplemented by environmental actions protecting nature as a buffer.  \n \n \nClimate change strategies by Queensland coastal councils \n \n \nOnly five Queensland coastal councils have prepared climate change strategies or action \nplans, including Brisbane (BCC, 2007), Cairns (CRC, 2009, 2010), Gold Coast (GCCC, \n2010), Redland (RCC, 2010), and Sunshine Coast (SCC, 2010). These climate change \nplans cover the main urban centres in SEQ and the far north Queensland coast, with these \nlarger coastal councils also leaders in the Cities for Climate Protection program (Table 2). A \nclimate change plan was in progress for Moreton Bay Regional Council, between Brisbane \nand the Sunshine Coast, with actions approved by council members in September 2011 for \nthis plan. The Bribie Island community in the Moreton Bay council area has already \ndeveloped their own climate adaptation plan with SEQ Catchments (Chapman, 2010). Three \nSEQ coastal councils have also prepared shoreline erosion management plans, a coastal \ndune policy, and beach nourishment programs for key beaches (Table 2). Only one inland \nQueensland council, the Southern Downs, had a climate change adaptation action plan.  \n \n \nTable 2.

Adaptation strategies in the plan were \namending the City Plan to reduce exposure to flooding and storm surges, and disaster \nmanagement planning. The adaptation actions all related to risk management measures:  \n\u2018Funding adaptation measures such as relocation of buildings and infrastructure from high \nrisk areas as necessary\u2019 (Action 3c); \u2018Upgrade the Q100 flood level; Enhanced stormwater \nand flood-related infrastructure requirements\u2019 (Action 13a); \u2018Require forward planning for \nCouncil assets, especially water supply, wastewater treatment plants, stormwater, roads and \nbridges\u2019 (Action 22a); \u2018Establish flooding and storm surge response plans\u2019 (Action 23a); and \n\u2018Understanding sea level rise and storm surge impacts on Brisbane\u2019 (Action 30a). Only two \nadaptation actions addressed coastal impacts in this Brisbane climate action plan. State \nplanning policies on flooding still don\u2019t consider SLR or storm surge impacts (PIA, 2011). \nThis paper now reviews adaptive actions in climate change strategies by four other urban \ncoastal councils, Cairns, Gold Coast, Redland, and Sunshine Coast, and for Bribie Island.  \n \nThe climate action plans for Bribie Island, Cairns, Gold Coast, Redland, and Sunshine Coast \nincluded strategies for climate change mitigation and adaptation, environmental protection \nand building community resilience to climate change (Table 3). Specific actions for \nadaptation were included in the strategies for Sunshine Coast (n=25) and Cairns (n=9). The \nSunshine Coast adaptation actions were further divided between Objective 5: Identify and \nplan for climate change risks (n=14), and Objective 6: Adapt to the impacts of climate \nchange (n=11). The climate strategies for Bribie Island, Gold Coast and Redland included a \nmix of both mitigation and adaptation actions in key areas, including the natural environment \n(i.e. biodiversity, shoreline, & water), planning and infrastructure (Bribie, Gold Coast) or \ndevelopment and council assets/services plus community safety and resilience (Redland). \nThe Cairns strategy had a \u2018transition\u2019 section with nine actions about community resilience. \nSpecific actions for council governance and leadership on climate change responses were \nincluded in strategies for Cairns, the Gold Coast, and Sunshine Coast. The Bribie Island plan \nincluded sections with community concerns about shoreline and emergency management. \nOther climate actions for mitigation and/or energy use in the Cairns, Redland and Sunshine \nCoast climate change strategies were not included in this analysis of adaptation responses. \n \n \nTable 3.

These included the three adaptation \nresponse categories employed by Vasey-Ellis (2009) to assess Victorian coastal planning: \nemphasising development, emphasising nature and managed nature, along with two other \nresponse categories, council governance and emphasising community, added by the author. \nThis analysis highlighted the varied responses to climate adaptation actions by councils \n(Table 4). The Cairns, Sunshine Coast, and Gold Coast strategies focused on council \ngovernance to implement climate actions, along with actions emphasising nature to protect \nthe environment, assets, and public areas. Emphasising nature was the main adaptation \nresponse in the community plan for Bribie Island (n=52, 73%), and council plan for Redland \n(n=48, 49%), by protecting the environment and facilities from adverse climate effects. \nEmphasising community was the second adaptation response category in the strategies for \nRedland, Bribie Island, and Cairns, with actions focused on community resilience and safety \nfrom climate hazards. There were only two actions for the response category, managed \nnature, with an artificial reef (Bribie Island) and controlling vegetation for fire management \n(Redland). The beach nourishment and sand replenishment at beaches on the Gold Coast, \nSunshine Coast and in Cairns (see Table 2) were not mentioned as actions. Climate actions \nin the four council plans focused on protecting council, public and private property in at-risk \ncoastal areas, along with mitigations actions to reduce council and community emissions, \nand insurance for council assets. This is due to the high level of coastal development and \npopulation growth in both SEQ and in Cairns, and council liability to reduce risk from climate \nimpacts through planning and adaptation. Overall, in these five climate plans, the total \nactions by adaptation response categories were: emphasising nature (45.8%), council \ngovernance (25.3%), emphasising community (20.2%), and emphasising development \n(8.2%). The council plans had a key focus on governance actions (33% vs. 0 in Bribie plan). \n \n \nTable 4.

The climate plan for Redland City included actions for sea \nlevel rise impacts and coastal inundation of beaches and foreshores (Table 5), to protect \nnatural and built environments. Planning options, legislation, and costs were all considered \nfor Redland assets and areas vulnerable to inundation by storm tide, flooding or sea level \nrise. Some 22 actions (out of 98) addressed coastal climate change impacts on Redland \ncouncil assets and infrastructure including landfills; beaches/foreshores; and public open \nspace. These coastal adaptation actions were for storm tides/surges/water (n=14), sea level \nrise (n=9), and coastal inundation (n=9). Coastal wetlands were listed as soft infrastructure.  \nTable 5.

Responses included vulnerability and hazard mapping of major risk areas due to \nclimate change along with coastal erosion and inundation impacts in coastal management. \nThere was only one coastal adaptation action (of 15) in this strategy, \u2018Develop a coastal \nmanagement strategy with shoreline erosion management plans where appropriate\u2019 (SCC, \n2010, p. 51). Storm surges are eroding popular Sunshine Coast beaches such as at Noosa. \nCoastal adaption actions in the Bribie Island plan also relate to shoreline management (n=9) \ndue to erosion of beaches on both sides of the island. The actions address community \ninvolvement in preparing a shoreline erosion management plan, and other \u2018soft\u2019 options such \nas groundcover on dunes, protecting mangroves, education about dunes as a wave buffer, \nan artificial reef to protect beaches, and reducing impacts from boat wash and propellers. \nClimate planning needs to protect coastal ecosystems as a vital climate buffer and defence. \n \n \nConclusions \n \n \nThis paper reviewed adaptation actions in climate change strategies by four Queensland \ncoastal councils, Cairns, Gold Coast, Redland, and Sunshine Coast, and for Bribie Island. \nThe climate change strategies for Cairns, Gold Coast, and the Sunshine Coast mainly \nfocused on council governance of climate actions, while adaptive actions emphasising \nnature were the main focus of the Bribie and Redland plans. The adaptive actions by the \nfour urban coastal councils focused on emphasising nature (37%), council governance \n(33%), emphasising community (20%), and emphasising development (8%). Emphasising \nnature (64%) was also the main adaptive response of Victorian coastal councils (Vasey-Ellis, \n2009). Queensland coastal councils adopted a mix of adaptive strategies similar to Victoria, \nbut coastal climate hazards and actions were only considered in the Redland (n=22), and \nBribie Island (n=9) plans. In Queensland, there is less protection of coastal ecosystems and \nliability laws favour developers with a lower priority for nature-based adaptation options and \ngrowing pressure for built defences to protect valuable coastal assets (Abel et al., 2011).  \nReferences \nAbel, N., Gorddard, R., Harman, B., Leitch, A., Langridge, J., Ryan, A. & Heyenga, S.  \n (2011).
