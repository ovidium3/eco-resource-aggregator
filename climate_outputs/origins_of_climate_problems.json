Analysis, based on solely carbon dioxide emission and energy budget, concludes a set of concrete solutions for mitigating climate change effects. Some of the theses violate more orthodox policy which is thus protested against in order to move forward.\u2022  Our long-term goal must be to stop using all carbon-containing fuels, including natural gas and other fossil products as well as biofuels.\u2022  We must electrify society and industry, with electricity from only non-carbon-based power including nuclear power, hydro-electric, wind and solar power.\u2022  We must prepare ourselves for changes. Even if the present emission volumes of carbon dioxide were possible to stop immediately, various lag effects are inevitable and negative development will therefore continue for considerable time.\u2022  We must count with continued melting of land ice, the complete liquifying of the Antarctica ice expected to lead to a global sea level rise by some 60 m, flooding most capitals. Among various solutions to mitigate the effects of ice melting, including lowered global temperatures, the following is proposed.\u2022  To mitigate sea level rise, stationary water reservoirs should be built around the world. With estimated melting rates it would require ca 1 million reservoirs be deployed or expanded during the next 20\u201340 years.\u2022  Such reservoirs could also solve the emergent problem of lack of fresh water in many places. They could also be used for local storage of hydroelectric energy by using pump storage hydroelectric (PSH) technology.\u2022  All energy production sources should be analyzed according to a Total Balanced Energy Budget (TBEB) with the main objective of minimizing the emissions of greenhouse gases.\u2022  For each region/country, a table of available or conceivable complementary electric energy sources should be made and ranked according to TBEB\u2014the sources given priority weights depending on feasibility, significance, and environmental friendliness. Tables are presented for Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Germany, France, Ukraine, California, Massachusetts, Maine, Peru, Australia, China and Japan. Generally, we find the following rank of priority applicable.\u2022  Solar energy from desert arid areas is given highest priority in replacing carbon-based forms of energy. Submarine electric cables may be deployed along the Australia-Singapore model, if the available power grids are insufficient for the energy transport.\u2022  Electrolysis of water producing clean hydrogen gas is given very high priority both for using hydrogen as fuel as well as for energy storage. Improved efficiency should be achieved by the development of electrolysis catalysts.\u2022  Hydroelectric power in combination with PSH is given high priority to mitigate both grid power fluctuations as well as source (solar and wind) intermittence.\u2022  False hope should not be seeded among society and politicians by inflating projects that are less realistic or suboptimal for technological, economic or other reasons.

As a matter of fact, there is no consensus about the priority of pos-sible actions for getting a complete and satisfactory solution!While organizations like IPCC and UNFCCC deal in detail with the origin and consequences of the problem they do not offer solutions4,5. As long as no reasonable and unified action plan is agreed upon, there is, understandably, often a politi-cal reluctancy to make serious efforts. Several (some of them quite populistic) decisions that point in the right direction have been made, but in reality, they appear insignificant in a global environmental perspective, and are often only incre-mental contributions and cannot radically solve the problems. Such actions may detract attention from the central tasks.Thus, a cacophony of voices incessantly requests that we urgently attend to the climate emergency in different ways, but usually many suggested actions or legislative regu-lations are associated with new problems, such as \u201cpolitically problematic\u201d hurdles rather than solving any significant prob-lem. Usually, long lists of environment-friendly activities are presented without assessing their respective importance. It is true that we should never ignore any contribution as too small, but we must also be aware of the importance and rela-tive proportions to be able to judge what actions should have the highest priority. And which are the most real-istic? An example of an activity to which we all devote ourselves is \u201cwaste sorting\u201d: to separate waste into different \u201celements\u201d make us feel (almost religiously?) good and might to some degree compensate the bad conscience we have when driving a carbon dioxide exhausting gas-guzzling car or using polluting aviation flying off on vacation. Not everybody is aware about how waste sorting might sometimes be waste of effort if not being identical to a \u201cwaste segregation\u201d ensuring pure, high-quality materials by the end. This example, of course, does not question the value of waste sorting but only serves the purpose of illustrating how impor-tant it is to always ask \u201cwhy?\u201d and try to understand how important one action may be in a general context compared to others.We all agree that we need to minimize the use of fossil fuels, but there seems no consensus about priority order in which different actions should be de-ployed. To \u201celectrify,\u201d i.e., to change energy from fossil fuels to electricity, seems generally agreed to be a wise strategy as very clearly explained recently6. However, both how (what distribution among energy sources?) as and depositing it in salt mines or empty oil fields) are considered less significant compared to other more direct solutions. Both biofuels and carbon capture may be associated with social and environmental issues.\u2022  Political legislation and instruments (\u201ctaxonomy\u201d) invented with the original objective of mitigating negative climate change effects should be reanalyzed and changed if not functional. The EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS)\u2014a market for outlet rights, for example, is a local initiative which despite its valuable ambition might be suboptimal with respect to goal of efficient decrease of carbon dioxide emission globally. Similarly, \u201cclimate taxonomy\u201d can create loopholes bypassing a sound TBEB.\u2022  Science-based targets (SBT) to decarbonize the private sector as part of global efforts to achieve the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement should be further encouraged.\u2022  Solve economic and political challenges allowing and promoting establishment of required international energy collaborations (e.g., for solar energy cross-continental transport programs).Keywords : Mitigating Climate Change; Solar Energy; Sea Level Rise; Demand of Fresh Water; Wrong Thinking About Biofuel and Carbon Capture; Electrifying All Energy; Total Balanced Energy Budget; Submarine Electric Cable; Pump Storage Hydroelectric Energy.Figure 1.

Many different electric power sources will be necessary to use in parallel, but orthodox environmentalists do not consider nuclear power necessary, but accept only \u201crenewable energy\u201d listing (often rather vaguely) sun, wind, and water without detailing their respective absolute or relative contributions to a total energy budget. To be realistic, a plan on how to amend the environ-ment/climate problems must detail the various electric energy sources and how their contributions can be scaled-up so they add up to the 100% required in a revised total energy budget.We here present, based on a critical analysis, a path to embark upon to most efficiently restore the atmospheric car-bon concentrations to desirable levels by decreasing the car-bon dioxide. We shall look for solutions, not barriers! Then, a number of concepts need to be reconsidered and some rules even be ignored or circumvented. One example of a problem-atic barrier is the assumption that the only politically correct activities are such that fulfill certain criteria: energy sources should be \u201crenewable\u201d and \u201csustainable,\u201d which means they are replenished on a human timescale\u2014in contrast to fossils that require very long times. Typically, the only energies con-sidered as renewable are sunlight, wind, and geothermal heat, and also combustion sources that are \u201ccarbon dioxide neutral.\u201d Then, biomass fuels may be renewable and also use of fossil fuels if the carbon dioxide they produce is captured and perma-nently kept away from the atmosphere. We claim that this way of looking can be severely misleading and seriously counteract our main objective of solving the climate problem globally.One reason why this way of defining renewable energies is problematic is that it creates a false feeling of improvement while little significant net decrease of carbon dioxide might be achieved. Consider growing forests, which nicely absorb carbon dioxide during photosynthesis, but if then the trees are cut and the timber burnt a stoichiometrically identical amount of carbon dioxide is released again. We claim that growing forests and other plants in order to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere should be a prime target, not burning the timber or any biofuels that crops may be converted into. To produce carbon neutral biodiesel (Europe) or ethanol (United States) from crops or forest timber may at the surface appear smart as it does not increase the atmospheric carbon. But a much better idea, which would decrease the carbon dioxide, is to use the timber for building houses (instead of using cement that produces a lot of carbon dioxide). The biodiesel is clearly more expensive to produce than fossil diesel and, because it is hygroscopic and hydrophilic, could be problematic. For exam-ple, hydroxyl and ether groups abundant in biofuels make them prone to attract moist and provide a grow ground for microbial growth which clogs filters of combustion engines \u2013 potentially risky when used in aviation. We thus strongly advise against use of biofuels for trans-Atlantic flights. Further potential environmental risks have to be con-sidered, especially toxicity of products and effluents from the biodiesel industry has not yet been sufficiently investigated. We shall below suggest that we continue using a certain (relatively minor) amount of fossil carbon products for trans-atlantic aviation and for petrochemical industries, including the production of pharmaceuticals. In parallel we can see a certain role for making biofuels from cattle manure as well as from waists in forestry. Clearly, degrading debris with or-ganisms producing methane - a worse greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide - should be taken care of and made use for as a legitimate biofuel. These amounts, however, are estimated relatively modest in the total picture.Against this backgound, we shall henceforth avoid the use of the concepts renewable and sustainable in energy contexts. Instead, we will take an overall grasp and present a Total Carbon-balanced Energy Budget (TCEB). As we shall see this will give us the opportunity to reconsider in parallel various options and activities, so that our major goal of reduc-ing CO2 emissions to the atmosphere can be reached without closing any viable doors.The balance of carbon dioxide production means that all fuels that produce carbon dioxide will be treated equally. Thus, the use of biofuels, which produce as much (or more) carbon dioxide as fossil fuels, will be discouraged if they are not motivated economically or by being more pure than corre-sponding fossil fuels. This blatantly contrasts a decision taken by nations in Europe (EU, the European Union) about using biofuels \u201cas a renewable alternative in airliners can help re-duce the EU\u2019s carbon footprint.\u201d The use here of \u201crenewable\u201d as a kind of permission letter makes us vigorously protest against this recommendation (and EU law).Of course, natural gas (despite \u201cnatural\u201d sounding nice, but still generally being of fossil origin) must be avoided. As a result of this way of reasoning, the use of fossil oil may be allowed in certain contexts and even encouraged and re-served for certain specific purposes: transatlantic aviation and for important petrochemical industry (producing phar-maceuticals, plastic materials, etc). In our TCEB budget, this kind of remaining, specially permitted, use of fossil fuel will be fortunately relatively small (ca 2%) but can be motivated for safety or economic reasons. This (minor) carbon dioxide emission may be well compensated by what we may call Natural Carbon Capturing (NCC) by photosynthetic green plants (forests on land, here rain forests are particularly im-portant, and algae in oceans and lakes). Thus, planting new trees is important, but note that they should never be con-verted into \u201cbiomass fuel\u201d but the timber, when harvested after typically 15\u201330 years, should be used as valuable building materials (potentially replacing carbon dioxide\u2013pro-ducing cement). Yet, since methane is also a greenhouse gas (even worse than carbon dioxide), biomass fuels based on tak-2240002.indd   9 12/3/2022   10:26:58 AMMol. Front. J. 2022.06:7-23.

However, as we shall see, this part is anticipated to become only a minor contribution to the total. As we will also explain later in more detail, artificial carbon sequestering (taking away carbon dioxide from the air or directly from combustion exhaust at the smokestacks) is an industrial process without any convincing realistic future\u2014both for technological, social and economic reasons and of course not needed in a society without any carbon combustion.Our TCEB budget will depend on where on the planet we are, so we have considered some examples of countries: Sweden, Australia, United States, China etc. Tables 1\u201313\u2014see also Figure 2. It may also depend on to what extent the country is developed\u2014a poor country facing other problems than a rich industrialized one, etc. The energy sources that we will consider here are the following, ranked according to their technological, environmental, and economic significance.SOLAR ENERGYAmong various processes by which solar light may be converted to electric power, the standard silicon-based solar  photovoltaic (SPV) cell, in the future further improved by perovskite (Figure 3) may be considered the simplest solution, both from economic and efficiency point of view. At a given longitude, Figure 2. Current distribution of electric energy consumption in Italy.Figure 3. a. Solar photovoltaic (SPV) panels. The electricity may be transformed into hydrogen gas (Figure 4) that can be stored and converted back to electric power at night in fuel cells. A problem with SPV is that efficiency drops at high temperature. Another that they may contain rare elements (e.g., silver). b. Concentrated solar power (CSP) plants. Thousands of metallic glass panes focus the reflected light of sun at the top of a tall central tower. The tower has a reservoir of potassium and sodium nitrate\u2014typically 25,000 metric tonnes\u2014heated in advance to 288\u00b0C, the mixture then a clear, water-like liquid. This is circulated in narrow, thin-walled tubes, rising in temperature to typically 560\u00b0C when exposed to the concentrated sunlight at the top of the tower. The molten salt efficiently maintains the heat and when the energy is required (also at night) it is converted to electricity through a conventional steam turbine. In contrast to photovoltaic panels, CSP is a dispatchable generator and can adjust power output according to an order \u2013 and work at night too.2240002.indd   10 12/3/2022   10:26:59 AMMol. Front.

To harvest solar electricity at a phase-shifted longitude, to mitigate intermittency, is generally not considered feasible. An exception may be some 3-h energy economy shift between the west and east coasts in the United States, and similarly in Russia.By contrast, latitude shifts could make a big difference. While at the North Pole there is no in-termittency but the sun is up all 24 h in the summer, the light intensity is ex-tremely weak, proportional to cosine of the latitude (cosine 90\u00b0 = 0). For the same reason, in Sweden, e.g., at Malmoe (latitude 55\u00b0, cosine 55\u00b0 = 0.57) or at Haparanda (latitude 66\u00b0; cosine 66\u00b0 = 0.41), has lower projected sun-light intensities compared to Sahara latitude 20\u00b0 (cosine 20\u00b0 = 0.94), even on a sunny summer day. However, the difference is much bigger than these latitude projection fac-tors indicate, as a result of fewer sun hours during the winter (3 h in Haparanda on 1st Janu-ary) and moreover also frequently cloudy weather in the northern countries, making the difference at least an order of mag-nitude less than in Sahara where 4300 sun hours yearly is close to the theoretical maximum 4450 h.As is obvious from this background, a lot may be gained by harvesting solar light on a solar panel farm at a sunny lati-tude, such as in the Sahara desert (Figure 5). For example, the current electric en-ergy consumption in Sweden (170 TWh) can be covered by a farm slot of only 6 km \u00d7 6 km in Sahara (185 TWh as-suming 36 GW, 4300 sun hours and 40% transfer efficiency). Correspondingly, the whole of Europe\u2019s electric demand may be covered by the solar electricity from a solar panel park of 70 km \u00d7 70 km. For several US states, closeness to desert arid areas is obvious. In Ukraine, most of the plain areas are reserved for valuable production of grain crop, but southern Crimea areas experience solar irradiation levels reaching approximately 5.8 kilowatt-hours per square meter per day on average over a year.Figure 5. Desert electric energy and freshwater reservoirs. Size of solar SPV or CSP plant that could deliver today\u2019s electric energy consumption in Sweden. Also shown is the size of a \u201cmelt water cube\u201d corresponding to the land ice of Antarctica, which if going into the ocean would raise the sea level by ca 60 m. This fresh water could be envisaged distributed to freshwater reservoirs maintained at suitable locations around the world. It would suffice with 10 million reservoirs each 100 m deep and size 5 km \u00d7 5 km = 2.5 Gm3 each to mitigate the sea level rise and at the same time take care of the need for fresh water and magazines for storing hydroelectric \u201cpump-back\u201d energy. With current sea-level rise rate, less than 1 million reservoirs would be needed for the following 20\u201340 years. Note that the reservoirs only in Sweden correspond to 40 Gm3 and thus a significant contribution.Figure 4. Hydrogen produced by electrolysis of water. Electric energy from solar plants or wind power is stored as hydrogen gas under pressure in gas cylinders. Efficiency, today only 50\u201360%, is anticipated to be improved in the future by development of new electrocatalysts. The hydrogen (combining with air oxygen) regains electric power in fuel cells with high ef-ficiency, to deliver power immediately upon demand, when no solar or wind power is available.2240002.indd   11 12/3/2022   10:26:59 AMMol.

The project anticipates 17\u201320 GW of peak solar power gener-ation (from a 11 km \u00d7 11 km piece of land) and some 30\u201340 GWh battery storage at both entrance and exit terminals of the submarine cable7.An alternative or complement, although somewhat less effective, to direct electric cable transport of energy is hydrogen gas produced by electrolysis of pure water (Figure 4), which could be transported in vessels from Mediterranean harbors to countries like Sweden in northern Europe. Hydrogen produced in this way is environmental-friendly in that it produces electric power with only water as exhaust when combined with oxygen from air in a fuel cell. However, the efficiency of the electrolysis step is still less perfect (only 50\u201360%)\u2014a loss that may be toler-ated, however, in a situation with excess of solar energy (Figure 5). Future electrolysis catalysts are anticipated to sig-nificantly improve efficiency.A drawback of SPV-based power is its intermittency, no power in the nighttime. Another is the use of rare ele-ments in today\u2019s PV cells (silver). A third is the fact that the efficiency drops significantly with temperature, making SPV parks far from optimal in heat desert contexts. Then another technology, also shown in Figure 3, so-called concentrated solar power (CSP) is worth considering. CSP requires a more sophisticated design with thousands of mirrors reflecting the sun on the top of a central tower where molten salt is heated to higher temperatures. The heat is transferred to water and electricity is generated in a traditional steam turbine. CSP has several advantages to SPV: (i) the molten salt heat reservoir may produce energy also at night, (ii) the design is not sensitive to ambient temperature, and (iii) the construction does not involve any rare elements, but uses only steel tubes and ordinary sodium and potassium nitrate salt. Due to the more complicated and im-mobile construction, CSP energy is with higher investment costs somewhat more expensive per MWh than SPV.In conclusion, solar electric energy is generally relatively simple and inexpen-sive, so also developing countries should have great possibilities to  contribute to solving both their own as well as other nations\u2019 climate problem\u2014especially when considering the fact that states near the Equator (say in Africa) have ample opportunities to expand on and benefit from this kind of en-ergy project. It is important that politicians as soon as pos-sible analyze and address potential collaboration problems, both regarding the installment and potential leasing of land for the solar energy production, as well as the collaborations that the transit and transport of electric energy across the third country involves. Again, the global aspect is important to consider, including how the demographic development will cause problems or offer opportunities.WATER\u2014HYDROELECTRIC ENERGYHydroelectric power is available in most countries that have mountains, such as Switzerland, France, Norway, United States, Australia, South America, and Sweden. Depending on the size of the water magazines, hydroelectric power can be the main adjustable source of electric power to mitigate the intermittency of solar and wind power. It is also one of the most environment-friendly and inexpensive sources of ener-gy. In Norway, current electric power is by 96% hydroelectric, in Sweden 40% while in Finland only 23%.In Sweden, many smaller rivers could be still exploited by establishing small electric power stations to add signifi-cantly to the whole. More importantly, one of the big rivers (Vindel\u00e4lv), not yet exploited for various preservative environ-mental reasons, should be considered a next major project for the accelerated establishment of a hydroelectric power sta-tion and, we suggest, also developing the option of a \u201cpump back\u201d facility for energy storage (Figure 7)8.Under favorable circumstances, hydroelectric reser-voirs may thus serve also for storing electric energy using Figure 6. Hydrogen as fuel or for energy storage.2240002.indd   12 12/3/2022   10:26:59 AMMol. Front. J. 2022.06:7-23. Downloaded from www.worldscientific.comby CHALMERS UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY on 03/24/23.

In a future fully electrified society, storage of energy will be of utmost importance as a buffer to mitigate the negative effects of intermittency power dips, including mitigating blackout accidents. We shall deal with available power storage alternatives below.TIDAL ENERGYA special form of environment-friendly hydroelectric power is tidal energy.8 Early installations were electric turbines placed in barriers built at ocean sites exhibiting large sea-level vari-ations, emptying and filling-up some big lake inside the bar-rier. More recent developments are under-water windmill-like farms of turbines harvesting the kinetic energy of tidal cur-rents close to coasts. An advantage to wind power is that tidal energy has a predictable intermittency, the tide occurring at defined times every day. A disadvantage is the limited number of sites close to coast having tides of sufficient current energy to warrant the use of tidal-power systems.WIND POWERThis is considered one of the most inexpensive and environ-ment-friendly forms of energy source. However, like the solar energy, it is intermittent (but unfortunately in an unpredict-able way), which will require both backup continuous energy sources, like nuclear energy or hydroelectric energy, and/or big and evenly distributed energy storage systems (see be-low). Depending on the distance between the  windmill parks and major consumers, the electric grid system may face se-vere challenges requiring installing extensive nets of power lines. When combined with the additional requests for elec-tricity as a result of total electrification (say, typically a dou-bled total electric energy power), this is a major challenge to a country\u2019s energy politics.Despite the economical and environmental factors speaking in favor of wind power, the installment of new windmill parks has not been uncontroversial. In Sweden, several communities have objected also against establish-ments of windmill parks at sea outside the windy west-coast (\u201ca park of windmills could disturb the wild life and also the scenic view by breaking the horizon\u201d). Such local resistance seems to become more often overruled lately, the need for auxiliary energy sources becoming more generally accepted.NUCLEAR POWERNuclear power is the orphan energy source in many countries, including Sweden where the cost for each MWh of delivered electricity must defray also all costs for future dismantling of the power stations and final deposit of the radioactive waste for at least 100,000 years, etc. Thus, nuclear power electricity is the most expensive form of energy, but at the same time also the most reliable, and the only one may trust when the temperature drops below \u221220\u00b0C and there is no wind.There have been several suggestions about alternative nuclear power plants, including the Next Generation Nuclear Power Plant Project10 (which seems to have stalled) and Tho-rium Nuclear Power (tried in China and Indonesia), the latter having the advantage of shorter-lifetime waste products11. Recently, small modular reactors (SMR) are being devel-oped12, which could be produced in large number industrially and provide electric power at different points in a geographi-cally extended country thus decreasing transport problems. In Sweden, nuclear power is only allowed at a few sites ac-cording to the law. While SMR sounds practical and (relatively) safe, a network with many plants all over clearly makes the security substantially harder to supervise than a few reactors (currently at three sites). Two reactors at another site (Barse-b\u00e4ck) 20 km from Copenhagen have closed down, the second one in 2005. However, this might be a promising site for a set of new safe SMR reactors in view of the great electric power demand in the southern-most part of Sweden and the fact that the electric power lines still exist using Barseb\u00e4ck as a connection node.ENERGY STORAGE\u2014BATTERIES, HYDROGEN, AND HYDROELECTRICAs mentioned, an energy buffer is a prerequisite in an en-ergy system with considerable intermittency. There are three main alternatives for storing electric energy (Figures 6 and 7): batteries, pump-back hydroelectric storage, and hydrogen produced by electrolysis of water and stored under pressure. A potential storage capacity spread homogeneously over a country could be all the cars and trucks that are charging their batteries at nighttime. Against appropriate economic compensation, the car owners can provide access to their batteries which represent a large capacity that could smooth sudden short electricity demands. An electric car has typically a lithium-ion battery with capacity of 100 kWh. With a park of 5 million cars, a total capacity of 500 GWh may be antici-pated\u2014say 1 TWh when all trucks too are electrified. In ad-dition to the low-weight Li+ batteries also traditional heavier lead and nickel\u2013iron batteries should be used stationary on ground since they do not depend so sensitively on the mining of rare elements.Clean hydrogen gas produced by electrolysis of fresh water (not salt water) provides a convenient way to store electric energy that can be provided on demand when not available from sun or wind. The electrolytic hydro-gen production has still limited efficiency, but the develop-ment of new electrocatalysts are being developed, and the reverse process of producing electricity in fuel cells 2240002.indd   13 12/3/2022   10:26:59 AMMol.

The method stores energy in the form of gravitational potential energy of water, pumped from a lower elevation reservoir to a higher elevation. Low-cost surplus off-peak electric power is typically used to run the pumps. During the periods of high electrical demand, the stored wa-ter is released through turbines to produce electric power. Pumped-storage hydroelectricity allows energy from inter-mittent sources (such as solar and wind power) or excess electricity from continuous base-load sources (such as nuclear) to be saved for periods of higher demand. The  reservoirs so far used with pumped storage have been quite small when compared to conventional hydroelectric dams of similar pow-er capacity, and generating periods are often less than half a day. A good example is the Ffestiniog Power Station, a PSH scheme in north-west Wales. The power station can deliver 360 MW electricity within 60 seconds of the need arising. The scheme has the capacity to power the whole of North Wales for several hours. In Sweden, it is suggested that the river Vindel\u00e4lv is exploited for additional hydroelectric power in combination with a system for pump-back power storage.FOSSIL CARBON PRODUCTSAs will be argued, biofuels are unsuitable for certain appli-cations, such as transatlantic aviation where standard fos-sil fuels are more safe. Biofuels may be even environmental threats due to their hydrophilic properties making them quickly dispersing pollutants when leaked into sea or ground-waters. Therefore, we shall argue that fossil products should be reserved and preferentially used for certain purposes such as long-range (transatlantic) aviation and in petrochemical and pharmaceutical industries. Politicians often seem prone to accept biofuels as they are considered \u2018carbon neutral\u2019 de-spite the fact that they produce as much (or more) carbon dioxide as fossil fuels. It is important here to note that the use of fossil combustion can be wisely balanced by consider-ing the natural capturing of carbon dioxide that a calculated aliquot of green plants may take care of. Thus, green crops, forests, and other photosynthetic carbon dioxide assimilating organisms, including algae, should be promoted and allowed to do their work. But they should never be  transformed into biofuels! The use of fossil petroproducts reserved for trans-atlantic aviation and chemical industry should correspond to a relatively modest part (ca 2%) of the total energy budget.BIOFUELSContradictory factors in application of CO2 sequestration with sustainable biofuel benefits have been reviewed and although there are certain environmental advantages of biofuels there are also harmful ecological, social and economic impacts - food shortages in poorer countries, for example, referred to as possible consequence. Also, production of biofuel feedstocks, particularly food crops could increase water pollution from emitted nutrients, pesticides and sediment. In addition, grow-ing the same crop every year may deprive the soil of nutrients that are put back into the soil through crop rotation13,14. Figure 7.

Biofuel is less suitable for use in low temperatures and is more likely to attract moisture than fossil diesel, which cre-ates problems in cold weather. As mentioned, also microbial growth could be an issue.As has already been noticed in pollution contexts, biofu-els are hard to retrieve when leaked into sea or rivers where they have toxic impact15\u201318.In conclusion, it is debatable whether it be wise to use biofuels in combustion engines, especially for aviation (in\u00a0 conflict with what has been proposed by EU) or trans-ported in large quantities where risks for leakage into sea or groundwater exist. However, an exception is the methane pro-duced by fermentation of manure or wood or other organic debris from forestry \u2013 methane being an even worse green-house gas than CO2 and, therefore, ought to be a legitimate  biofuel13\u201315.CAPTURING CARBON DIOXIDEThere are two ways carbon dioxide may be retrieved: one that\u00a0we shall call natural carbon dioxide capturing from the atmosphere (NCC) and one we call engineered carbon captur-ing (ECC). While NCC is taken care of naturally by all green plants, especially rain forests and algae in the sea, the ECC is not practically possible from the atmosphere but has to be implemented at the sources at the smokestacks of the coal- or gas-burning power plants. From fundamental thermodynamic laws, the energy costs for extracting a chemical compound from a mixture are high if the concentration of the compound is low. This is the so-called entropic part of the free energy (or exergy) associated with the extraction process. In the case of CO2, this corresponds to the chasing of one molecule among 200 other molecules (oxygen and nitrogen) and one has then to pay a corresponding extra energy (this energy might have to be obtained by combustion, then further producing more of the undesirable CO2). Therefore, the extraction of CO2 from air is practically unfeasible. One step toward reducing CO2 emissions is to capture the CO2 generated during combus-tion and store it in a suitable place. This process of carbon capture and storage (CCS) has theoretically the potential to re-duce future world emissions from energy by as much as 20%. CCS is already operating in trials, with 3 megatons of CO2 per year from power plants or natural gas cleanup being captured and stored. Norway early applied CCS and separated CO2 from their natural gas which contains up to 10% CO2. How-ever, to commercialize carbon capture, as well as transport of liquified carbon dioxide and its storage in exploited oil fields or saline formations, many technological, commercial, and political hurdles remain to be overcome. Separation of CO2 is the step that consumes the most energy and results in the highest cost. Historical examples of CO2 separation, if scaled-up, could consume 25\u201340% of the fuel energy of a power plant and be responsible for 70% or more of the additional costs in CCS19\u201321. There is also the question of thermodynam-ic stability of depositing carbon dioxide under high pressure, including the risk of hazardous amounts of CO2 bursting up to the surface (potentially killing people). In view of our end-aim of total exclusion of carbon combustion, we conclude that ECC will probably never become significant (<1%). By contrast to the ECC, the NCC i.e. plants capturing carbon dioxide should be promoted as much as possible but, as we have argued, the plants never be converted into biofuel. Instead they should be allowed to keep the CO2 as carbohydrates and to produce oxygen.RISING SEA WATER LEVELS AND INCREASING NEED OF FRESH WATERThe threat of rising sea levels as a result of land ice melt-ing with an increased global temperature scenario might be mitigated by installing big permanent water reservoirs. They could also address another serious challenge: global lack of fresh water. It would suffice with some 10 million reservoirs, each 100 m deep and size 5 km \u00d7 5 km = 2.5 Gm3, to fully mitigate the sea level rise and at the same time take care of the need for fresh water and magazines for storing hydroelectric \u201cpump-back\u201d energy. With current sea-level rise rate, less than 1 million reservoirs would suf-fice to compensate the melt water for the following 20\u201340 years. Note that the reservoirs and lakes only in Sweden correspond to 40 Gm3 and thus constitute a significant con-tribution.POLITICAL RELUCTANCY AND CLIMATE POPULISMThere are many examples, at least when viewed hindwise, of unwise political decisions driven by populistic opinions. We mention two examples, both based on militant protests in the early 1970s: the antinuclear movements in Germany (Die Gr\u00fcnen), leading to the annihilation of nuclear power, despite lack of any sensible complements, and in Sweden protests leading to abandoning exploitation of river Vindel\u00e4lv\u2014a po-tential addition of hydroelectric power. Developing hydroelec-tricity presents challenges due to public concern about the environmental impact of generating facilities and, therefore, development of further river sites has been prohibited, to maintain their natural state.Another more recent example in Sweden, are protests from local communities which have obviated the establish-ments of off-shore windmill parks outside the windy west-coast.2240002.indd   15 12/3/2022   10:27:00 AMMol.

This should lead to barriers that will conduct development, like a river, to follow certain boundaries. An example is defin-ing and greenwashing processes that are \u201crenewable\u201d and \u201csustainable\u201d believing that they will always contribute to a movement in the right direction. The problem that a law that is not based on true insight about the basic facts, such as  available engineering technology, is very much like pro-hibiting thinking or speaking about certain things. In some religions such militant prohibits exist, as in dictatorships the freedom of the word does not exist, etc.An example of strange legislation blatantly violating freedom of thinking and speaking was the Swedish thought ban according to a decision in 1987 by the Parliament as a result of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster: \u201cNobody may make construction drawings, estimate costs, purchase equipment or undertake any such preparations in purpose of building a nuclear reactor within the country. Penalty according to the law be jail of length corresponding to causing someone else\u2019s death.\u201dHOW URGENT IS ACTION\u2014SHOULD WE PANIC?You often hear that with the current neglect of seriously at-tending to the task of mitigating the emergent climate change, we may soon pass tipping points that take us irreversibly into catastrophic situations from which there is no return. Howev-er, while the opposite, a big lowering of the Earth\u2019s tempera-ture would clearly take us into an irreversible catastrophe (a white planet that will inevitably lead to eternal ice age), there is no scientific evidence that increasing temperature will have irreversible climate consequences that cannot be repaired by a restored temperature. Of course, an example of irreversible development is if species go extinct. When it comes to a stage where the land ices of Antarctica and Greenland melt and the sea levels rise beyond 50 m, a very awkward situation no doubt arises\u2014with most capitals becoming submarine like Atlantis, and some low-lying nations even subject to com-plete extinction. But other drastic changes of climate change may then occur too which could take very long to restore. For example, a dying out of the Gulf Stream, the warm and swift current that makes Scandinavia having a mild climate com-pared to that of the same latitudes in North America, would have drastic effects. It could even change the abundant winds so that cool northerly winds could make a cold climate even cooler\u2014potentially leading to a new Scandinavian ice age. Climate represents dissipative systems that are far from equi-librium and therefore often impossible to predict\u2014the current observations of higher frequency, as it appears, of hurricanes may indicate another undesirable consequence of the climate change.SCIENCE-BASED TARGETSThe role of Science-based targets (SBT) to decarbonize the private sector as part of global effort to achieve the tem-perature goal of the Paris Agreement has intensified. SBTs provide a clearly defined pathway for the private sector to reduce greenhouse gas emissions22. The pathways are con-sidered \u2018science-based\u2019 if they are in line with what the lat-est climate science deems necessary to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement23. But more research is needed to dis-tinguish between substantive and symbolic SBTs24. Further research from a diversity of approaches is required to better understand how SBTs may facilitate or hinder a transition to low-carbon societies.SBT adoption by larger, more visible companies in high-income countries has accelerated. These companies tend to have a prior reputation for managing climate impacts. Lower rates of SBT are found in low- and middle-income countries, in certain emission-intensive sectors, and by small- and medium-sized enterprises22.CONCLUSIONSThere seems to be only rather incremental progress and many partly incoherent ways the governments of our world address the climate effects of human-caused emissions of greenhouse gases. Many concrete ways of action, to mitigate climate change, seem considered politically (read: economically) problematic. Lack of international consensus seems to paralyze the politicians. One gets a feeling lately that economists and lawyers have hijacked the organiza-tions that should exert leadership, instead of the scientists and engineers who ought to be in the driver\u2019s seat. Unfortu-nately, the  seriousness of the climate change together with the manifold and complexity of proposed cures presents a situation where the details make us confused and unable to see the global features of the problem, let alone how to amend them. Here the favoring of \u2018solutions\u2019 that are just complicated ways of bypassing some uncomfortable ba-sic rules are worrying. However, there are already feasible 2240002.indd   16 12/3/2022   10:27:00 AMMol. Front. J. 2022.06:7-23. Downloaded from www.worldscientific.comby CHALMERS UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY on 03/24/23.

Phrased as a set of the-ses some of which can be seen as objections against some of today\u2019s too cemented climate views and policy, we here claim that:\u2022  Our long-term goal must be to stop using all carbon-containing fuels, including natural gas and other fossil products as well as biofuels.\u2022  We must electrify society and industry, with electric-ity from only non-carbon-based power including nuclear power, hydro-electric, wind and solar power.\u2022  We must prepare ourselves for changes. Even if the pre-sent emission volumes of carbon dioxide were possible to stop immediately, various fast as well as slow lag effects are inevitable and negative development will therefore continue for considerable time.\u2022  We must count with continued melting of land ice, the complete liquifying of the Antarctica ice expected to lead to a global sea-level rise by some 60 m, making most capitals submarine. Among various solutions to mitigate effects of ice melting, including lowered global temperatures, the fol-lowing is proposed.\u2022  To mitigate sea level rise, it is proposed that stationary water reservoirs be built around the world. With esti-mated melting rates, it would require ca 1 million reservoirs be deployed or expanded during the next 20\u201340 years.\u2022  Such reservoirs could also solve the emergent problem of lack of fresh water in many places. They could also be used for local storage of hydroelectric energy by using PSH technology.\u2022  All forms of energy production sources and consump-tion should be analyzed according to a TBEB with the objective of minimizing the emissions of greenhouse gases.\u2022  For each region/country, a table of available or conceiv-able complementary electric energy sources should be made and ranked according to TBEB\u2014the sources given priority weights depending on feasibility, significance, and environmental friendliness. Tables are presented for 13 countries. Generally, we find the following rank of prior-ity applicable.\u2022  Solar energy from desert arid areas is given highest priority in replacing carbon-combustion-based forms of energy. Submarine electric cables may be deployed along the Australia-Singapore model, if available power grids are insufficient for energy transport.\u2022  Electrolysis of water producing clean hydrogen gas is given very high priority both for producing environment-friendly fuel as well as for energy storage. Improved efficiency should be achieved by development of electrolysis catalysts.\u2022  Hydroelectric power in combination with PSH is giv-en high priority to mitigate grid power fluctuations and source (solar and wind) intermittence.\u2022  False hope should not be seeded among society and politicians by inflating projects that are less realistic or suboptimal for technological or other reasons. Here, prob-ably most forms of biofuels (which although being carbon neutral do produce carbon dioxide) and carbon capture (catching carbon dioxide gas at the combustion site, compressing it to liquid and depositing it in salt mines or empty oil fields) are considered less significant compared to other more direct solutions. Both biofuels and carbon capture may be associated with social and environmental issues. \u2022  Political legislation and instruments invented with the original objective of mitigating negative climate change effects should be reanalyzed and changed if not functional. The EU ETS\u2014a market for outlet rights, for example, is a local initiative, which despite its valuable ambition appears suboptimal with respect to goal of ef-ficient decrease of carbon dioxide emission globally. Simi-larly, \u201cclimate taxonomy\u201d can create loopholes bypassing a sound TBEB.\u2022  Science-based targets (SBT) to decarbonize the private sector as part of global efforts to achieve the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement should be further encouraged.\u2022  Solve economic and political challenges allowing and promoting establishment of required international energy collaborations (e.g., for solar energy cross-continental transport programs)CONCLUDING REMARKWe have for simplicity focused on total conversion to electric energy without discussing the optimizations that choice of storage and transfer forms of energy involve, such as stor-age and cost restrictions in comparison e.g. between electric battery and hydrogen gas storage. An alternative to electric-ity transport in power cables is hydrogen transported in gas pipelines (or in vessels), where variations in transfer rates and related costs could be of decisive economical and techni-cal importance. While electric power needs to be consumed directly, if not stored in battery, the storage and delivery of hydrogen can be done more independent from consumption rate and is scalable without dependence on precious materi-als like Li and Co (in batteries). Because of this, converting the electricity into hydrogen is often preferable when the alterna-tive battery storage has been exhausted. To cover this aspect of immediate handling of all produced solar and wind energy various energy storage options must be compared, i.e. batter-ies vs hydrogen gas storage vs PHS and so on.2240002.indd   17 12/3/2022   10:27:00 AMMol.

Keywords: Climate change, modernism, nature, more-than-human, capitalism, scale 2   I Modernity and climate change Anthropogenic climate change is a quintessentially \u2018modern\u2019 problem. The fossil fuel-based economies of industrial capitalism, the key economic feature of modernity, are the root cause of enhanced greenhouse gas emissions destabilising global climate. The central intellectual feature of modernity, the Western scientific method, provides the means by which we know that climate change is happening and can predict future changes. Climate change research is one of Enlightenment science\u2019s most important contributions of the last half century. It can be read as a triumphant moment for the \u2018high-modernist optic\u2019 (Scott 1998: 347), requiring perspectives both backwards and forwards in time, using evidence from microscopic to global scales. To the extent that humanity is responding, it is by and large doing so within the terms of the modernist project. Many of us have an urge to \u2018fix\u2019, \u2018manage\u2019 or \u2018reverse\u2019 dangerous climate change. Meanwhile, the management of \u2018global\u2019 environmental problems is increasingly undertaken by international governance mechanisms that build on the sovereignty of the nation-state \u2013 a classic political expression of modernity.  In the long post-Copenhagen moment, when an international grouping of nation-states failed to deliver the climate change action that was widely hoped for, and the issue has slipped into the \u2018too hard\u2019 basket for the time being, it is pertinent to ask, how much does modernist thinking provide us with the tools to solve the problems it created? This paper sprang from a dual tension we encountered whenever we sought to answer this question. First, that even though anthropogenic climate change is argued to be a problem of human origins, solutions to which will require human actions and engagements, modernity separates people from climate change in both the articulation of the problem and its proposed solutions. The universalising tendencies of science abstract it from the vagaries of individual human experience; as Jasanoff (2010) argues, that is the whole point of robust science. Global climate is by definition constructed from long term averaged statistics, and quite distinct from short term local weather; it had to be brought into being to be rendered governable (Oels 2005). As Hulme (2010b: 560) put it, \u2018no-one experiences or witnesses global-mean temperature and it requires extraordinary efforts of the imagination for it to acquire purchase in the practices of everyday living.\u2019 Global political responses in the modernist tradition of internationalism are in the process of not only reifying a narrowly defined set of solutions, but also promulgating widespread feelings of disempowerment as top-down mechanisms stall.  Second, we have ourselves argued that concepts of multiple and relational agency are much more consistent with the empirical evidence on climate change from both natural and social sciences than are binary frameworks (Head 2008). Yet we were not convinced that \u2018amodern\u2019 approaches had 3  sufficiently taken account of evident human power over earth surface processes, nor that they have yet articulated sufficiently \u2018constructive\u2019 or \u2018generative\u2019 pathways ahead. The latter reticence stems partly from a reluctance to embrace narrowly normative solutions, reluctance that our own research is entirely in sympathy with (Gibson et al. 2011a). Yet, how are we to live in the world? Despite the difficulties, it is hard to imagine how anything other than a global consciousness and practice can meet the challenges of climate change. Clearly, much work needs to be done on what forms this might take. As Beck (2010: 261) argues,  \u2018If IPCC predictions and those of more recent scientific modelling come to pass over the next couple of decades, then climate change may yet prove to be the most powerful of forces summoning a civilizational community of fate into existence\u2019.  In this paper we identify and bring together several threads in recent human geography that could help shape debate on climate change in the social sciences and more broadly. Human and environmental geographers have a long history of contributing to climate change discussions, and emphasising that climate vulnerability cannot be separated from underlying social and political dimensions (e.g. Bohle et al. 1994).  There are many geographic contributions to grounded studies of place, local diversity and the difference this makes to issues like adaptive capacity (Adger et al. 2005, Adger et al. 2009, Barnett and Campbell 2010). Increasing recognition of the social and cultural dimensions of climate change has led to greater (and perhaps belated) interest in the sociocultural research tradition in geography and cognate disciplines (e.g. Hulme 2008, O\u2019Brien 2011). Our specific argument is that human geography\u2019s combination of both deconstructive and empirical compulsions , found in coexisting emphases on critical theory and ethnographic type research methods that focus on material, embodied practices , provides a rather unique possibility to be both unsettling and generative/creative. We believe this is exemplified best in the ideas of Gibson-Graham (2006, 2008) , whose work we use to think through how to reframe the politics of climate change in response to, and beyond, modernity. Gibson-Graham (2008) identify three practices that assist us here and on which we attempt to build: \u2022 Ontological reframing to produce the ground of possibility \u2022 Re-reading to uncover or excavate the possible \u2022 Creativity to generate actual possibilities where none formerly existed Ontological reframing is undertaken by engaging critically with stubbornly persistent assumptions, norms and the taken-for-granted \u2013 then looking for ways to put together differently. We are keen here to consider how climate change can be reframed in this way by drawing attention to the persistence of the human/nature binary in climate change debates (section II). We subsequently explore how relational frameworks can contribute to the reframing, putting knowledge back together differently.  4  Rereading and creative generation then proceeds through fine-grained studies of local voices and practices, including identifying vernacular capacities that could prove vital to climate change responses. It is these voices and practices that a modernist vision of problem and solution, scaled predominantly around the nation-state, runs the risk of ignoring. We bring together geographic work on governance, scale and power that illuminates much more diverse pathways of agency (section III). Importantly, geographic work on relational scale and cross-scalar agency offers pathways to re-empower the local without reifying it as a pre-given subset of the global. As Gibson-Graham (2008, p.3) remind us, \u2018to change our understanding is to change the world, in small and sometimes major ways\u2019. A starting point is looking for productive or progressive spaces in unlikely places (Lewis 2009), to crack open new ways to converse. Throughout the paper we draw on diverse examples where this can and might be done, using a refreshed conception of scale and power that avoids locking down territories as containers of action. In the process of becoming, and becoming understood as, a global problem, climate change has become recognised as a hybrid assemblage constituted as more-than-climate, comprising discourses, bureaucracies and texts as well as atmospheric gases (Demeritt 2001, Hulme 2008).  The emerging critical analysis of climate-change-as-assemblage has much in common then with the critique of related concepts like neoliberalism (Dean 1999; Peck 2004; Castree 2008a, 2008b), modernity and the economy (Mitchell 2002), colonialism (Thomas 1994, Anderson 2007) and capitalism (Gibson-Graham 1996, 2006). Such concepts have dominant, taken-for-granted meanings, but can be analytically revealed as constituted through practices and discourses \u2013 thus inviting critiques that destabilise them and offer alternatives.  There is a key difference, however. The above scholarly critique has usually pulled the various threads of modern industrial capitalism apart in order to imagine how subsistence might be constituted differently, and with more attention to social and ecological justice. The ontological status of categories such as neoliberalism, the economy, capitalism and colonialism has been challenged, in order to challenge their universalist power \u2013 in other words to contest and resist the concepts. Our approach to climate change is similar in epistemology but different in intent. We want to contribute further to such deconstruction not to contest the concept of climate change, but to suggest reconfigured responses. Indeed, we are concerned as are others that academic deconstruction of the climate change assemblage may run the risk of unwittingly buttressing reactionary sceptics and a range of vested interests. The step that has not yet been taken in relation to climate change is to go from the ontological reframing to the generative possibilities. We seek here to outline some possible directions.  5  II  Beyond the human/nature binary in climate change? Over the last several decades there have been widespread attempts in human geography and cognate disciplines to unsettle and dismantle the human/nature binary, as well as necessary work in analysing its extraordinary resilience and embeddedness in our thinking and institutions. A large and complex body of work has used framings such as network, hybrid, assemblage and more-than-human geographies to reconfigure our understanding of relationality, drawing particularly on scholars such as Latour (1993), Whatmore (2002) and Haraway (2008).There are two main features of this work that are particularly relevant to our argument here. The first is the myth of human exceptionalism. Haraway is the strongest on this, citing multiple examples of the ways that various dividing lines between humans and the rest of nature are being exploded by current scientific research. The default assumption must be that the human and non-humans are mutually implicated \u2013 they co-constituted the world. The question is not \u2018whether\u2019 but \u2018how\u2019. Answers to the \u2018how\u2019 question have given us a range of richly detailed, thick descriptions of the complexity of the world. There are some tensions here with how power is treated (Castree 2002), and useful critiques have come particularly from political ecology: \u2018The world is networked, and always has been, but it is NOT flat, not socially and not ecologically\u2019 (Rocheleau and Roth 2007: 436). For Clark (2011: xx) \u2018most of material reality is not ours to make over\u2019; and yet in the context of climate change, it is important not to lose sight of the demonstrable power of human actors; humans are exceptional agents of change in earth surface processes. But, as Anderson (2005: 271) has argued, to \u2018begin \u2026 by assuming a radical or pure break between humanity and animality\u2019 is a rather different thing to demonstrating spatially and temporally variable differences in the ecological roles of specific peoples and groups of non-humans. Nor does it \u2018mean introducing a limitless number of actors and networks, all of which are somehow of equal significance and power. Rather, it means making this issue of power and agency a question, instead of an answer known in advance\u2019 (Mitchell 2002: 52-3). A second and related feature of relational frameworks is their anti-essentialism. Drawing on Latourian thinking, the argument is that the society-nature dualism maintains a misconception \u2018that entities are \u201cessentially\u201d either social or natural prior to their interaction with one another\u2019 (Castree 2002: 118). Rather \u2018the social and the natural are co-constitutive\u2019 within myriad networks (Castree 2002:120). Causal explanations have not kept pace with advances in empirical research, and binary frameworks are challenged by the empirical evidence of mutual constitution and embeddedness.  There are a number of inter-connected implications here for how we might think differently about climate change. First, emphasis on the moment of collision between two separate entities (the 6  \u2019impact\u2019 of \u2018humans\u2019 on \u2018climate\u2019) has favoured historical explanations that depend on correlation in time and space, to the detriment of the search for mechanisms of connection rather than simple correlation (Head 2008). This is particularly important to how we think about the future, since removal of the \u2018human\u2019 is presumably not our solution of first resort. As Hulme argues, \u2018it is as irrelevant as it is impossible to find the invisible fault line between natural and artificial climate\u2019 (Hulme 2010a: 270). Second, putting the significant explanatory divide between humans and nature requires the conflation of bundles of variable processes under the headings \u2018human\u2019, \u2018climate\u2019 and \u2018nature\u2019. For example \u2018climatic processes\u2019 can include everything from astronomical forcing at 100,000 year timescales to ENSO cycles of a decade or so, and trends that can be warming, cooling, wetting or drying. In practical terms, taking apart the climate monolith allows us to consider how mooted anthropogenic changes leading to future scenarios will take expression in and through existing patterns of weather and climatic variability (Hulme 2008). Taking apart the human monolith forces us to consider exactly what the constituent practices of solutions might be. For the most part the deconstructive effort is yet to pervade physical geography and archaeology, where \u2018human impacts\u2019 \u2013 a conceptualisation that positions humans as outside the system under analysis, as outside nature \u2013 remains the dominant, if implicit, conceptualisation of the human-nature engagement over timescales of hundreds and thousands of years (Head 2008). Nevertheless, this long-term perspective has provided a crucial underpinning to the identification of anthropogenic climate change in the palaeoclimatic record. So, a key contradiction persists: we maintain dualistic ways of talking about things (human impacts, human interaction with environment, anthropogenic climate change, cultural landscapes, social-ecological systems), while the empirical evidence increasingly demonstrates how inextricably humans have become embedded in earth surface and atmospheric processes.  There is scope for more common ground between relational approaches, and (modernist) studies in climate change, ecology, physical geography and prehistory that are spatially and temporally fine-grained, that deal with complexity and contingency, and that acknowledge multiple agency (see for example Harris et al. 2006, Hobbs et al. 2006).  To this end we need to find a way to converse with more diverse communities of physical scientists (climatologists, geochronologists, engineers) across this common ground, to make necessary conversations mutually legible \u2013 as well as impress on colleagues in the sciences the urgency of engaging with relational critiques rather than dismissing them out of hand. Relational approaches are consistent with \u2018multiple, contingent and nonessentialist\u2019 (Castree 2002: 121) agency as recognised in the natural sciences. As Haraway argues, \u2018the opportunism of evolution is a great boon to the nonteleological thinking of the posthumanities\u2019 (2008: 373). Conversely the reluctance of many relational human geographers to 7  offer definitive and constructive ways forward, beyond what appears on the surface to be only deconstruction, frustrates physical colleagues \u2013 a frustration we must take seriously and seek to ameliorate. We have found considerable variation in the extent to which science-trained colleagues have been open to such discussions, with blockages and surprises in unlikely places: we were taken aback when one geomorphologist for instance voiced publicly his concerns with having to consider the \u2018human\u2019 at all in chronological work (apparently it over-complicates explanation); whereas in a collaborative project with thermal comfort engineers, a much more productive conversation has been possible. Engineers working on sustainable technologies for home construction and retrofitting might not understand the delicacies of relational philosophy (much as we are baffled by the modelling of air flow dynamics), but they appear intuitively open to a conversation that places in situ humans, technologies and such nonhuman entities as a cooling breeze .  If binary frameworks do not provide compelling ontologies, how can we think differently? We may be trapped in the very framing that we seek to overturn, the modernist framing of problems and solutions. What might it mean to think of \u2018causes\u2019 and \u2018solutions\u2019 in terms of association rather than separation? Does decentring the human mean we risk abandoning responsibility? The difficulty of answering these questions is illustrated by recent ecological humanities work on water, mirroring the intellectual impasse on climate change. Take for example the challenges posed by Jessica Weir\u2019s (2009) Murray River Country. Weir argues that \u2018modern\u2019 thinking, which separates nature and culture, is false, \u2018and disables our responses to the ecological devastation we now face in the Murray-Darling Basin\u2019 (p. 3). The crisis in Australia\u2019s largest river system results from historical over-allocation of water for irrigation, together with prolonged drought over the last decade or so, and projected intensification of droughts under climate change. There could hardly be a better candidate for Latour\u2019s notion of an assemblage than the Murray-Darling River system as represented in the Murray-Darling Basin Authority \u2018map\u2019 of weirs, channels, lakes, barrages, reservoirs, pondages, tributaries, channels and tunnels (Weir 2009: 8), and accompanying description of how the river is \u2018run\u2019 from computers in Canberra. Aboriginal people, on the other hand, have \u2018respect for country\u2019 as a main concern. Weir positions the traditional owners, members of the Murray Lower Darling Rivers Indigenous Nations alliance, as \u2018amodern\u2019 in their relations with the non-human world. That is, they are embedded in intimate relationships of mutuality, respect and connection that mix together \u2018human bodies with rivers\u2019, kidneys with lakes (Weir 2009: 13). Importantly, Weir distinguishes amodern from premodern, discussing the way the latter has imprisoned traditional owners in the past. It is in extending this rethinking into the possibilities of river restoration and management that things become more difficult. Weir wants us  8  to be open to an ecological dialogue to facilitate the flow of ideas and the creation of new knowledge for understanding our relationships with the rivers and our responses to river destruction \u2013 otherwise the moderns will continue to deplete, destroy and then depart elsewhere\u2026 to begin their destructive cycle again. (p. 119) The question here is how far amodern thinking gets us along a practical path of healing for the river. As with Whatmore\u2019s (2009) aim to first \u2018slow down\u2019 reasoning as a precursor to thinking rivers differently, the outcomes remain to be seen (although Lane et al. (2011) show that some of the supposed ontological tensions around rivers actually dissolve in the process of collaborative practice).  Amodern thinking may mean we have to accept things we cannot fix, and first grieve appropriately (as Weir suggests in part of her final chapter called \u2018acknowledging ecocide\u2019). We could then move on to living with the new and changed reality, such as that of a dead river. This is surely a tough ask for us moderns \u2013 to concede defeat and stop the eternal busyness around trying to fix things. Does amodern or more-than-human thinking require us to confine ourselves to the possibility of climate change adaptation only, and give up on the modernist aspiration of mitigation? It is our dissatisfaction with such defeatism that leads us to consider what instructive paths can be formed by relational thinking, and what bridges might need to be built between relational epistemologies, physical science and other normative articulations of political change. Whereas relational thinking might provide an exemplary mode of critique, how it takes us towards a decisive political response to climate change is moot. These are considerations that in turn necessitate contemplation on the problematisation of capitalism itself, and the manner in which humans might build other kinds of economies and places as political responses to climate change. It seems necessary to consider the possibility that there may not be solutions, but instead an amalgam of responses that seek to rectify damage done \u2013 a \u2018creative, critical hybridization of existing tools and methods\u2019 (Bridge 2002: 383). We want to resist the conflation of fixing with fixity, if it leads to premature closure and false stability. We see potential to reframe climate change debates away from simplistic discussion of \u2018problems\u2019 and \u2018solutions\u2019 (a typically modernist way of thinking that forever tempts technocentric investment) towards a more uncertain, but lively sense of encounter between humans, things, plants, animals, technology.  To paraphrase Chatterton (2010:234), the climate \u2013 indeed the world \u2013 becomes \u2018an unfinished, expansive and unbounded story\u2019. Shove (2003: 194) has characterised this in a different context by arguing that the \u2018reshaping of practice depends on the conjunction of multiple ingredients\u2019. That amalgam of responses may not cohere philosophically or even logically, and some responses will work better than others \u2013 much is to be debated, tussled and jostled.  9  It is important not to undervalue the active and positive role of deconstructive, relational approaches in rendering visible taken for granted assumptions and relations of power. Nevertheless we believe it is necessary to go further. In a sense the value of such approaches is only half-realised unless we can find pathways to put the world together differently. It is this generative potential that needs to be unlocked.  III Governance, scale and power Relational approaches to scale have been discussed for nearly two decades in geography (Howitt 1993, McGuirk 1997, Marston 2000, Massey 2004), and have added much to the governance debate. Relationality challenges the idea that we can \u2018identify discrete scales from which causes originate and at which effects are felt. In such an approach processes, outcomes, and responses are categorized into distinct \u2018boxes\u2019 that are seen as discrete entities originating at a particular level in an indisputable hierarchy of scales\u2019 (McGuirk 1997: 482). Thus the relationships between scale and order, or scale and causation, should not be assumed but be the subject of empirical enquiry. Gille and O\u2019Riain (2002: 286) make the further point that level of analysis should not be confused with the level of abstraction\u2014the global is not necessarily universal, and the local is not necessarily particular (Hulme 2010a). To say that scale is both socially produced and relational does not deny that particular scales can become fixed, reproduced, and influential.  Bulkeley has argued that until recently, \u2018questions of environment and its governance have remained outside much of this [relational scale] literature\u2019 (2005: 883; see also Norman and Bakker 2009 and Reed and Bruyneel 2010 for recent reviews). One manifestation is the widespread assumption that governance of global environmental issues requires global solutions, which are then \u2018cascaded\u2019 down through national, and implicitly, subnational arenas of governance \u2026This naturalization of the \u2018global\u2019 as the arena in which designated global environmental problems take place effectively serves to disembody the causes and consequences of such problems, and their construction as such, from practices and politics taking place at a multitude of sites and scales of governance. (Bulkeley 2005: 879) A growing literature on governance (of climate change) within and beyond geography has engaged with these issues, using Foucaultian notions of governmentality and power (Oels 2005, L\u00f6vbrand et al. 2009, Okereke et al. 2009). In this understanding, power is not a \u2018resource\u2019 or a \u2018capacity\u2019 possessed by some more than others, but rather is a relationship between actors (Foucault 1982). The problem with the conception of power as \u2018resource\u2019 is that it is essentially \u2018negative\u2019 in character (Foucault 1980), emphasising repression rather than the productive effects of power between actors 10  and across scales of action (effects that might well produce repression as an outcome, but that also create possibilities for resistance). Rather than assume \u2018government\u2019 as a level of formal, ultimate sovereign power existing separate from or \u2018above\u2019 individuals, we would do better to explore how actors employ power in relation to other actors and institutions (and not just human actors, but \u2018the whole ensemble of  human and non-human elements\u2019 (Clark 2011:121)). Apparent devolution of power to smaller geographical scales can then be understood not as a lessening of centralised state power, or a retreat from the modernising ideals of the state. Instead devolution involves a recasting of those who bear the responsibility for action, recruiting citizens (or private companies) as governors of their own actions. Empirical evidence too shows this to be the case. For example, in the context of water governance across the Canada-US border, Norman and Bakker (2009: 112) caution that \u2018scaling down\u2019 does not necessarily lead to increased local empowerment, and can enhance rather than dilute the power of the state: \u2018Rescaling may become a \u201cdownloading\u201d of responsibilities without commensurate power and resources. In some cases, this is accidental; in others, intentional\u2019. Diverse scales and types of \u2018agency beyond the state\u2019 (Stripple and Pattberg 2010) are now recognised, encompassing what we might think of as negative and positive power. They include both the totalising power of big science models and technologies, and globalising governance structures (Oels 2005, L\u00f6vbrand et al. 2009, Hulme 2010). Such approaches help render visible things which are relatively invisible in the \u2018policy architecture\u2019.  Bumpus and Liverman (2008) and Knox-Hayes\u2019 (2010)  for example analyse the calculated construction of carbon markets as means to secure accumulation-by-decarbonisation \u2013 securing the interests of capital and finding new venues for surplus while being seen to be doing something about climate change. Similarly Paterson and Stripple (2010) scrutinise the individual/collective dichotomy in various attempts to \u2018govern\u2019 individual carbon emissions. L\u00f6vbrand and Stripple (2006) discuss two seemingly contradictory spatial tendencies: the \u2018deterritorialisation\u2019 of the global carbon cycle and its \u2018reterritorialisation\u2019 into \u2018national sinks\u2019. The configuration of the carbon cycle into the logic of the state \u2018ties in to a general production of scale in environmental politics\u2019. The net effect is to naturalise a hierarchy of spaces, and \u2018makes it difficult to establish a space of critical engagements in relation to the environment\u2019 (L\u00f6vbrand and Stripple 2006: 235).  On the other hand, a focus on power as processes and procedures rather than organisational entities (Stripple and L\u00f6vbrand 2010) offers a variety of creative possibilities, including a challenge to clear dichotomies of power such as individual/collective and public/private (Stripple and L\u00f6vbrand 2010). It carves out analytical space for environmental/climate change governance that can be characterised as a hybrid between state and non-state actors (Bulkeley 2005). Pushing this even 11  further we can imagine, after Latour\u2019s (1993) idea of a \u2018parliament of things\u2019, polycentric, networked formations of climate governance (Pattberg 2010) \u2018characterized by multiple governing authorities at differing scales\u2019 (Ostrom 2010: 552), in which it is possible to pursue a cosmopolitics (Hulme 2010a, Clarke 2011). Such a cosmopolitics involves extending hospitality to strangers (and not only human ones) in cataclysmic times, generating new forms of community across old geopolitical categories in response to environmental instability. As Clark (2011:216) argues, \u2018programmes are needed \u2013 plans, norms and regulations, networks of resources and knowledge\u2019, but so too must it be possible to reshape governance via a phenomenology of unpredictability and encounter \u2013 being responsive, in other words, to the agency of individual events, to the \u2018episodic stirrings of our earth\u2019 (Clark 2011:214). This thinking is all very new, and itself in the melting pot. Changing forms of power, authority and subjectivity, and re-rendering of old ones, set new research agendas (L\u00f6vbrand et al. 2009).  In contrast to the modernist urge to \u2018fix\u2019 climate change at the global scale, following Massey\u2019s (2004) use of relationality to renew perspectives on the agency of the local, there is increasing interest in the city or the municipality as an innovative arena in which to begin to address global environmental problems (e.g. Bulkeley 2005). Betsill and Bulkeley (2006) review a number of reasons for this. Cities have very high levels of energy consumption and waste production; local governments are well placed to facilitate action and engagement between different stakeholder groups; and cities can have a degree of influence over high proportions of greenhouse gas emissions \u2018in ways that directly impact the ability of national governments to reach targets they have agreed to internationally\u2019 (Betsill and Bulkeley 2006: 143). Rice (2010) elaborates the example of Seattle, USA in doing this. However, Davidson\u2019s (2010) analysis of the way cities can promulgate sustainability as an empty signifier reminds us that there is nothing inherently good about the city (or any other) scale. And the best of this work demonstrates how processes of different scales co-constitute each other (for other recent examples of work at multiple scales see Bickerstaff and Agyeman 2009, Sze et al. 2009 and North 2010).  In this understanding, the \u2018local\u2019 does not just feed into pre-existing scales of something bigger, in accumulative fashion. Rather we can imagine how places might cooperate and collaborate, share and extend hospitality or relations of care, \u2018to be touched, moved, swayed by the plight of strangers\u2019 (Clark 2011:xxi). Gibson-Graham (2008) cite Massey\u2019s (2007) World city on specific examples of \u2018ethical practices of globalization\u2019. These include cultural festivals linking London to Venezuela, and trade-union initiatives on \u2018restitution of the perverse subsidies enjoyed by London\u2019s health system\u2019 (p. 10) as a result of health worker migration to the UK from Ghana. We might imagine similar projects geared around climate change action, which challenge the view of the local as parochial or 12  inhospitable. In the process of everyday life, climate is enrolled necessarily and unavoidably into other concerns, and the local/global churn is evident. So, while we might never have been modern after all, as Latour (1993) suggests, the reconfigured politics we advocate still needs to aim towards a shared, if jostling, global response. Replacing industrial capitalism with other means to meet essential human needs must surely remain a part of this \u2013 a consideration that forces humans to rethink, for instance, how material and intellectual resources are accessed, shared and transferred within and across scales.    IV Generative approaches We argue that the more-than-human turn, and relational approaches to scale, when taken together, can help configure more dynamic cross-scalar responses to climate change and related sustainability issues. Examining how diverse practices and configurations of humans and others are enrolled into the (narrative, structural and technological) architectures of modernity helps to identify and generate new and different pathways. All this is of course much easier said than done. In this section we build on the Gibson-Graham framing of generating alternative possibilities, with particular attention to vernacular capacities, by identifying two productive and connected areas of current work, and suggesting agendas for future development.   Elaborating human and non-human continuities and differences As scholars we need to be eternally vigilant in applying the deconstructive impulse to questions of human difference and power, and the way they are conceptualised in climate change debates. Although it was written before climate change became the most widely discussed ecopolitical issue, Plumwood\u2019s analysis of the deep structures of mastery buried in our intellectual frameworks remains apposite: \u2018There is scarcely a subject or a topic which is not entwined in the knots of dualism these conceptual structures have created\u2019 (1993: 190). Hence, as we saw in the first section of the paper, the story of anthropogenic climate change is one in which the human is dominant and separable. The point is not to get rid of an understanding of human power. Indeed Soper argued that a conceptual distinction between humanity and the rest of nature is a necessary condition of ecopolitics: Unless human beings are differentiated from other organic and inorganic forms of being, they can be made no more liable for the effects of their occupancy of the eco-system than can any 13  other species, and it would make no more sense to call upon them to desist from \u2018destroying\u2019 nature than to call upon cats to stop killing birds. (Soper 1995: 160) Since the time that Soper and Plumwood were writing, both relational social sciences scholarship and scientific research render the distinction rather less clear than either of them argued. Nevertheless, the research agenda is to work out where and under what circumstances the human difference is relevant, and where and under what conditions the privileging of the human is problematic or fanciful. Plumwood\u2019s theory of mutuality which acknowledges both continuity and (non-hierarchical) difference between humans and nonhumans is helpful here, as is Lulka\u2019s (2009) call to de-homogenise the nonhumans. It is also important to pay attention to the variable scales at which human agency and power make more or less of a difference to outcomes for other species (Gaston 2005). This kind of work will enable us to better articulate where and when human effort should be invested, and when to have humility about processes that are beyond our control. As important as it has been over recent decades in drawing attention to our present predicament, the narrative of the inherently destructive human offers little in the way of escape. In terms of generative possibilities, we suggest a role for researchers in assembling more examples of humans contributing to the flourishing of other-than-human life; for example enhancing biodiversity rather than diminishing it (Rival 2006, Stenseke 2004, 2006). If the human condition is one of contingency, then it has capacities to care for the earth as well as destroy it. Studies of prehistoric, non-Western and indigenous cultures have long been important in bringing to light the diversity of ways that human societies can engage with nonhuman world. They are necessary but not sufficient. We suggest two pathways are important. First, we can learn much more from indigenous and non-Western engagements with modernity itself. Examples abound where indigenous and non-Western communities hybridise \u2018tradition\u2019 with \u2018contemporary\u2019 politics. English-speaking social sciences/humanities scholarship has barely begun, for instance, to theorise past and present engagements with modernity in India and China, or sought to move beyond \u2018clich\u00e9d, revivalist or essentialist explanations of the effects of scientific modernity\u2019 (Philip 2004: 3) on non-Western ways of being in the world. For colonised indigenous peoples such hybridisations of \u2018tradition\u2019 and \u2018modern\u2019 are a means to heal the wounds of dispossession and maintain cultural-ecological integrity amidst change. Indigenous communities negotiate \u2018modern\u2019 concerns such as improved health, employment and participation in the co-management of national parks, amongst \u2018pre-colonial\u2019 priorities of ceremony, kinship and caring for country. Such accommodations are not inconsistent. Nor does engaging with the modern state or articulating progressive aspirations necessitate backing away from a politics of decolonisation. In an indigenous worldview, such hybridisations are an entirely logical response in a broken world. This is not about being pre-modern 14  or amodern, but about being differently modern: a living political agenda of decolonisation performed at the community scale, through what Rose (2004:24) describes as \u2018recuperative work\u2019. Our point is not to romanticise indigenous postcoloniality, but to glean from it how such recuperative work reframes temporality, and to learn from examples of how societies have coped with the unimaginable future - catastrophic fracturing of the world as they know it. It is possible to imagine a future consistent in some respects with the past, but that learns from it decisively, in other ways, as means to heal old wounds. Performing recuperative work in response to climate change need not, to use Slater\u2019s (2011: 134) words, \u2018imagine a former time or space of wholeness to return to or a fantasy of a perfect future of completeness\u2019, but instead \u2018by gathering and reassembling the diversity of life, learning to live in and among brokenness\u2019 we might begin to enact a different kind of post-climate change modernity.   Identifying and harnessing vernacular capacities Second, it is imperative that we also document vernacular capacities \u2013 especially where hidden, ignored or taken for granted \u2013 in the cultures of modernity. Attention to the vernacular in this realm also helps understand not only where dualistic nature talk is entrenched, but where more-than-human ontologies are already comprehensible and practised. Much as people might be repulsed by mice in their cupboards, struggle with the water supply or complain about the weather, such encounters intuitively and necessarily entangle humans with non-human others in the course of regular life (Kaika 2005, Power 2009). Researchers in the global North are not only documenting vernacular capacities among various Others, but importantly are recognising them at home, consistent with Gibson-Graham\u2019s approach of imagining alternatives (Cameron and Gibson 2005, Brace and Geoghegan 2011). Research shows a range of cultural capacities in sub/urban households (e.g. Head and Muir, 2007 on backyard water use, Lane et al, 2009 on routes of household reuse and recycling; Gibson and Stanes, 2010 on swapping and sharing clothing). There is much to be learned from migrants\u2019 engagement with environments that have become familiar to older settlers, and from older people who have learned frugality by living with scarcity. This empirical work shows for example that there are problems in conceiving suburbia too simply as space for passive over-consumption, and there are many creative ways in which suburbs are being \u2018retrofitted\u2019.  Moreover, many people (by this we mean non academics) would have no problem conceptualising the contingent, chaotic qualities that attend relationality \u2013 frictions, encounters, contradictions, cogs or thresholds. A ubiquitous example that encapsulates this is the situation where residents wish to do something about climate change, by for instance cycling or more frequently using public 15  transport, but find that they are limited in this by weather, topography, legacies of suburban infrastructure, imperfect routes, networks, timetables and delays. We academics ought not underestimate the extent to which people outside the academy already understand how associations of agency operate to shape everyday decisions and movements, via complex biophysical, political, infrastructural and cultural interactions.  Lest our rendering of alternative scales of climate change mitigation and adaptation be construed as romancing the local, we hasten to emphasise that we are not promoting any simple back to nature approach. Nor do we advocate letting nation states and multinational companies off the hook. Modernity\u2019s relentless growth-oriented track to the future has created a situation where stepping off that track is construed as going backwards. It is important to cut across this linear conflation of sustainability with backwardness and a romanticised localism. Some \u2018backwards\u2019 steps are in fact entirely sensible and forward-thinking \u2013 correctives to the absurdities that creep into everyday habits, as well as a challenge to the invasion of corporate profit-making into the moments and spaces of everyday life. Putting wet washing out on a clothes line instead of using energy-intensive electronic dryers is about making use of an entirely relevant, contemporary technology. It is also a small, but symbolic, act against corporate energy and appliance manufacturers \u2013 an example of Chatterton and Pickerill\u2019s (2010: 475) mundane, yet meaningful, actions in \u2018everyday rhythms\u2019. But nor on the other hand can we likely go \u2018forward\u2019 to highly localized food sources for 7 billion people; it is neither feasible nor the most sustainable way to use resources including soil and water. We are acutely aware from our own research of the many obstacles to embedding sustainability into the politics and everyday practices of affluent urbanised populations (see Gibson et al, 2011; Askew and McGuirk, 2004). In a context where the collective imaginary needs to be extended rather than circumscribed, the research challenge to take the vernacular seriously is an ongoing one, through continuing ethnographic-style research. One gap that needs further work is to extend the focus on frugality and restraint, such as the water and recycling examples mentioned above, to the converse qualities of abundance and excess. How might human needs and desires usually expressed through resource abundance \u2013 hospitality, generosity, celebration \u2013 be met or reconfigured in ways that demand less of the earth? Human cultural diversity is a necessary resource with which to confront such complications.    16  V Conclusion The conceptual and narrative challenge is no less than rewriting, and re-living, \u2018the master story of western culture\u2019 (Plumwood 1993: 196). In a parallel approach to that later developed by Gibson-Graham, Plumwood also argued \u2018we must take into our own hands the power to create, restore and explore different stories, with new main characters, better plots, and at least the possibility of some happy endings\u2019 (p. 196). In this paper we have argued that recent human geography can assist the necessary reconfiguration of modernity through the combination of its deconstructive impulses and empirical compulsions. We have brought together examples from more-than-human geographies and cross-scalar work on agency and governance to illustrate the rather unique possibilities of being both deconstructive and generative/creative. This is not to argue that global solutions will not be necessary. Rather it is to suggest that if they are to emerge, it will be from other modernist sentiments such as cosmopolitanism, compassion, and civility, and through diverse networks of power and practice that as geographers we are accustomed to tracing. Studies of vernacular practice will continue to need critical analysis to understand their contradictions and dilemmas, and the ways individual instances ratchet into broader patterns. We also need to go further in examining how these diverse practices are enrolled into the structural architectures of modernity, in order to identify and generate new and different pathways. The city is one space from which to conceptualise diverse more-than-human others and cross-scalar links \u2013 \u2018up\u2019 to nation-state, and \u2018down\u2019 to household \u2013 within an ever-changing social and economic context, but there are others. Conversely, by bringing into consideration the living more-than-humans we should not deflect attention from the financial more-than-humans \u2013 pension funds, stocks, bonds, securities \u2013 that concurrently exert agency over human affairs. Generative action and agency can go in diverse directions, only some of which will have the necessary wider impact. This invites us to pay particular research attention to how and where power and change flows; for example are there certain kinds of vernacular activities that go no further, compared with those that \u2018scale up\u2019? What is the role of friction points and oppressive power in the former, and how do the latter accumulate? Under what conditions are thresholds \u2013 in either direction \u2013 predictable? The role of intermediaries is important in facilitating the right kinds of connections and in promulgating (and mutating) ideas and knowledge: scientists, solar hot water installers, policy \u2018experts\u2019, neighbours, advocates, newspaper editors. Intermediaries are not all human, but include also things such as switches, technology, energy bills and insurance premiums. We might consider ourselves \u2013 scholars \u2013 as intermediaries who facilitate communication both between disciplines and beyond the academy and hence are charged with the troubled task of explaining complexity but doing so simply (Ang 2006). As Castree (2004:32) recommends this also 17  means overcoming reticence to articulate a bolder sense of normative critique of the \u2018rightness\u2019/\u2019wrongness\u2019 of forms of production and commoditisation.  In critiquing the limitations of modernity we do not advocate laying down all its weapons. Bringing different approaches to climate change requires us still to acknowledge human power, albeit in the company of and in relation to more-than-human others. The historically demonstrated power of human activity lays on us, rather than non-humans, the means and responsibility to work towards solutions \u2013 even after we acknowledge and take seriously the power of non-human things.

Such extreme events ex-\npress more than anything else the underlying \u201cforces\u201d usually hidden by almost perfect balance and thus\n\u2217We acknowledge helpful discussions and exchanges with Y. Malevergne, J.-F Muzy and V. Pisarenko. This work was partially\nsupported by the James S. Mc Donnell Foundation 21st century scientist award/studying complex system.\n1\nprovide the potential for a better scientific understanding of complex systems. These crises have funda-\nmental societal impacts and range from large natural catastrophes such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions,\nhurricanes and tornadoes, landslides, avalanches, lightning strikes, meteorite/asteroid impacts, catastrophic\nevents of environmental degradation, to the failure of engineering structures, crashes in the stock market,\nsocial unrest leading to large-scale strikes and upheaval, economic drawdowns on national and global scales,\nregional power blackouts, traffic gridlock, diseases and epidemics, and so on. It is essential to realize that\nthe long-term behavior of these complex systems is often controlled in large part by these rare catastrophic\nevents [25]. The outstanding scientific question is how such large-scale patterns of catastrophic nature might\nevolve from a series of interactions on the smallest and increasingly larger scales [28], or whether their origin\nshould be searched from exogeneous sources.\nStarting with Hurst\u2019s study of 690 time series records of 75 geophysical phenomena, in particular river flow\nstatistics, documenting the so-called \u201cHurst effect\u201d of long term persistence [10], many studies in the last\ndecades have investigated the existence of long memory effects in a large variety of systems, including me-\nteorology (wind velocity, moisture transfer in the atmosphere, precipitation), oceanography (for instance\nwave-height), plasma turbulence, solar activity, stratosphere chemistry, seismic activity, internet traffic, fi-\nnancial price volatility, cardiac activity, immune response, and so on.\nThe question addressed here is whether the existence of long memory processes may lead to specific sig-\nnatures in the precursory and in the relaxation/recovery/adaptation of a system after a large fluctuation of\nits activity, after a profound shock or even after a catastrophic event, that may allow one to distinguish an\ninternal origin from an exogeneous source. Let us put this question in perspective with regards to the extinc-\ntion of biological species as documented in the fossil record. During the past 550 million years, there have\nbeen purportedly five global mass extinctions, each of which had a profound effect on life on Earth. The\nlast end-Cretaceous mass extinction (with the disappearance of 39\u221247% of fossilizable genera and perhaps\n75% of species) marking the Cretaceous/Tertiary (K/T) boundary about 65 millions ago is often attributed\nto the impact of a huge meteor in the Yucatan peninsula [15]. Another scenario is that a burst of active\nvolcanism was the real origin of the extinction [4, 5]. It has been suggested that this extinction was actually\ndriven by longer-term climatic changes, as evidence by the fact that certain species in the Late Maastrichtian\ndisappeared a distinctive time before the K/T boundary [18, 19]. A completely endogeneous origin has\nalso been proposed, based on the concepts of nonlinear feedbacks between species [20, 1] illustrated by\nself-organized criticality and punctuated equilibria [2, 24] (see [14] for a rebuttal). The situation is even\nmurkier for the extinctions going further in the past, for which the smoking guns, if any, are not observable\n(see however the strong correlation between extinctions and volcanic traps presented in [5]). How can we\ndistinguish between an exogeneous origin (meteorite, volcanism, abrupt climate change) and endogeneous\ndynamics, here defined as the progressive self-organizing response of the network of interacting species that\nmay generate its own demise by nonlinear intermittent negative feedbacks or in response to the accumulation\nof slowly varying perturbations in the environment? Is it possible to distinguish two different exogeneous\norigins, one occurring over a very short time interval (meteorite) and the other extending over a long period\nof time (volcanism), based on the observations of the recovery and future evolution of diversity?\nThe aviation industry provides another vivid illustration of the question on the endogeneous versus exoge-\nneous origin of a crisis. Recently, airlines became the prime industry victim of the September 11, 2001\nterrorist attacks. The impact of the downturn in air travel has been severe not just on the airlines but also on\nlessors and aircraft manufacturers. The unprecedented drop in air travel and airline performance prompted\nthe US government to provide $5 billion in compensation and to make available $10 billion in loan guaran-\ntees. This seems a clear-cut case for an exogeneous shock. However, the industry was deteriorating before\nthe shock of September 11. In the first eight months of 2001, passenger traffic for US carriers rose by an\nanemic 0.7 percent, a sharp fall from annual growth of nearly 4 percent over the previous decade [3], illus-\ntrated by the record levels of the earned profits of $39 billion and of delivery of more than 4,700 jetliners\n2\nfrom 1995 to 2000. The US airlines\u2019 net profits dropped from margins of nearly 4 percent during 1998-2000\nto losses of greater than 3 percent during the first half of 2001, despite aggressive price cuts as airlines tried\nto fill seats and profits vanished.\nMany other examples are available. We propose to address this general question of exogeneous versus\nendogeneous origins of shocks by quantifying how the dynamics of the system may differ in its response to\nan exogeneous versus endogeneous shock. We start with a simple \u201cmean field\u201d model of the activity A(t)\nof a system at time t, viewed as the effective response to all past perturbations embodied by some noisy\nfunction \u03b7(\u03c4),\nA(t) =\n\u222b t\n\u2212\u221e\nd\u03c4 \u03b7(\u03c4) K(t\u2212 \u03c4) , (1)\nwhere K(t \u2212 \u03c4) can be called the memory kernel, propagator, Green function, or response function of the\nsystem at a later time t to a perturbation \u03b7(\u03c4) that occurred at an earlier time \u03c4 . Notwithstanding the linear\nstructure of (1), we do not restrict our description to linear systems but take (1) as an effective coarse-\ngrained description of possible complex nonlinear dynamics. For instance, it has been shown [30] that\nthe extremal nonlinear dynamics of the Bak and Sneppen model and of the Sneppen model of extremal\nevolution of species, which exhibit a certain class of self-organized critical behavior [27], can be accurately\ncharacterized by the stochastic process called \u201cLinear fractional stable motion,\u201d which has exactly the form\n(1) for the activity dynamics.\nExpression (1) contains for instance the fractional Brownian motion (fBm) model introduced by Mandelbrot\nand Van Ness [16] as a simple extension of the memoryless random walk to account for the Hurst effect.\nFrom an initial value BH(0), we recall that the fBm is defined by\nBH(t)\u2212BH(0) = 1\n\u0393(H + (1/2))\n\u222b t\n\u2212\u221e\nd\u03c4 \u03b7(\u03c4) K(t\u2212 \u03c4) , (2)\nwhere d\u03c4 \u03b7(\u03c4) = dW\u03c4 is usually taken as the increment of the standard random walk with white noise\nspectrum and Gaussian distribution with variance E[dW\u03c4 ] = d\u03c4 and the memory kernel K(t \u2212 \u03c4) is given\nby\nK(t\u2212 \u03c4) = (t\u2212 \u03c4)H\u2212 12 , for 0 \u2264 \u03c4 \u2264 t (3)\n= (t\u2212 \u03c4)H\u2212 12 \u2212 (\u2212\u03c4)H\u2212 12 , for \u03c4 < 0 . (4)\nForH > 1/2, the fBmBH(t) exhibits long term persistence and memory, since the effect of past innovations\nof dW\u03c4 is felt in the future with a slowly decaying power law weight K(t\u2212 \u03c4). For our purpose, the fBm is\nnon-stationary and it is more relevant to consider globally statistically stationary processes.\nHere, we consider processes which can be described by an integral equation of the form (1) and (2) but\nwith possibly different forms for the noise innovations \u03b7 and for the memory kernel K . Simple viscous\nsystems correspond to K(t\u2212 \u03c4) \u221d exp[\u2212(t\u2212 \u03c4)/T ], where T is a characteristic relaxation time. Complex\nfluids, glasses, porous media, semiconductors, and so on, are characterized by a memory kernel K(t\u2212 \u03c4) \u221d\ne\u2212a(t\u2212\u03c4)\n\u03b2\n, with 0 < \u03b2 < 1, a law known under the name Kohlrausch\u2013Williams\u2013Watts law [23]. It is also\ninteresting to consider fractional noise motion (fNm) defined as the time derivative of BH(t), which does\npossess the property of statistical stationarity. A fNm is defined by (1) with\nKfNm(t\u2212 \u03c4) = 1\n(t\u2212 \u03c4) 32\u2212H\n=\n1\n(t\u2212 \u03c4)1\u2212\u03b8 , (5)\nfor H = 1/2 + \u03b8. Persistence 1/2 < H < 1 (respectively antipersistence 0 < H < 1/2) corresponds to\n0 < \u03b8 < 1/2 (respectively \u22121/2 < \u03b8 < 0). Such a memory kernel describes also the renormalized Omori\u2019s\nlaw for earthquake aftershocks [26, 8].\n3\n2 Exogeneous versus endogeneous shock\nIn the following, we consider systems described by a long memory integral (1) with kernel K(t) decaying\nfaster than 1/\n\u221a\nt at large times, so as to ensure the condition of statistical stationarity. This excludes the\nfBm which are non-stationary processes but includes the fNm.\n2.1 Exogeneous shock\nAn external shock occurring at t = 0 can be modeled in this framework by an innovation which takes the\nform of a jump A0 \u03b4(\u03c4). The response of the system for t > 0 is then\nA(t) = A0 K(t) +\n\u222b t\n\u2212\u221e\nd\u03c4 \u03b7(\u03c4) K(t\u2212 \u03c4). (6)\nThe expectation of the response to an exogeneous shock is thus\nEexo[A(t)] = A0 K(t) + n\u3008\u03b7\u3009 , (7)\nwhere \u3008\u03b7\u3009 is the average noise level and n = \u222b +\u221e0 d\u03c4 K(\u03c4) is the average impact of a perturbation which\nis usually smaller than 1 to ensure stationarity (this corresponds to the sub-critical regime of branching\nprocesses [7]).\nThe time evolution of the system after the shock is thus the sum of the process it would have followed in\nabsence of shock and of the kernel K(t). The response A0 K(t) to the jump A0 \u03b4(\u03c4) examplifies that K(t)\nis the Green function or propagator of the coarse-grained equation of motions of the system. Expression (6)\nsimply expresses that the recovery of the system to an external shock is entirely controled by its relaxation\nkernel.\n2.2 Endogeneous shock\n2.2.1 Conditional response function\nLet us consider the natural evolution of the system, without any large external shock, which nevertheless\nexhibits a large burst A(t = 0) = A0 at t = 0. From the definition (1), it is clear that a large \u201cendogeneous\u201d\nshock requires a special set of realization of the innovations {\u03b7(t)}. To quantify the response in such case,\nwe recall a standard result of stochastic processes with finite variance and covariance that the expectation of\nsome process X(t) conditioned on some variable Y taking a specific value Y0 is given by [11]\nE[X(t)|Y = A0]\u2212 E[X(t)] = (A0 \u2212 E[Y ]) Cov(X(t), Y )\nE[Y 2]\n, (8)\nwhere E[Y 2] denotes the expectation of Y 2, Cov(X(t), Y ) is the covariance of X and Y , E[X(t)] and\nE[Y ] are the (unconditional) average of X(t) and of Y . Expression (8) recovers the obvious result that\nE[X(t)|Y = A0] = E[X(t)] if X and Y are uncorrelated. A result generalizing (8) holds when \u03b7(\u03c4) has an\ninfinite variance corresponding to a distribution with a power law tail with exponent smaller than 2 [9].\nLet us assume that the process A(t) and the innovations \u03b7\u2019s have been defined with zero mean, which is\nalways possible without loss of generality by a translation. Let us call X(t > 0) = A(t) and Y = A(0).\nUnder the assumption that the noise \u03b7(\u03c4) has a finite variance, we obtain from (1)\nCov(A(t), A(0)) =\n\u222b 0\n\u2212\u221e\nd\u03c4 K(t\u2212 \u03c4)K(\u2212\u03c4) , (9)\n4\nand\nE[A(0)2] =\n\u222b 0\n\u2212\u221e\nd\u03c4 [K(\u2212\u03c4)]2 . (10)\nFor stationary processes such that K(t) decays faster than 1/\n\u221a\nt so as to make the integral in (10) convergent,\nE[A(0)2] is a constant. We thus obtain the posterior (t > 0) response (above the stationary average) to an\nendogenous shock occurring at time t = 0 under the form of a conditional expectation of A(t), conditioned\nby the existence of this shock:\nEendo[A(t)|A(0) = A0] \u221d A0\n\u222b +\u221e\n0\ndu K(t+ u)K(u) , (11)\nfor large A0. This relaxation of the activity after an endogeneous shock is in general significantly different\nfrom that given by (7) following an exogeneous shock.\n2.2.2 Conditional noise trajectory\nWhat is the source of endogeneous shocks characterized by the response function (11)? To answer, let us\nconsider the process W (t) \u2261 \u222b t\u2212\u221e d\u03c4 \u03b7\u02c6(\u03c4), where \u03b7\u02c6(t) = \u03b7(t) \u2212 \u3008\u03b7\u3009 defines the centered innovations\nforcing the system (1). Using the property (8), we find that for t < 0\nEendo[W (t)|A(0) = A0] = Cov[W (t), A(0)]\nVar[A(0)]\n\u00b7 (A0 \u2212 E[A]) \u221d (A0 \u2212 E[A])\n\u222b t\n\u2212\u221e\nd\u03c4 K(\u2212\u03c4) , (12)\nwhere Eendo[W (t)|A(0) = A0] = 0 for t > 0 since the conditioning does not act after the shock. Expression\n(12) predicts that the expected path of the continuous innovation flow prior to the endogeneous shock (i.e.,\nfor t < 0) grows like \u2206W (t) = \u03b7\u02c6(t)\u2206t \u223c K(\u2212t)\u2206t upon the approach to the time t = 0 of the large\nendogeneous shock. In other words, conditioned on the observation of a large endogeneous shock, there is\nspecific set of trajectories of the innovation flow \u03b7(t) that led to it. These conditional innovation flows have\nan expectation given by (12).\nInserting the expression (12) for the average conditional noise in the definition (1) of the process, we obtain\nan expression proportional to (11). This shows that the precursory activity preceding and announcing the\nendogeneous shock follows the same time dependence as the relaxation (11) following the shock, with the\nonly modification that t (for t > 0 counting time after the shock at t = 0) is changed into \u2212t (for t < 0\ncounting time before the shock at t = 0). We can also use (12) into (1) and calculate the activity after the\nendogeneous shock to recover (11). These are two equivalent ways of arriving at the same result, the one\nusing (12) illuminating the fundamental physical origin of the endogeneous response.\nThese results allow us to understand the distinctive features of an endogeneous shock compared to an exter-\nnal shock. The later is a single very strong instantaneous perturbation that is sufficient in itself to move the\nsystem significantly according to (6). In contrast, an \u201cendogeneous\u201d shock is the result of the cumulative ef-\nfect of many small perturbations, each one looking relatively benign taken alone but, when taken all together\ncollectively along the full path of innovations, can add up coherently due to the long-range memory of the\ndynamical process. In summing, the term \u201cendogeneous\u201d is used here to refer to the sum of the contribution\nof many \u201csmall\u201d innovations adding up according to a specific most probable trajectory, as opposed to the\neffect of a single massive external perturbation.\n2.3 Numerical simulation of an epidemic branching process with long-range memory\nTo illustrate our predictions (7) and (11), we use a simple epidemic branching model defined as follows. The\nmodel describes the time evolution of the rate of occurrence of events as a function of all past history. What\n5\nis called \u201cevent\u201d can be the creation of a new species or a new family of organisms as in [6], the occurrence\nof an earthquake as in [26, 8], the amplitude of the so-called financial volatility as in [29] or of aviation\ntraffic, a change of weather regime, a climate shift and so on. The rate \u03bb(t) of events at time t is assumed to\nbe a function of all past events according to\n\u03bb(t) =\n\u2211\ni | ti<t\n\u03c6(t\u2212 ti) , (13)\nwhere the sum is carried over all past events that occurred at times ti prior to the present t. The influence\nof such an event at a previous time ti is felt at time t through the bare propagator \u03c6(t \u2212 ti). In our present\nillustration, we consider a process equivalent to a fNm with Hurst exponent H = 1/2 + \u03b8, which can be\nshown to correspond to the choice \u03c6(t) = \u03b8 c\u03b8/(t + c)1+\u03b8 , where c is an ultra-violet regularization time\nembodying a delay process at early times in the activity response after an event. Indeed, the Master equation\ncorresponding to the process (13) can be shown [26, 8] to be nothing but (1) with the renormalized or dressed\npropagator K(t) \u221d 1/(t+ c)1\u2212\u03b8 .\nNumerical simulations of the epidemic branching process are performed by drawing events in succession\naccording to a non-stationary Poisson process with instantaneous rate (13). Figures 1 and 2 show successive\nmagnifications of time series of the activity rate after an exogeneous shock and around an endogeneous\nshock, respectively, in order to visualize the precursory and relaxation activities. In figure 2, an external\nsource of activity necessary for seeding has been added as a Poisson process of rate \u00b5 = 10\u22123 corresponding\non average to one external event over a time interval of 1000. The most striking visual difference is the\nexistence of the precursory signal occurring at many time scales for the endogeneous shock. Figure 3\nquantifies the precursory and relaxation rates associated with activity shocks. The top panel shows the\nrelaxation of the activity (rate of events) following an external shock compared to that after an endogeneous\nshock, for a single realization. tc is the time of the shock. The horizontal axis is t \u2212 tc for the relaxation\nof the activity after the shock. The precursory activity prior to the shock is also shown for the endogeneous\nshock as a function of tc \u2212 t. The bottom panel shows the same three activity functions after averaging\nover many realizations, translating time in the averaging so that all shocks occur at the same time denoted\ntc. The prediction (7) states that the relaxation of the activity after an exogeneous shock should decay as\nK(t) \u221d 1/(t \u2212 tc + c)1\u2212\u03b8 while the decay after an endogeneous shock should be given by (11) which\npredicts the law \u221d 1/(t \u2212 tc + c)1\u22122\u03b8 , that is, a significantly smaller exponent for \u03b8 > 0. Similarly, we\npredict that the precursory activity prior to an endogeneous shock should increase as \u221d 1/(tc \u2212 t+ c)1\u22122\u03b8 .\nThese predictions are verified with very good accuracy, as seen in figure 3.\nThese simulations confirm that there is a distinctive difference in the relaxation after an endogeneous shock\ncompared to an exogeneous shock, if the memory kernel is sufficiently long-ranged. For a single realization,\nthere are unavoidable fluctuations that may blur out this difference. However, we see a quite visible precur-\nsory signal (foreshock activity) that is symmetric to that relaxation process in the case of an endogeneous\nshock. This follows from the model used here which obeys the time-reversal symmetry. This may be used\nas a distinguishing signature of an endogeneous shock.\n3 Classification of the distinctive responses for different classes of memory\nkernels\nThe family of power law kernels used in the simulations presented in figures 1, 2 and 3 are only one pos-\nsibility among many. Our formalism allows us to classify the distinctive properties of the relaxation and\nprecursory behaviors that can be expected for an arbitrary memory kernel. We now provide this classifica-\ntion by studying (7) and (11).\n6\n3.1 Short-time response\nWe compare the initial slopes of the relaxations after the occurrence of the shock at t = 0. Thus, by\nshort-time, we mean the asymptotic decay law just after the shock. For this, we expand (7) to get\nEexo[A(t)] = A0 K(0)\n[\n1 +\nK \u2032(0)\nK(0)\nt+O(t2)\n]\n= A0 K(0)\n[\n1 +\nd lnK\ndt\n|t=0 t+O(t2)\n]\n, (14)\nwhere K \u2032(t) denotes the derivative of K(t) with respect to time.\nSimilarly, expanding the integral in (11) for short times, we obtain\nEendo[A(t)|A(0) = A0] \u221d A0F (0)\n[\n1 +\n1\n2\nd lnF\ndt\n|t=0 t+O(t2)\n]\n, (15)\nwhere\nF (t) \u2261\n\u222b +\u221e\nt\ndu[K(u)]2 (16)\nis a monotonically decreasing function of time.\nIt is convenient to use the parameterization\nF (t) = e\u2212g(t) , (17)\nwhere g(t) is an monotonously increasing function of time. Inserting (17) in (14) and (15) leads to\nEexo[A(t)] = A0 K(0)\n[\n1\u2212\n(\n1\n2\ng\u2032(0)\u2212 1\n2\ng\u2032\u2032(0)\ng\u2032(0)\n)\nt+O(t2)\n]\n, (18)\nand\nEendo[A(t)|A(0) = A0] \u221d A0F (0)\n[\n1\u2212 1\n2\ng\u2032(0) t+O(t2)\n]\n. (19)\n1. For g\u2032\u2032(0) = 0, that is, g(t) = 2\u03b1t corresponding to an pure exponential relaxation K(t) \u221d exp[\u2212\u03b1t],\nthe velocities of the responses to an exogeneous and to endogeneous shock are identical;\n2. for g\u2032\u2032(0) > 0 corresponding to a super-exponential relaxation K(t) \u221d exp[\u2212\u03b1tc] with c > 1, the\nexogeneous relaxation is slower than the endogeneous one;\n3. for g\u2032\u2032(0) < 0 corresponding to a sub-exponential relaxation such as a stretched exponential K(t) \u221d\nexp[\u2212\u03b1tc] with c < 1 or to the family of regularly varying functions such as power laws, the exoge-\nneous relaxation is faster than the endogeneous one.\nThe exponential relaxation thus marks the boundary between two opposite regimes. As is intuitive, a sub-\nexponential relaxation betraying a long memory process leads to a slower short-time recovery after an en-\ndogeneous shock, because it results from a long preparation process (12).\n3.2 Asymptotic long-time response\nSince K(t) is a monotonously decaying function, K(t + u) \u2264 K(t) for any u \u2265 0. This leads to the\nfollowing inequality\nEendo[A(t)|A(0) = A0] \u2264 A0K(t)\n\u222b +\u221e\n0\ndu K(u) , (20)\n7\nwhich is valid if the integral\n\u222b +\u221e\n0 du K(u) exists, that is, if K(t) decays faster than 1/t at large times. This\nshows that, as soon as K(t) \u226a C/t for any positive constant C , Eendo[A(t)|A(0) = A0] < Eexo[A(t)].\nBut the difference may be small and inobservable. For instance, for K(t) \u221d 1/t1+\u03b8 with \u03b8 > 0, a careful\nexamination of the integral in (11) shows that, due to the contribution of the conditional noise close to the\nshock, we have\nEendo[A(t)|A(0) = A0] \u221d A0\nt1+\u03b8\n\u223c Eexo[A(t)] . (21)\nThus, there is no qualitative difference in the relaxation rates of an endogeneous shock and exogeneous shock\nin this case: the contributions of all the conditional activity prior to the endogeneous shock is equivalent to\nthat of the shock itself. A more elaborate and analysis specific to the problem at hand must be performed to\npredict the prefactors that will be different in the endogeneous and exogeneous cases.\nIn constrast, for memory kernels K(t) \u221d 1/t1\u2212\u03b8 with \u03b8 > 0 decaying slower than 1/t, as for a stationary\nfNm of the form (5), we obtain\nEendo[A(t)|A(0) = A0] \u221d A0\nt1\u22122\u03b8\n\u226b Eexo[A(t)] \u221d A0\nt1\u2212\u03b8\n. (22)\nIn this case, the relaxation following an endogeneous shock decays significantly more slowly than for an\nexogeneous shock. This case is examplified in figure 3. In the long time limit, the decay law 1/t thus marks\nthe boundary between two opposite regimes.\n3.3 Illustration\nAn illustration of this critical behavior is provided by the response of the price volatility \u03c3\u2206t at scale \u2206t\ndefined as the amplitude (absolute value) of the return rDt(t) \u2261 ln[p(t)/p(t \u2212 \u2206t)] = \u01eb(t) \u00b7 \u03c3\u2206t(t) =\n\u01eb(t) \u00b7 e\u03c9\u2206t(t). of a financial asset. \u01eb(t) is a random sign. Indeed, financial price time series have been shown\nto exhibit a long-range correlation of their log-volatility \u03c9\u2206t, described by a model [22, 29] in which \u03c9\u2206t(t)\nfollows the process (1) with\nK\u2206t(t) \u223c K0\n\u221a\n\u03bb2T\nt\nfor \u2206t\u226a t\u226a T , (23)\nwhere T \u2248 1 year is a so-called integral time scale. This form (23) corresponds to the parameterization (5)\nwith \u03b8 = 1/2. Sornette et al. [29] have shown that there is a clear distinction between the relaxation of stock\nmarket volatility after an exogeneous event such at the September 11, 2001 attack or the Aug., 19, 1991\ncoup against Gorbachev and that after an endogeneous event such as the October 19, 1987 crash. In this\nmodel, the long-range memory acting on the logarithm of the volatility induces an additional effect, namely\nthe exponent of the power law relaxation after an endogeneous shock is a linear function of the amplitude\nof the shock.\n3.4 Synthesis of the asymptotic short- and long-time regimes\nWe have found two special functional forms for the response kernel K(t) \u221d 1/t and K(t) \u221d exp[\u2212\u03b1t],\nwhich are \u201cinvariant\u201d or indifferent with respect to the endogeneous versus exogeneous origin of a shock.\nThus, for normal exponential relaxation processes as well as for power relaxation \u221d 1/t, the functional form\nof the recovery does not allow one to distinguish between an endogeneous and an exogeneous shock.\nThese two invariants K(t) \u221d exp[\u2212\u03b1t] and K(t) \u221d 1/t delineate two opposite regimes, the first one for\nshort-time scales and the second one for long-time scales:\n8\n1. for K(t) \u221d 1/t1\u2212\u03b8 with \u03b8 > 0, the endogeneous response decays more slowly than the exogeneous\nresponse, at all time scales;\n2. for exp[\u2212\u03b1t]\u226a K(t)\u226a 1/t for any positive \u03b1, the endogeneous response decays more slowly than\nthe exogeneous response at short time scales and has the same dependence as the exogeneous response\nat long time scales; this regime describes for instance the stretched exponential relaxation of complex\nfluids alluded to above;\n3. for K(t)\u226a exp[\u2212\u03b1t] for any positive \u03b1, the endogeneous response decay faster than the exogeneous\nresponse at all time scales.\nMore complicated behaviors can occur when the memory kernel K(t) exhibits a change of regime, crossing\nthe exponential and/or 1/t boundaries at certain time scales. Each situation requires a specific analysis\nwhich yields sometimes surprising non-intuitive results [9].\n4 Conclusion\nWe think that the conceptual framework presented here may be applied to a large variety of situations,\nbeyond those alluded to in the introduction. For instance, the result (12) has been shown to explain the\nso-called inverse Omori\u2019s law for earthquake foreshock activity before a mainshock, in a simple model of\nearthquake triggering [9]. The same mechanism may explain the premonitory seismicity pattern known as\n\u201cburst of aftershocks\u201d [13]: a mainshock with an abnormally large number of aftershocks has been found to\nbe a statistically significant precursor to strong earthquakes [21].\nMany dynamical systems in Nature, such as geophysical and biological systems (immune network, memory\nprocesses in the brain, etc.), or created by man such as social structures and networks (Internet), States\nand so on, exhibit long-memory effects due to a wealth of possible mechanisms. For instance, Krishan\nKhurana at UCLA has suggested to us that the concept proposed here could explain that endogeneous civil\nwars have long-lasting effects with slow reconstruction compared with the fast recovery after exogeneous\nwars (that is, imposed or coming from the outside). The increasing emphasis on the concepts of emergence\nand complexity has emphasized an endogeneous origin of the complicated dynamical behavior of complex\nsystems. In reality, most (so-called) complex systems are the result of their internal dynamics/adaptation\nin response to a flow of external perturbations, but some of these external perturbations are rare extreme\nshocks. What is the role of these exogeneous shocks in the self-organization of a complex system? Can\none distinguish the impact of extreme exogeneous shocks from an endogeneous organization at different\ntime scales? Our present analysis has just scratched the surface of these important and deep questions by\nsuggesting an angle of attack based on the conditional historical process at the basis of strong endogeneous\nfluctuations. Extensions of the present simplified framework involve the generalization to multidimensional\ncoupled processes such as in [12] and to nonlinear spatio-temporal processes.\nWe are grateful to A.B.

Persistent social \nproblems\u2014poverty, food insecurity, climate change, drug addiction, \npollution, and the list goes on\u2014seem aptly condemned as wicked. But \nwhat makes them wicked, and what are we to do about them? \nThe concept of wicked problems as something more than a \ngeneric description has its origins in the late 1960s. Professor Horst \nRittel of the University of California, Berkeley, Architecture \nDepartment posed the term in a seminar to describe \u201cthat class of social \nsystem problems which are ill-formulated, where the information is \nconfusing, where there are many clients and decision makers with \nconflicting values, and where the ramifications in the whole system are \nthoroughly confusing.\u201d1 Rittel and his colleague Melvin Webber later \nrefined the concept in a 1973 publication, Dilemmas in a General Theory \nof Planning,2 in which they developed their now-famous list of ten \ndistinguishing properties of wicked problems:  \n \n1. There is no definitive formulation of a wicked problem.  \n2. Wicked problems have no stopping rule. \n3. Solutions to wicked problems are not true-or-false, but good-\nor-bad. \n4. There is no immediate and no ultimate test of a solution to a \nwicked problem. \n5. Every solution to a wicked problem is a \u201cone-shot operation\u201d; \nbecause there is no opportunity to learn by trial-and-error, \nevery attempt counts significantly.  \n6. Wicked problems do not have an enumerable (or \nexhaustively desirable) set of potential solutions, nor is there \na well-described set of permissible operations that may be \nincorporated into the plan.  \n7. Every wicked problem is essentially unique. \n \n 1. C. West Churchman, Wicked Problems, 14 MGMT. SCI. B-141, B-141 (1967) (describing \nRittel\u2019s seminar discussion).

Every wicked problem can be considered to be a symptom of \nanother problem.  \n9. The existence of a discrepancy representing a wicked \nproblem can be explained in numerous ways. The  \nchoice of explanation determines the nature of the  \nproblem\u2019s resolution.  \n10.

The vast majority of the publications citing \nRittel and Webber\u2019s article do so simply to adopt the concept of wicked \nproblems, with a quick sentence or two about what Rittel and Webber \nhad in mind about wickedness (often with The List set out), to fit the \nproblem under consideration into that category of social problems.8 It is \nas if without the prefix \u201cwicked\u201d a problem is not worthy of  \nscholarly attention.  \nThis is overwhelmingly the pattern in legal scholarship: the \nauthor claims a social problem is a wicked problem, cites Rittel and \nWebber, and that is the last we hear of them and of the concept. Only \non rare occasion do legal scholars leverage Rittel and Webber more \ncomprehensively, and even then it is usually to crunch through the ten \ncharacteristics rather than engage their broader commentary on the \nchallenges of modern governance.9 The small subset of articles \ngrappling with the wicked problems concept as part of a theory of \ngovernance appears mainly in policy science and planning journals.10  \nThe purpose of this Article is to close that gap\u2014to provide in \nlegal scholarship a concise summary of wicked problems theory from its \nroots in Rittel and Webber\u2019s article through its evolution in policy \nscience and planning scholarship. Not coincidentally, this sets the stage \nfor introducing the theme of the Vanderbilt Law Review\u2019s 2019 \nSymposium, Governing Wicked Problems, and the other articles in this \nSymposium issue.  \nThe Symposium explored three key questions: Where do we go \nfrom here with wicked problems theory? Is there anything to be learned \nabout governing wicked problems from governance theories that have \ngained traction since Rittel and Webber\u2019s article, such as resilience \ntheory and adaptive governance theory? What insights are there for \nwicked problems in the twenty-first century, such as climate change, \nbiodiversity loss, evolving technologies, and lack of affordable urban \nhousing, which all seem to be rapidly increasing in their \u201cwickedness\u201d? \nWe develop these themes in four parts. Part I of the Article goes \nback to the roots of wicked problems theory to unpack what Rittel and \n \n 8. As one commentary puts it, many references to the article \u201centail little more than \nnamedropping a buzzword to attract attention.\u201d Termeer et al., supra note 4, at 176. \n 9.

IRVINE L. REV. 1181 (2019) (arguing that balancing privacy \nand security concerns in regard to the accessibility of encrypted data is a wicked problem). \n 10. See infra Parts II and III (discussing the first and second generations of wicked problems \ntheory literature). \n        \n2020] GOVERNING WICKED PROBLEMS 1565 \nWebber had to say about governance of social problems in the latter \nstages of the twentieth century. Part II traces the evolution of wicked \nproblems theory over the following forty years under three broad \ncategories: refinements to the original theory, extensions of the original \ntheory, and critiques. Part III describes the \u201csecond generation\u201d of the \ntheory, examining how the modern theories of complexity science and \nevolving governance systems sharpen our understanding of wicked \nproblems scholarship. Part IV provides summaries of the contributions \nto this Symposium issue. \nWhether called \u201cwicked\u201d or not, there is a growing sense that the \nsocial problems of our future are rapidly growing more complex. \nReaching global scales, they are increasingly fragile to cascade failure. \nIntertwined in vast social-ecological-technological systems, they seem \nout of control. This Symposium issue was convened with the clear \nunderstanding that new ways of thinking about social problems and \ntheir governance are needed now more than ever.    \nI. THE ROOTS OF WICKED PROBLEMS THEORY \nThe wicked problems concept is about more than a list of ten \nmaddening features of complex social problems. Rittel and Webber were \nwriting in the early 1970s, which witnessed rising polarization in \nAmerican politics in realms such as the environment, the military, \nurban renewal, women\u2019s rights, welfare, policing, and race relations.11 \nAs planners, they were focused on the changing role and status of the \nbroader class of professionals in society, which they saw as in transition \nfrom solving definable, understandable, and consensual social problems \nto hammering away at problems mired in contested goal formulation, \nproblem definition, and equity issues.12 The tools and competencies \nprofessionals used to solve the \u201ctame\u201d problems of prior eras drew from \nscientific methods, rational choice inquiry, operations research, and \nefficiency analysis, and their successes with these tools elevated the \nstature of professionals and their methods.13 It was an impressive \nrecord. As Rittel and Webber put it, the streets had been paved, roads \nconnected, housing built, dread diseases controlled, clean water \n \n 11. Rittel & Webber, supra note 2, at 155\u201356. \n 12.

First, with the \u201ctame\u201d problems \nsolved, there was growing social awareness that not nearly as much \nprogress had been made on problems that were more complex and \nsystemic. Second, these kinds of problems exposed a \u201cgrowing \nawareness of the nation\u2019s pluralism and of the differentiation of values \nthat accompanies differentiation of publics.\u201d16 These two forces led to \nmore and more societal process having \u201cthe character of zero-sum \ngames. As the population becomes increasingly pluralistic, inter-group \ndifferences are likely to be reflected as inter-group rivalries of the zero-\nsum sorts.\u201d17  \nAs a consequence, professionals were becoming less successful \nat solving problems, or even at satisfying most clients that they were \nmaking progress. Whereas \u201ctests for efficiency . . . were once so useful \nas measures of accomplishment,\u201d they were being replaced \u201cby a \nrenewed preoccupation with consequences for equity.\u201d18 The \n\u201cinteracting open systems\u201d in which emerging complex social problems \noperated were increasingly resistant to \u201cthe professionalized cognitive \nand occupational styles that were refined in the first half of [the \ntwentieth] century.\u201d19 In short, as national consensus on social goals \nand the problems facing them eroded, professionals found themselves \nin a moment of crisis. \nAlmost fifty years later, what are our nation\u2019s goals today? What \nare the problems we face? What are professionals supposed to do about \nthem? Is there more consensus on those questions today than when \nRittel and Webber wrote in 1973? That is, of course, intended as a \nrhetorical question. There is no societal consensus on our problems or \nsolutions. This would have come as no surprise to Rittel and Webber, \nwho have proven to be quite prescient in their take on the role of \n \n 14. Id. at 156. \n 15. Id. at 155. \n 16. Id. at 156. \n 17.

As planners, Rittel and Webber had in mind the academic debate underway at the \ntime over \u201cthe rational choice assumptions embedded in comprehensive planning approaches to \nsocietal problems.\u201d Termeer et al., supra note 4, at 170. \n        \n2020] GOVERNING WICKED PROBLEMS 1567 \nprofessionals in governance. They predicted this state of affairs in their \nassessment of goal formulation, problem definition, and the modern \n\u201copen systems\u201d social context of wicked problems. \nA. Goal Formulation \nRittel and Webber characterize goal finding as one of the central \nfunctions of planning and policy,20 suggesting that \u201cthe search for \nexplicit goals was initiated in force with the opening of the 1960s.\u201d21 \nIndeed, they make reference to President Eisenhower\u2019s 1960 \nCommission on National Goals, which identified fifteen goals as \nobjectively the right goals.22 That was the first and last such \ncommission. Rittel and Webber argued that with the rising pluralism \nin Western democracies, that kind of \u201c[g]oal-finding is turning out to be \nan extraordinarily obstinate task.\u201d23 American optimism in progress \nand the goodness of the social order was eroding, yet the planning and \nother social professions refused to concede that \u201cplanning for \nbetterment\u201d was becoming impossible when the nation could not agree \nabout what was better.24 Objective social indicators, reasoning, rational \ndiscourse, and civilized negotiation were becoming more difficult to find \nand apply as tools for defining goals for perfecting the future. \nOf course, one has to ask what exactly was \u201cthe nation\u201d that was \nsetting goals in 1960, when Rittel and Webber say it was easier to \nachieve consensus. Every member of the Commission on National Goals \nwas a white male.25 It was ostensibly nonpartisan, but the members \nwere of only mildly diverse political and socioeconomic orientations.26 \nIndeed, in their references to planners and professionals, Rittel and \n \n 20.

The population did not change \nnearly as much as the politics. Yet, notwithstanding their limited \nworldview, Rittel and Webber identified the problem with goal \nformulation\u2014it became really hard. It has not gotten any easier.   \nB. Problem Definition \nAccording to Rittel and Webber\u2019s \u201cwhen planning was easy\u201d \nnarrative, when the Commission on National Goals was doing its work \nand its goals were (to them) clear, efficiency was seen as both the \nexplanation for and solution to social problems.30 Problems arose where \nefficiency was lacking, and solutions were designed around efficient \nmeasures that the technically skilled professional could implement \nwith the simplified end in mind.31 Why was this perspective  \nalso unravelling?  \nFor Rittel and Webber, problem definition requires \u201cknowing \nwhat distinguishes an observed condition from a desired condition.\u201d32 \nTheir perceived rise in pluralism made it more difficult to identify \ndesired positions, but as social problems increasingly operated in \n\u201cinterconnected networks of systems,\u201d it became just as difficult to \nidentify observed conditions with any certainty.33 Under those \nconditions, even if desired ends are agreed, planners cannot easily \nlocate \u201cwhere in the complex causal networks the trouble really lies.\u201d34 \nIndeed, to a large extent Rittel and Webber attribute this growing \nproblem with problem definition to be the result of planners becoming \nmore aware of the problems they were being asked to solve. As they put \nit, \u201cas we become more sophisticated about the complex workings of \nopen societal systems, it becomes ever more difficult to make the \nplanning idea operational.\u201d35    \n \n 27.

Open Systems \nWhen one reads the wicked problems literature, it is easy to get \nthe impression that Rittel and Webber simply put The List out there \nwithout the foregoing context on the erosion of goal formulation and \nproblem definition in modern governance. As Termeer et al. suggest, \n\u201c[t]he 10 claims made by Rittel and Webber can . . . be read as a set of \narguments against purely rational approaches to policy. In the \nsubsequent literature, however, these claims have largely been picked \nup as defining characteristics of a particular type of policy \nproblems . . . .\u201d36 Perhaps it is better to think of them as both. In \nelaborating on each of the claims, Rittel and Webber devote \nconsiderable attention to what makes a problem \u201cwicked\u201d as opposed to \n\u201ctame,\u201d yet there is no mistaking that their purpose is to challenge \nrationalism as the method of professionals\u2019 problem-solving.  \nTo a large extent, The List is self-explanatory with regard to \neach characteristic\u2014the elaborations and examples Rittel and Webber \nprovide in the article are for the most part just that. One gets the gist \nof the concept just by reading The List. Stepping back, however, one \ntheme dominates throughout the full article as defining both the core \ncharacteristic of wicked problems and the core challenge to rationalist \ngovernance\u2014the open system property of wicked problems. Indeed, \nbefore getting to The List, Rittel and Webber devote a full page of the \narticle to their argument that \u201cthe classical paradigm of science and \nengineering\u2014the paradigm that has underlain modern \nprofessionalism\u2014is not applicable to the problems of open societal \nsystems.\u201d37 The List, then, is their attempt to define why those open \nsystems defy that problem-solving paradigm.  \nEvery one of the characteristics of a wicked problem Rittel and \nWebber describe thus is an extension or consequence of their conception \nof social problems as operating in \u201clarge and interconnected networks \nof systems.\u201d38 This is why \u201cany solution, after being implemented, will \ngenerate waves of consequences,\u201d some of which could \u201cyield utterly \nundesirable repercussions which outweigh the intended advantages\u201d of \nthe solution.39 Ultimately, \u201c[t]he planner who works with [such] open \nsystems is caught up in the ambiguity of their causal webs.\u201d40  \nIt is this overarching property of wicked problems that Rittel \nand Webber use in the final part of their article to return to their \n \n 36.

Political and professional elites just did not see them that way. \nGoals for all of society were defined by a narrow band of society and in \nsuch a way as to be amenable to technocratic solution actions. \nRegardless, the message Rittel and Webber sent to social professionals \ngoing forward\u2014that those days were over\u2014was not only on target then, \nbut also prescient regarding our present social context.    \nThe roots of wicked problems theory thus go deeper than The \nList. Rittel and Webber formulated the concept of a wicked problem to \nexpose a transition in the methods and metrics of governance from a \nrationalist obsession with efficiency to a pluralistic debate over equity. \nAt the end of the day, however, the article proved an anticlimax. The \nauthors had no answers for how to move forward, conceding they had \n\u201cneither a theory that can locate societal goodness, nor one that might \ndispel wickedness, nor one that might resolve the problems of equity \nthat rising pluralism is provoking.\u201d44 Those theories remain elusive, to \nsay the least. \nII. THE FIRST GENERATION OF WICKED PROBLEMS THEORY \nAlthough many of the citations to Rittel and Webber simply \nattribute the source of The List, there are also more than enough \npublications delving into the meaning of the wicked problems concept \nas a class of problems and its implications for governance.45 Early \u201cfirst \ngeneration\u201d contributions generally fell into three categories\u2014\nrefinements of The List, extensions of The List and its governance \n \n 41.

As a recent \nsurvey concluded, however, \u201c[d]espite many new insights, the 10 \ncharacteristics of Rittel and Webber still dominate the debate.\u201d46 \nNevertheless, it is worth identifying some of the more prominent entries \nin the continuing debate. \nA. Refinements \nLess than a decade after its publication, Rittel and Webber\u2019s \narticle was already being described as \u201cthe seminal article\u201d on \nintractable social problems.47 Yet, stepping back from it, The List is a \nbit of a jumble, lacking any readily apparent basis for the order and \nnumber of the attributes. Refinements thus followed in the literature. \nOne early and useful such contribution, by Bayard Catron, \ninsightfully reorganized the ten attributes around four sets of claims \nhaving to do with wicked problems: (1) the ontology (their existence), \n(2) the epistemology (our ability to understand), (3) the methodology \n(how we approach them), and (4) the ethics (acting rightly).48 Under this \nrubric, The List would be reorganized as follows:   \n \nOntological claims \n1.  There is no definitive formulation of a wicked problem.  \n7. Every wicked problem is essentially unique. \n8. Every wicked problem can be considered to be a symptom of \nanother problem.  \nEpistemological claims \n6.  Wicked problems do not have an enumerable (or \nexhaustively desirable) set of potential solutions, nor is there \na well-described set of permissible operations that may be \nincorporated into the plan.  \n9.  The existence of a discrepancy representing a wicked \nproblem can be explained in numerous ways. The  \nchoice of explanation determines the nature of the  \nproblem\u2019s resolution.  \nMethodological claims \n2.  Wicked problems have no stopping rule. \n4.  There is no immediate and no ultimate test of a solution to a \nwicked problem. \n \n 46. Termeer et al., supra note 4, at 170. \n 47. Bayard L.

Solutions to wicked problems are not true-or-false, but good-\nor-bad. \n5.  Every solution to a wicked problem is a \u201cone-shot operation\u201d; \nbecause there is no opportunity to learn by trial-and-error, \nevery attempt counts significantly.  \n10.  The planner has no right to be wrong. \n \nOther efforts to categorize the ten attributes include one \ndividing them into problem-related attributes (claims 1, 6, 7, 8, and 9) \nand solution-related attributes (claims 2, 3, 4, and 5), another focusing \non indeterminacy and irreversibility, and another dividing them into \nclaims of complexity, diversity, and uncertainty.49 Despite these \nvaluable insights, The List persists in its original order and number \nand is invariably the first version to be referenced by most authors, if \nany others are mentioned at all. \nA different and more influential approach, by John Alford and \nBrian Head, focuses on the degree of wickedness using dimensions of \nthe wicked problem concept.50 They divide the wicked problems concept \ninto two problems: increasing complexity of the problem and solution, \nand increasing difficulty of achieving stakeholder cooperation.51 \u201cTame \nproblems\u201d operate when those dimensions are at their easiest to \nachieve, and \u201cvery wicked problems\u201d are at the opposite extreme, with \nvarious descriptions of complexity fitting in other boxes of their \nmatrix.52 Factors driving problems along the spectrum include \nstructural complexity, knowability, knowledge fragmentation, \nknowledge framing, interest differentiation, and power distributions.53 \nThis approach proves useful in two respects. First, it goes \u201cbeyond the \ndichotomous analytical framing of wicked versus tame problems\u201d;54 and \nsecond, their driver factors offer some explanatory power for assessing \nwhy wicked problems have the attributes captured in The List.   \n \n 49.

Extensions \nSeveral influential contributions to the wicked problems \nliterature take The List as a given and extend attributes or theory from \nthere. Perhaps the most popularized example, by Kelly Levin et al., is \nthat of \u201csuper wicked problems.\u201d55 Focusing on climate change, they \nappend to The List four additional attributes to define a new class of \nproblems: (1) time is running out; (2) those who cause the problem also \nseek to provide a solution; (3) the central authority needed to address \nthem is weak or nonexistent; and (4) irrational discounting occurs that \npushes responses into the future.56 These features aptly describe the \nclimate change problem.57 But Levin et al. spend little time elaborating \non them; rather, they develop an insightful theory of forward-looking, \npath-dependent policy interventions designed to overcome the four \nsuper-wicked attributes.58 Having hitched their list to The List, \nhowever, their governance theory has to a large extent suffered the \nsame fate as Rittel and Webber\u2019s original work\u2014they are cited mainly \nfor their list, far less so for their theory.59   \nAnother frequently cited contribution, by Nancy Roberts, \nleverages Alford and Head\u2019s wickedness spectrum concept to develop a \ntheory of \u201ccoping strategies\u201d for wicked problems.60 If conflict over both \nproblem definition and its solution become high, thus fitting the wicked \nproblems class (what Roberts calls Type III problems), Roberts suggests \nthree possible governance approaches.61 If power over the solution is \ncentralized rather than dispersed (which per Levin et al. would \ndisqualify it from being a super wicked problem), authoritative \nstrategies can be developed. If power over the solution is dispersed but \nnot contested, collaborative strategies can be employed to reach \nsolutions. If power is both dispersed and contested, solutions must be \ndevised and vetted in competitive strategies, such as politics  \nand markets.    \n \n 55.

Critiques come in two forms\u2014critiques of the concept \nitself and critiques of its use in the literature. \nA recurrent theme in scholarship critiquing Rittel and Webber \ndirectly is that their tame/wicked dichotomy relies on a \u201cstrict, \nontological demarcation of wicked and tame problems according to the \nbranches of science [that] is a serious misconception, and as such very \nmisleading.\u201d62 Rittel and Webber did (it seems unnecessarily for their \npurposes) diminish the challenges of the kind of problems the natural \nand engineering sciences solve, which they describe as definable, \nseparable, findable, and thus \u201ctame\u201d in comparison to the wicked \nproblems planners and other social science professionals confront.63 \nEven very early and generally favorable reviews of their article fault \nthem for this oversimplification.64 Their central point was that planners \nshould stop \u201cmimicking the cognitive style of science and the \noccupational style of engineering.\u201d65 For that, they did not need to \nportray the natural sciences and engineering as confined to tame (albeit \noften very complicated) problems.    \nAnother criticism of Rittel and Webber is that, although they \ndescribe the class of wicked problems as part of their \u201cinvocation for a \ncommunity of rationalistic researchers to critically reflect on their \nparadigm,\u201d66 they provided no coherent research program for going \nforward. But is this a fair criticism? After all, the title of the article, \nDilemmas in a General Theory of Planning, suggests that it was the \ninvocation that was their central purpose, not charting a research \nagenda for policy studies. Again, The List seems to have hijacked their \ntheory of governance and become the larger focus of such critiques. \nThis rings true in the stream of criticism aimed at scholars \nleveraging the wicked problems concept. For example, Guy Peters \ncomplains that \u201cdescribing . . . policy problems as wicked problems has \nbecome a fad in the academic literature,\u201d whereas there is in fact a \n\u201cpaucity of problems that meet [the] full definition of a wicked \nproblem.\u201d67 Peters also objects that \u201cthe concept of wicked problems has \n \n 62.

THE SECOND GENERATION OF WICKED PROBLEMS THEORY \nRecent wicked problems literature reveals an emerging \u201csecond \ngeneration\u201d of thought about both the governance challenge Rittel and \nWebber described and the conception of wicked problems.72 For \nexample, some scholars posit that complexity science can help inform \nconceptions of wicked problems.73 The focus of complexity science is \ncomplex adaptive systems\u2014systems \u201cin which large networks of \ncomponents with no central control and simple rules of operation give \nrise to complex collective behavior, sophisticated information \nprocessing, and adaptation via learning or evolution.\u201d74 One dominant \nattribute of complex adaptive systems is feedback between the system \ncomponents\u2014the connections through which information flows \nbetween them to trigger responses.75 \u201cAnother important property, \ndriven largely by intercomponent feedback, is emergence, the core idea \nof which is that the system exhibits macroscopic behavior that could not \nbe predicted by examining the system components, interconnections, \nand interactions at microscopic scales.\u201d76 \u201cA third central property of \n \n 68.

Alas, they \nalso make understanding system behavior\u2014and even more so \npredicting it\u2014excruciatingly difficult.  \nAlthough Rittel and Webber wrote before the development of \ncomplexity science and its terminology, their article is replete with \nconceptions of governing \u201copen system\u201d problems that resonate directly \nin complexity science.

The articles in this \nSymposium issue tap into these themes, exploring how both new \ntheories of governance and new kinds of wicked (and super wicked) \nproblems can contribute to that end.  \nIV. THE NEXT GENERATION OF WICKED PROBLEMS THEORY \nTwelve leading scholars contributed to this Symposium. While \nall the articles address both theory and practice, their focus falls into \ntwo groups. Robin Craig, Barbara Cosens and coauthors, and Scott \nCampbell and Moira Zellner focus on how systems theories that have \ndeveloped since 1970 change how we analyze wicked problems. Their \npieces describe the application of resilience theory, complexity theory, \ncausal loop analysis, and ecological panarchy, among others, to the \nchallenges posed by wicked problems. Taken together, these provide a \nsuperb description of cutting-edge theory.  \nThe second group applies wicked problems theory to the specific \nchallenges of climate change, biodiversity loss, zoning, and emerging \ntechnologies. Interestingly, they all reject core features of the classic \nwicked problems analysis and certain parts of The List. Richard \nLazarus, Gary Marchant, Alejandro Camacho, Michael Vandenbergh \nand Jonathan Gilligan, and Christopher Serkin call for variants of \nadaptive management, muddling through, or \u201csilver buckshot\u201d \nstrategies rather than silver bullets.  \n \n 83.

Wicked Problem Theories \nIn Designing Law to Enable Adaptive Governance of Modern \nWicked Problems,86 Barbara Cosens and her coauthors explore the role \nof law and government in adaptive governance. Starting from the \nscholarship in systems thinking, the piece argues that framing wicked \nproblems as the result of open and interacting systems represents a \nmajor advance from Rittel and Webber\u2019s more linear scientific \napproach. In particular, they describe the essential facets of complexity \ntheory, arguing that seven features of complex systems are the driving \nforces behind modern wicked problems. The article ends with a rejection \nof the traditional strategies of centralized command and control or \nreliance on markets in the face of increasing complexity. The authors \nmake a pragmatic call for a \u201cnew governance\u201d based on greater \ndistributed self-organization through networked governance  \nand collaborative governance. They end with specific examples of  \nhow law and policy can reinforce new governance through  \nadaptive management.    \nRobin Craig provides a historical perspective. In Resilience \nTheory and Wicked Problems,87 she takes a close look at the particular \nworld of Rittel and Webber and explains why their approach was \nappropriate for its time but less directly relevant today. Using the \nframework of social-ecological-systems and resilience theory, she \nsituates Rittel and Webber as essentially engineers, realizing that one \ncould not calculate solutions to wicked problems on a slide rule. She \ngroups The List into two baskets\u2014social capriciousness (social goals are \nalways dynamic and contested) and ecological panarchy (systems \ninteract with one another in unpredictable ways, increasing \ncomplexity)\u2014and demonstrates how resilience theory applies to the \nchallenge of climate change. She argues that we now commonly accept \nthe capricious nature of social change\u2014social, cultural, and political \ndiversity is simply a fact of twenty-first century America\u2014and that \ncalling this wicked is no longer a useful insight. Instead, she uses the \nidea of \u201ctrickster law\u201d to argue that we should focus on the potential of \nresilience theory to guide our governance efforts in taming the \nwickedness of ecological panarchy.  \nIn Wicked Problems, Foolish Decisions,88 Scott Campbell and \nMoira Zellner focus on the field that spawned the original wicked \n \n 86.

Wicked Problem Challenges \nIn the Symposium\u2019s keynote presentation and article, The Super \nWicked Problem of Donald Trump,89 Richard Lazarus revisits his \ninfluential 2009 publication, Super Wicked Problems and Climate \nChange,90 which was the first law review article to examine climate \nchange through the wicked problem framework. His 2009 piece was \nwritten in anticipation of impending climate legislation and proposed a \nseries of \u201cprecommitment strategies\u201d to make the measures more \neffective over the longer term. As we now know, of course, no legislation \nwas passed. Lazarus explains how the legislation was thwarted and \nhow executive authority took the place of congressional action. From \ntoday\u2019s vantage, he argues that climate change still warrants its wicked \nmoniker, made super wicked by the temporal factor that the problem \ngets worse the longer we delay. Turning to the Trump Administration, \nhe details efforts to roll back Obama-era climate policies and explains \nhow Trump has exploited the super wicked nature of climate change to \njustify these actions\u2014focusing on short-term economic concerns over \ndistant harms. At the same time, these rollback options have faced \nsignificant obstacles through procedural and substantive \nadministrative law requirements. Indeed, the Obama-era policies have \nexhibited more precommitment stickiness than expected.  \nIn De- and Re-Constructing Public Governance for Biodiversity \nConservation,91 Alejandro Camacho assesses the usefulness of the \nwicked problem framework to loss of biodiversity. He argues that while \nbiodiversity loss clearly qualifies as wicked, this description offers little \n \n 89. Richard Lazarus, The Super Wicked Problem of Donald Trump, 73 VAND. L.

The \ncurrent approach of permit-by-permit regulation is not working, and \nhas proven even more inadequate in the face of climate change. The \ngovernance system has fragmented into overlapping, independent, and \ndecentralized institutions. While some wicked problem analysts \npromote decentralized solutions, this can increase the threat of \ncumulative harms from habitat fragmentation and invasive species. A \nbetter approach, he argues, should focus on multispecies, ecosystem-\nbased, and landscape-level planning. Based on his writings with Robert \nGlicksman,92 he calls for a move beyond the focus on procedural \nmechanisms, instead attending more closely to substantive and \nstructural legal adaptive capacity, coupled with greater attention to \necological health and interventionist strategies.  \nGary Marchant considers the challenge of Governance of \nEmerging Technologies as a Wicked Problem.93 Time and again, \ntraditional government regulation has proven inadequate to manage \nthe risks of emerging technologies, whether synthetic biology, artificial \nintelligence, or nanotechnology. These technologies are particularly \nwicked because they pose what he calls a \u201cpacing problem\u201d (where \ntechnology development and commercialization far outpace the speed of \ngovernment, whether through legislation, regulation, or judicial \nreview), a jurisdictional problem (where the risks of emerging \ntechnologies do not neatly fit within the scope of any single agency), and \nthe basic uncertainty of novelty. Instead, Marchant employs the wicked \nproblem framework to highlight that no single solution exists and that, \nas a result, the ambition for governance strategies should be to \nacknowledge explicitly and promote a mix of substandard governance \napproaches. He develops a 2x2 matrix of policies, ex ante versus ex post \nand permissive versus prohibitive, to contrast the range of governance \nstrategies that have been applied to emerging technologies. Each of \nthese strategies is clearly inadequate as the sole governance \nmechanism, but Marchant proposes instead a combination of strategies \namong multiple actors with the goals of muddling through and \nimplementing imperfect solutions. \n \n 92.

They argue that the wicked problem \nframing creates more heat than light, with no positive guidance for how \nto solve wicked problems\u2014\u201can inescapable Slough of Despond in which \nplanners are doomed to failure no matter what they do.\u201d Indeed, they \ncharge that wicked problems can serve a rhetorical purpose for interests \nseeking to block progress by encouraging a policy paralysis. They see \nclimate deniers using just this tactic to drive delay. This is especially \nconcerning because the temporal aspects of wicked problems transform \nthem into super wicked problems, where inaction has its own costs. As \na way out, they promote Lindblom\u2019s approach of \u201cmuddling through\u201d\u2014\nincremental management of wicked problems that allows midcourse \nadjustments by learning through trial and error. This strategy accepts \nthere is no single best policy and a \u201csilver buckshot\u201d approach makes \nmore sense than holding out for a silver bullet. The governance strategy \nbest suited is one of incremental measures from polycentric governance. \nThis strategy is reinforced in Christopher Serkin\u2019s examination \nof The Wicked Problem of Zoning.95 Laying out the challenge of \nseventeen competing goals of zoning\u2014from economic efficiency and \ndistributional concerns to environmental protection, morality, and \nprivate rights\u2014Serkin argues there can be no single answer to the \nproblems created by contested land use. He describes the criticism over \nmuch of zoning policy as one of compromise and whittling away. Serkin, \nhowever, refutes this criticism as well as The List\u2019s contention that a \nsolution must be a \u201cone-shot operation.\u201d Because there is no holistic \nanswer possible to zoning challenges, he champions incrementalism as \nan ideally paced approach that balances competing interests while \nrespecting expectations and the resistance to fast change. \nCONCLUSION \nIn the fifty years since the wicked problems concept first entered \npolicy sciences theory and practice, it and The List have demonstrated \nremarkable staying power. Policy scholars have used them, revised \nthem, extended them, and rejected them, and yet \u201cwicked problems\u201d \nremain firmly in the policy sciences lexicon and The List is repeated \n \n 94.

The articles from the Vanderbilt Law \nReview Symposium suggest two reasons.   \nFirst, it is fair to say that Rittel and Webber put the nail in the \ncoffin of rationalist, science-based policy theory. Offering nothing in its \nplace, however, their article has served as an invitation for others to do \nso and has become a reference starting point. The first group of \nSymposium articles summarized above is representative. Complexity \nscience, resilience theory, new governance, causal loops, and panarchy \ntheory offer new ways of thinking about governance in the \u201copen \nsystems\u201d context Rittel and Webber identified as the root of the social \nchallenges the nation faced in the 1970s. These new theories face a \nsimilar challenge, though. Even if there are no single solutions to \nwicked problems, it is still unclear how best to manage them. Real-life \napplications of these theories remain few and far between. Wicked \nproblems are not going away, so we need to focus on how we would \ndetermine which of the new governance theories warrant \nimplementation, or even can be implemented. The theory-to-practice \ngap remains large. \nSimilarly, as the second group of Symposium articles \ndemonstrates, the wicked problems framing offers a way of unpacking \nand evaluating the practical challenges of policy design and \nimplementation for problems like climate change, biodiversity loss, \ntechnology, and land use. Whether one is \u201call in\u201d with using the wicked \nproblems frame to guide policy implementation or considers it a \ndistraction or worse, it remains a useful reference point. Explaining \nwhat is means to \u201cmuddle through,\u201d for example, is made easier by \nusing the wicked problems framing, albeit rejecting the implications \nRittel and Webber spelled out. Again, wicked problems are not going \naway; how to manage them remains open for debate.   \nIn short, Rittel and Webber have enjoyed thousands of citations \nto their article, and are likely to receive thousands more, because the \nwicked problems concept and its attributes unpacked in The List \ncapture the essence of the policy challenges of modern society. The \nwicked problem framing has served as a powerful platform for \narticulating new theories of governance and for describing and \nevaluating policy design and implementation in practice.  \nPerhaps the \u201cwicked problem\u201d label and The List are overused \nin this sense\u2014referenced by scholars to position their theory or policy \nsubject as having gravitas, but not fully explored. None of the articles \nin this Symposium could be accused of that lack of rigor. Rather, all of \nthem demonstrate the value of engaging the wicked problems concept \nand The List more deeply, whether to leverage them or to argue their \nlimits and flaws. This issue provides the most comprehensive legal \n        \n2020] GOVERNING WICKED PROBLEMS 1583 \nanalysis of wicked problems to date. We hope that it spurs further \nresearch both on the theory of how to manage wicked problems and on \npractical tools to tame these most important and difficult challenges. \nWe have no doubt that five decades from this Symposium scholars will \nstill be wresting with the best ways to govern wicked problems.  \n \n",

Page  A key component of global ethics, defined as the systematic study of moral principles and theories that apply to the global realm, concerns the equitable distribution of benefits and burdens across time and space. Until recently, the philosophical literature on global distribution was dominated by the question of how benefits and burdens should be divided amongst contemporaries. Recent years, however, have seen a tremendous increase in research on the scope and content of our obligations to future generations. This has led to a number of innovative attempts to extend principles of distribution beyond the confines of the present generation while retaining a focus on the claims of the existing poor. In this article, I examine a key aspect of intergenerational justice, namely, the appropriate \u2018pattern\u2019 of benefits and burdens that should obtain across generations. With the aid of research into the impacts of global climate change, I compare the merits of rival accounts of the pattern of justice and go on to defend a \u2018sufficientarian\u2019 approach to intergenerational justice, which holds that as many persons as possible should enjoy enough well-being to lead a decent life regardless of when they live. Keywords: Distributive justice; obligations to future generations; egalitarianism; global climate change  Introduction Although the origins of intergenerational justice as a major debate in contemporary ethical theory are multi-faceted, a critical factor has been our increasing awareness and understanding of major environmental threats. Issues such as depletion of the ozone layer, the impact of genetically modified organisms, and, in particular, global climate change, have raised the profile of previously marginal questions such as: do we have duties of justice to protect the environment for future generations? If so, what sorts of duties and how strong are they? Can these obligations ever conflict, and overrule, the duties of justice we have to our contemporaries? Do future generations possess claims of justice against members of earlier generations that specify how income and wealth should be distributed across time and space?  It seems that any comprehensive approach to questions such as the above must address three interlinked, but distinct, ethical problems. The first problem is how to establish the scope of justice. This is the question of which entities (individuals, groups, countries, generations) possess distributive entitlements, as well as the question of which entities bear the duties to guarantee these entitlements are respected. Of particular concern, here, is the issue of whether compatriots living at the same time, contemporaries of all nationalities, or all persons living at all times have distributive claims against others. The second problem concerns the appropriate \u2018currency\u2019 of well-being - such as resources, welfare, or functionings - that a theory of distribution adopts in order to concretise the level of entitlement possessed by those identified as subjects of justice (Cohen, 1989; Dworkin, 2000,  pp. 11ff; Nussbaum, 2006, pp. 69ff).  2The third problem, which is the focus of this article, concerns the \u2018pattern of distributive justice (Hurley, 2003, pp.147ff). The issue here is the selection of an appropriate distributive aim that specifies how much of a given currency of well-being the subjects of justice are entitled to receive. Thus, it has been suggested that we allocate benefits and burdens so that some currency of well-being is maximised, or shared equally, or so that the worst off group is as well-off as possible, or so that as many people lead a decent life.1  The issues of who (scope) should get how much (pattern) of what conception of well-being (currency) are of great importance for our understanding of justice both within and between generations. This is because any comprehensive account of our duties to others, wherever and whenever they live, must give a convincing answer to all three questions to avoid the charge that it is incomplete. In this article, I aim to contribute to the development of intergenerational justice by exploring alternative accounts of the appropriate pattern of intergenerational benefits and burdens. With the aid of examples drawn from research into global climate change, I argue, first, that environmental threats (as well as policies designed to respond to them) are of great significance to discussions of the achievement of all of the familiar approaches to the pattern of justice. Second, I suggest how each of these approaches might be applied to issues of intergenerational distribution. Third, I explore the particular merits of the \u2018sufficientarian\u2019 approach to intergenerational justice, according to which benefits and burdens should be distributed so that as many persons as possible enjoy decent lives regardless of when they live. It is important to note that, in order to focus as much as possible on alternative theories of the pattern (rather than the scope) of justice, the discussion proceeds from the universalist assumption that future persons, at least in principle, possess valid claims on social goods. I also assume that it is meaningful to investigate the intergenerational application of theories of the pattern of justice in relative isolation of the question of the currency of justice. In this vein, I refer throughout to a general notion of \u2018well-being\u2019 when it is necessary to refer to the unit in terms of which distributive entitlements should be determined. Finally, I focus in the following on undeserved disadvantages, such as inequalities or absolute disadvantages that are beyond the control of those they affect, and put to one side the problem of deserved disadvantages, such as those that result from an agent\u2019s autonomous choices.  Justice As Equality Perhaps the simplest theory of the pattern of justice is that benefits and burdens should be distributed across some population so that inequality is minimised. We might call this view \u2018intrinsic egalitarianism\u2019 because it holds that inequality is bad or unjust (I use these terms interchangeably) in itself and not because of its consequences. As Temkin has put it, the essence of intrinsic equality is that \u2018it is bad for some to be worse off than others through no fault of their own\u2019 (Temkin, 2003, p.62).   It is worth contrasting intrinsic equality with some closely associated views. Utilitarians, for example, hold that acts and social policies should be evaluated  3only in terms of their consequences, and that these consequences in turn ought to be maximally beneficial in the sense that they promote the maximum amount of welfare possible (Sen and Williams, 1982, pp.3ff). Depending on the circumstances, the utilitarian may prefer an equal distribution of well-being because this coincides with the desire to maximise welfare. The reason for this is that it is generally easier to help the worse off than others - one only has to give them a little for their welfare level to improve a lot. In this sense, utilitarians are \u2018accidental\u2019, rather than intrinsic, egalitarians.  There are other \u2018accidental egalitarian\u2019 theories of distribution that are more persuasive than utilitarinaism. Some of these are motivated by the somewhat paradoxical feature of intrinsic egalitarianism that it aims to reduce, or avoid, inequalities even when this does not benefit the worst off or most needy. The distinction between reducing inequality and giving priority to the worst off, for example, has been explored Derek Parfit in terms of a further clarification of intrinsic egalitarianism. In his influential 1995 Lindley Lecture, entitled \u2018Equality or Priority?\u2019, Parfit argued that intrinsic egalitarianism can be divided into two groups: those that assume that inequality is always in itself bad (\u2018telic egalitarians\u2019) and those that assume that inequality is bad only if it has certain origins (\u2018deontic egalitarians\u2019) (Parfit, 1995, pp.3ff). There are a number of differences between these two views. One is that they diverge on the issue of the amount of inequality and the badness of the inequality of a distributive outcome. Thus, the telic view assumes that the more inequality that exists the worse the outcome. On the deontic view, however, one can have more inequality, but this might not mean we have a worse outcome. It all depends on how this inequality came about.  Parfit went on to show that endorsing either version of intrinsic egalitarianism has important consequences. One of these concerned the way in which applying egalitarianism could have counter-intuitive implications in certain circumstances. Consider a version of what has become known as the \u2018levelling down problem\u2019 (Parfit, 1995, pp.17ff). Here, half of some population are rich and enjoy a high level of well-being, while the other half is impoverished and enjoy a much lower level of well-being. Other things being equal, intrinsic egalitarianism would view a move to an entirely impoverished population in such cases as just in at least one respect, a view that many have regarded as absurd (Raz, 1986, pp. 230-5; Nagel, 1979, pp. 106-122). The Levelling Down Problem suggests that we must either reject the view that it is just in one respect to bring some down to the level of others even if no one benefits, or reject the view that inequality is in itself unjust.  While the levelling down problem seems to apply to all formulations of the telic view, it does not seem to plague the obvious interpretations of the deontic view. The latter condemns outcomes only if they arise from actions that involved wrongdoing. The well-off in the above example might, for example, be viewed as entirely innocent of the misfortune of their less well-off compatriots, so the inequality between these groups may not be regrettable from the deontic egalitarian point of view. Nevertheless, in theory, the deontic view will require that we level down for the sake of no one if it was the product of wrongdoing. This is an important observation, for some egalitarians have argued that much of  4the global inequality that exists today, and which will persist into the future, has origins in the past and present wrongdoing of individuals and institutions in rich populations (Pogge, 2005, pp. 92ff). Although highly controversial, this claim, if defensible, would reduce significantly the number of occasions where the deontic view would have alternative implications to the telic view. That is, where it is possible to redistribute the resources to restore equality, it would be just to level down for the benefit of no one.        The levelling down problem can be reformulated to cover dealings between different generations. Suppose that, following the work of economic growth enthusiasts such as Wilfrid Beckerman and Bj\u00f8rn Lomborg, almost all persons living in future generations will be better off than their predecessors, despite the environmental and social problems the former are set to inherit (Lomborg, 2001, pp. 327-52; Beckerman and Pasek, 2001, pp. 50ff). According to the telic view, it would be better in one respect if the present generation consume a certain amount of resources so that our descendants will not be any better off than us. That is, present persons would be some moral pressure to develop unsustainably since sustainable development, on all of its formulations, involves the creation of intergenerational inequality. According to the deontic view, this pressure is removed since it does not seem plausible to argue that the intergenerational inequality brought about by the sacrifices of earlier generations to save for the benefit of their successors involves wrongdoing. Because it rests on our intuitions about the relative inequality of unequal and equal outcomes, and the examples discussed here are rather abstract, it is not obvious how intrinsic egalitarians should respond to the levelling down problem. Some, such as Larry Temkin, have argued that the problem is illusory. Temkin holds that the levelling down problem merely shows us a consequence of egalitarianism, not a reason to reject it. Given that we believe in a number of ideals, Temkin\u2019s thought is that levelled down outcomes are always desirable \u2018in one respect\u2019 even though they may be undesirable \u2018all things considered\u2019 (Temkin, 2003, pp.68ff). Temkin\u2019s uncompromising defence of telic egalitarianism raises a number of interesting questions about the nature of distributive justice, as well as the appropriate methodology adopted to analyse it. To some, Temkin is merely attempting to defend the indefensible (Crisp, 2003, pp. 758ff). The problem is that there is no obvious methodological procedure to separate an \u2018absurd\u2019 view from a view that is cogent but has yet to develop strong intuitive support.  Recall that a different response to rescue intrinsic egalitarianism from the levelling down problem is to appeal to deontic egalitarianism. The problem with this appeal, which adds force to Parfit\u2019s critique of intrinsic egalitarianism as a whole, is that it cannot explain what is unjust about inequalities between individuals or groups that do not engage, or have not in the past engaged, in dealings of moral reciprocity. Suppose two populations A and B exist, but have little or no mutual dealings. One day a member of the A population decides to visit population B out of curiosity, and finds to their surprise that the people in B are very badly off compared with those in A, although well-being in both populations is evenly distributed. On the telic view, the inequality evident  5between A and B is regrettable (and all things being equal, should be removed as a matter of justice) even if it was not brought about by wrongdoing. It makes no difference, here, that the inequality arose between those that have hitherto had no mutual dealings. The deontic egalitarian, on the other hand, will regard such inequalities as trivial from the point of view of justice since the inequality did not arise from wrongdoing. Let us call this the \u2018blameless inequality\u2019 problem. Granted that the deontic egalitarian might recognise other non justice-based reasons to remove the inequality between A and B, such as compassion or charity, this approach does not seem to be a plausible rendering of either egalitarianism, or distributive justice in more general terms. The dubious global implications of deontic egalitarianism can be shown by reflecting on the following simple thought experiment.2 Suppose it transpired, as the first wave of climate sceptics maintained, that global climate change is a very real phenomenon, but has entirely natural, rather than anthropogenic, origins (Singer, 2000, pp. 1-78).3 Such a revelation would not affect the fundamental message of a host of climate impact analyses, which indicate that climate change will be generally, if not uniformly, adverse for millions of existing and future persons (McMichael and Githeko, 2001, pp. 451-85; Schellnhuber et al, 2006, pp. 133-202). Deontic egalitarians would have us believe that efforts to mitigate inequalities caused, or exacerbated, by climate change would be beyond the call of justice since they could not be traced to wrongdoing. The telic view, by contrast, would recommend that the inequalities caused by climate change be rectified even if no human culprit can be found.  To conclude this section, it seems that both telic egalitarianism (in condoning levelling down for the benefit of no one) and deontic egalitarianism (in leaving the unlucky victims of blameless inequality to fend for themselves) are flawed understandings of the pattern of justice. Justice As Priority One way in which those broadly sympathetic to egalitarianism might avoid the levelling down, and blameless inequality, problems would be to embrace the ideal of priority, according to which the worse off people are the more it matters from the point of view of justice that they be benefited. Parfit calls this the \u2018Priority View\u2019, and those holding it \u2018prioritarians\u2019 (Parfit, 1995, pp. 19ff.). Prioritarians reject the basis of both telic and deontic egalitarianism, namely, that it is bad that some people are worse off than others through no fault of their own. This is because they are unconcerned with the comparative properties of distributive outcomes. Instead, they think it regrettable that people are badly off as such, and the lower the level of a person\u2019s well-being the stronger our duty is to help them. Parfit writes that:   benefits to the worst off matter more, but that is only because these people are at a lower absolute level. It is irrelevant that these people are worse off than others. Benefits to them would matter just as much even if there were no others who were better off (Parfit, 1995, p.23). Similarly, Arneson defines prioritarianism as the view that:   6It is morally more urgent (gains more moral value) to obtain a one-unit well-being gain for a person, the lower the person\u2019s lifetime well-being otherwise would be (Arneson, 2006, p.19). Consider the following example, which concerns choices between competing social policies that alter the distribution of well-being within a hypothetical population. For simplicity, I assume that the policy choices discussed, although they may alter the amount and distribution of well-being, will not alter the population size. The alternative distributions of well-being reflect the possible outcomes of two broad policy \u2018programmes\u2019 that policy-makers can select, each being associated with three specific \u2018environmental policies.\u2019   Distribution 1 (1) all at 5O           (2) half at 40, half at 70           (3) half at 20, half at 80 Distribution 2 (1) half at 49, half at 46       (2) half at 55, half at 45    (3) all at 40   In the case of Distribution 1, the requirements of equality and priority converge. Other things being equal, they guide us to choose policy option (1), either because all are equal with respect to well-being; or that the worst off are better off under (1) than they are under (2) and (3). However, in the case of Distribution 2, the equality and priority views do not converge since inequality exists in outcomes (1) and (2) that does not exist in (3), and the worst off are better off in outcome (1) than they are in (2) or (3). Utilitarianism, by contrast, will favour (2) in both cases since this is the outcome where well-being is maximised. Although the Distribution 1 example is constructed at an abstract level, it tells us that, while they often converge in their distributive recommendations, egalitarianism and prioritarianism and utilitarianism are rival approaches to the pattern of justice.  The distinction between equality and priority is of clear relevance to the construction of theories of intergenerational justice. First, environmental threats such as global climate change pose different sorts of challenge to egalitarianism and prioritarianism when they are applied across time. Second, the aims of equality and priority can diverge at both the practical and the theoretical level in what they require of us in relation to our successors.  Regarding the first issue, it seems that major environmental threats such as climate change are highly relevant for any practical application of the priority view since they will influence the absolute well-being of all in the future. There is a wide consensus amongst climatologists that climate changes, such as sea-level rises and extreme weather events, will influence which regions, and populations, of the world will be worst off in the future and to what extent. One specific example is that increased frequency and severity of coastal flooding will degrade the food and water security of millions in coastal zones and small islands (Nurse and Sem, 2001, pp. 854f; Schellnhuber et al, 2006, pp. 167-85). This will  7exacerbate any existing inequalities between coastal and non-coastal populations, but it will also mean that many more persons will be forced to live in absolute poverty.  Climate change can also be expected to help determine which generations will be most disadvantaged in the future. One problem here concerns \u2018low probability, high impact\u2019 events. These are global climate events caused by the emergence of climate processes that have already been witnessed since the evolution of the species. One example concerns the cessation, or re-positioning, of the thermohaline circulation process that transports heat throughout the globe through movements of surface and deep-sea water. Such an event would have massive social, economic and health impacts on populations residing in Europe and North America, potentially triggering global crisis (Schellnhuber et al, 2006, pp. 37-63). While there are huge problems in quantifying the probability of such events occurring, the threat they pose to human well-being in terms of uncertainty and risk alone warrant their being factored into debates concerning distributive justice.  Turning to the second issue, suppose that the populations experiencing different levels of well-being each belonged to a different time-period where the lives of their members do not overlap. Suppose, next, that the differential prospects of the populations in the Distribution 2 example arise as a consequence of the different environmental policy choices adopted by previous generations (the population halves representing the earlier and the later generation respectively). For simplicity, we might say that policy (1) equates to a moderate conservation stance, policy (2) to no conservation at all, and policy (3) to a radical conservationist stance, which could sustain the same well-being levels indefinitely but at a lower level than either of the other less sustainable policies:    GENERATION 1 GENERATION 2 POLICY 1 49 46 POLICY 2 55 45 POLICY 3 40 40  In this simple, two-generation model, intergenerational egalitarians would have at least some reason to prefer (3). That is, they would have an egalitarian objection to the other two divisions that does not arise with this distribution. Utilitarians, on the other hand, would favour (2) since it maximises total well-being across both generations. Finally, prioritarians would favour (1) as the worst off population is better off under this policy than the alternatives. The picture would change as we include further populations from different time-periods, but this example supports the conclusion that which pattern of justice we prefer will shape our approach to both intergenerational and intergenerational distribution.    8IV JUSTICE AS SUFFICIENCY? To sum up the discussion so far, prioritarianism is a demanding approach to distributive justice that welcomes inequality if it is of benefit to the worst off.  It is not subject to the \u2018levelling down\u2019 or \u2018blameless inequality\u2019 problems since it is a non-comparative view that ignores the origins of the pattern of any given distribution. Finally, it recommends alternative distributions of well-being across generations to its egalitarian rival in at least some circumstances.   In contrast to egalitarians and prioritarians, some theorists, such as Harry Frankfurt, hold that benefits and burdens should be distributed in line with the \u2018doctrine of sufficiency.\u2019 This states that as many people as possible should have enough (of the currency of justice adopted) to pursue the aims and aspirations they care about over a whole life; and that this aim has lexical priority over other ideals of justice, such as equality, priority, or utility (Frankfurt, 1987, pp. 21-43; Frankfurt, 1997, pp. 3-14).  Attaining what we really care about, for Frankfurt, requires a certain level of well-being, but once this level is reached there is no further relationship between how well-off a person is and whether they discover and fulfil what it is that they really care about. Frankfurt holds that, above the level of sufficiency, it is neither reasonable to seek a higher standard of living nor expect as a matter of justice any additional allocation of some currency of justice. It is important to add that \u2018having enough\u2019 is not the same as living a \u2018tolerable\u2019 life in the sense that one does not regret one\u2019s existence. Rather it means a person leads a life that contains no substantial dissatisfaction. Sufficientarianism will often converge with the distributive aims of prioritarianism and egalitarianism. All persons should be helped to the threshold of suffiency if possible, and those who can be helped to lead a decent life are often among the worst off in a population. But the aim of reducing inequality, or of improving the position of the worst off, has no intrinsic value for sufficientarians and will be sacrificed if and when they conflict with the doctrine of sufficiency.  According to Frankfurt, the flaw in intrinsic egalitarianism \u2018lies in supposing that it is morally important whether one person has less than another regardless of how much either of them has\u2019 (Frankfurt, 1987, p.34). What matters, Frankfurt argues, \u2018is not that everyone should have the same but that each should have enough. If everyone had enough it would be of no moral consequence whether some had more than others\u2019 (Frankfurt, 1987, p.21, original emphasis). This does not mean, however, that a concern to equalise well-being will always frustrate sufficiency. Recall the case of Distribution 1:   (1) all at 50        (2) half at 40, half at 70        (3) half at 20, half at 80   Suppose that advances in the human and natural sciences furnished us with an account of the level of well-being at which point a person has \u2018enough\u2019, and that  9this turned out to be 50 units of some agreed currency of well-being. Equality, priority, and sufficiency would in such circumstances converge on recommending the same distribution: (1). In such circumstances, Frankfurt observes, \u2018even if equality is not as such morally important, a commitment to an egalitarian social policy may be indispensable to promoting the enjoyment of significant goods besides equality or to avoiding their impairment\u2019 (Frankfurt, 1987, p.22).  The differences between equality, priority and sufficiency becomes clear when reconsider Distribution 2. Recall that the outcomes here were the following:  (1) half at 49, half at 46       (2) half at 55, half at 45      (3) all at 40   Suppose, again, that the sufficiency level for all was 50. Whereas intrinsic egalitarianism seems, other things being equal, to favour outcome (3) and prioritarianism would favour allocation (1), sufficientarianism would favour outcome (2) since this would be the only outcome in which at least some people had enough. For the sufficientarian, the distribution of benefits and burdens to achieve equality or priority in such cases is indefensible. It would be analogous to the tragedy involved in a famine situation of giving food to those who cannot possibly survive at the cost of those that could survive if they received extra rations. In this sense, the ideal of sufficiency is related to the medical concept of \u2018triage\u2019, according to which, when faced with more people requiring care than can be treated, medical resources should be rationed so that the most needy receive attention first. However, because the category of \u2018most needy\u2019 is defined in terms of the overarching aim that as many people as possible should survive a given emergency, triage protocols often lead to the very worst off being denied treatment in disaster situations in favour of those who can be helped to survive. Frankfurt\u2019s view is that all distributive claims arise in some way from an analysis of where people stand relative to the threshold of sufficiency, or as he puts it the \u2018threshold that separates lives that are good from lives that are not good\u2019 (Frankfurt, 1997, p.6). Egalitarianism, by contrast, posits a relationship between the urgency of a person\u2019s claims and their comparative well-being without reference to the level at which they would have enough. Since allocating people enough to lead decent lives exhausts our duties of distribution, sufficientarians argue that egalitarianism recognises duties that do not exist. In fact, in linking ethical obligations to the comparative fortunes of people, egalitarianism encourages envy and thereby contributes \u2018to the moral disorientation and shallowness of our time\u2019 (Frankfurt, 1987, pp. 22-3). In short, by encouraging the better off to pity the worse off, and the worse off to resent the better off, egalitarianism encourages complacency and arrogance in some and a lack of self-esteem and respect in others.  Although Frankfurt focuses his critique of rival distributive views on intrinsic egalitarianism, it can be readily extended to cover prioritarianism. While the priority view is grounded in the badness of absolute rather than comparative disadvantage, it is also inclined to divert resources to the worst off group even if this would mean sacrificing substantial benefits to other, slightly better off,  10persons who could be helped to lead a decent life. Frankfurt argues that, \u2018It is true that people in the lowest strata of society generally live in horrible conditions, but this association of low social position and dreadful quality of life is entirely contingent. There is no necessary connection between being at the bottom of society and being poor in the sense in which poverty is a serious and morally objectionable barrier to life\u2019 (Frankfurt, 1997, p.2). The problem with prioritarianism, then, is not that it fetishises comparative well-being but rather that it fetishises absolute well-being with the result that mandates constant interference in people\u2019s lives to benefit the worst off. By doing so, prioritarianism is inclined to generate the same sorts of envy and pity as its egalitarian rival, and recommend a huge range of redistributions that do not help their recipients to lead decent lives.  Consider the following example. There are two groups in society, where one enjoys a considerably lower level of well-being than the other, where both groups enjoy a far better than sufficient life, and where the inequalities are undeserved. We can call these groups the \u2018very happy\u2019 and the \u2018extremely happy.\u2019 Egalitarians claim that, if we could do something about it, the very happy group should be compensated for their relative well-being deficit. This is because this theory regards undeserved inequality as bad even if everyone is at least very happy; that is, it makes no ethical difference that the inequality is between groups, or persons, who are very well off. Sufficientarians, by contrast, holds that there is no case at all to redistribute in a world of very happy and extremely happy since this will not bring it about that anyone who did not have enough before will have enough after redistribution. Finally, Prioritarians regard the very happy in isolation of their relative happiness as they are only interested in absolute levels of well-being. Nonetheless, the very happy, as the worst off, deserve the attention of prioritarians even if they live so well they want for nothing. If we are able to help them become better off, that is, it would be unjust not to do so. According to sufficientarians, such a claim is absurd. How can there be a duty to help the \u2018worst off\u2019, they ask, when this group lead lives of such a high standard already? V.  CLIMATE CHANGE, POSTERITY, AND THE DOCTRINE OF SUFFICIENCY We have seen that ideals of equality, priority and sufficiency often converge in the pattern of benefits they recommend. However, conflicts between these ideals emerge both in theory, and in practice, since the composition of the worst off group, comparative fortunes, and people\u2019s positions relative to the sufficiency threshold diverge in various hypothetical examples, as well as in real life. So, even if all three ideals are global in the sense that they specify entitlements to all persons living in all times and places, it can be of great relevance which of these ideals we adopt. In this section, I explore in more detail the benefits of a adopting a sufficientarian approach to questions of intergenerational distributive justice.   Consider the impact of climate change on three particularly important dimensions of human well-being: health, water quality and security and economic wealth. All human beings require a certain level of health to pursue whatever it is they really care about, even if there are limits to the level of general health and nutrition that  11is necessary for people to have enough to pursue their life plans. This is reflected in the broad consensus amongst philosophers that physical and mental health is essential to the functioning of all persons, regardless of their life-plans or social context (Nussbaum, 2006, pp. 76-7; Doyal and Gough, 1991, pp. 49ff; Copp, 1998, pp. 123ff). A key finding of the IPCC Third Assessment Report of 2001 was that the cumulative impacts of climate change on future human health will be, on balance, extensive and adverse (McMichael and Githeko, 2001, pp. 451ff). The World Health Organisation similarly reports that climate change will result in many thousands, possibly millions, of people dying who otherwise would not have died, for example through exposure to extreme heat events, droughts, floods, and changes in infectious disease transmission (McMichael et al., 2003, pp. 43-60). It seems clear that the health impacts of climate change will prevent many future people from leading lives of a decent quality, as well as exacerbating inequality and jeopardising the fortunes of the worst off. The same will be true of water security and socio-economic impacts. The sufficiency view has attracted considerable support in environmental circles in the guise of the pre-eminent understanding of sustainable development. According to this, development should meet \u2018the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs\u2019 (World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987, p. 43). Although the source of great debate and controversy, the core idea is that each generation (considered as a mere aggregate of individuals or more distinctively as a collective in its own right) should refrain from activities that leave later generations without enough, but that this does not mean that an injustice is committed if the latter are prevented from enjoying an exactly similar, or improved, level of well-being. As such, the sufficiency version of sustainable development will result in a different set of requirements than alternative constructions based on priority or equality. Examples of rival constructions are that: \u2018each generation is entitled to inherit a planet and cultural resource base at least as good as that of previous generations\u2019 (Arrow et al, 1996, p.15n) or that \u2018welfare per head of the population must never decline\u2019 (Beckerman, 1999, p.72) or that we should \u2018be concerned with preserving - and where possible expanding - the substantive freedoms of people today without compromising the ability of future generations to have similar, or more, freedoms\u2019 (Sen, 2004, p.1). The exact requirements of sufficientarianism will depend on the distributive context, as well as the specification of the threshold of sufficiency itself, which will be framed in terms of the best scientific evidence available and modified by public deliberation about what constitutes \u2018having enough\u2019 and \u2018dangerous climate change.\u2019 We can assume, however, that a sufficientarian approach would involve stringent action to stabilise, and later reduce, concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere (to minimise the number of lives that are forced under the sufficiency threshold by climate changes that are still preventable) and major international investments in terms of measures and technologies of adaptation (to maximise the number of lives lived at or above the threshold in the face of climate impacts that are no longer avoidable).  12Aside from working towards a global (and stringent) climate accord to replace the current Kyoto Protocol when it expires in 2012, there are numerous smaller scale measures of mitigation and adaptation available to the present generation to fulfil the requirements of intergenerational sufficiency. Energy efficiency could be increased to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions in both the industrial and domestic sectors; transport practices could be altered; and more efficient land management practices could be adopted (Markandya and Halsnaes, 2001, pp. 474ff). Meanwhile, water security could be enhanced in developed and developing countries by improving flood defences; human health impacts could be minimized by improved public health infrastructure in communities vulnerable to extreme weather events; and the socio-economic infrastructure of vulnerable populations could be protected by improved planning. In each case, the idea is that earlier generations are bound by a sufficientarian duty to ensure that their successors have access to a climate system that is hospitable for decent human lives. Perhaps the central difficulty with the doctrine of intergenerational sufficiency is that the distributions it recommends are so sensitive to initial distributions of well-being. Consider the following three background scenarios where very many persons currently lie below the point where they have enough (set as 100 units of well-being). In a \u2018radical insufficiency\u2019 situation, we can help all above the threshold, although this would also involve creating large inequalities. In a \u2018triage insufficiency\u2019 situation, we can help some, but not all, to reach the sufficiency threshold although this would involve creating large inequalities and would not help the situation of the worst off. In a \u2018hopeless insufficiency\u2019 situation, we can improve the situation of many people, but not so that any of these people will thereby lead decent lives.   BEFORE REDISTRIBUTION AFTER REDISTRIBITION TRIAGE INSUFFICIENCY ALL AT 75 HALF AT 50, HALF AT 100 RADICAL INSUFFICIENCY HALF AT 75, HALF AT 150 HALF AT 100, HALF AT 200 HOPELESS INSUFFICIENCY ALL AT 50 ALL AT 99  The appeal of the sufficiency in \u2018triage insufficiency\u2019 cases is that its rivals are inclined to condemn interventions that result in half of the population leading a decent life for the sake of ethical goals that seem inconsequential in the circumstances, namely, the minimisation of inequality or the maximisation of the position of the worst off. The attraction of the view in \u2018radical insufficiency\u2019 cases is that, unlike egalitarianism, it can explain what would be unjust about not intervening. The sufficiency view, however, cannot apparently explain why we should intervene in order to improve human well-being in \u2018hopeless insufficiency\u2019 cases despite such interventions being better for many, and worse for no one.   13The sufficientarian has at two clear responses to this problem, one defensive and one offensive. Defensively, it could be objected that it is too much to ask of one theory that it provide an intuitive approach in all possible distributive contexts, merely that it does not require that we bring about distributions which are unjust. People\u2019s intuitions about the appropriate pattern of well-being in particular cases, even when purged of obvious biases and prejudices, seem so diversely motivated that no theory of justice will cohere with them all.  Offensively, it could be claimed that sufficientarianism is a genuinely distinctive approach to distributive justice in \u2018radical insufficiency\u2019 and \u2018triage insufficiency\u2019 situations, and \u2018hopeless insufficiency\u2019 situations are rare enough to be put to one side. As we saw above, a number of studies suggest that the lives of existing and future people could be greatly improved through measures of mitigation and adaptation so that the numbers of existing and future lives below sufficiency is minimised. While estimating the future global distribution of well-being is an incredibly difficult enterprise, the vast majority of analyses of equity and development take the view that the situation that best describes global development in 2006 is one of radical, not hopeless, insufficiency (World Bank, 2001, pp. 6ff; World Bank, 2005, pp. 9ff; United Nations, 2005, pp. 23ff). Meanwhile, a different approach would be to argue that the appropriate goal in \u2018hopeless sufficiency\u2019 cases is to bring as many as possible to the point where they have the best possible chance of reaching the sufficiency threshold in the future, even if we do not know if this will ever be possible (Copp, 2005, pp.42f).  There are two further issues that need to be addressed before sufficientarianism could be declared as a superior account of the pattern of intergenerational justice. First, we must address the potential counter-intuitions with there being no further issues of justice, or injustice, when all have enough. The problem is obscured when the distributive context involves hundreds of millions of people in our own generation that live in dire circumstances. But it is at least possible to imagine all having enough in the future or at the very least that all who are physically and mentally capable of leading a decent life do so. Can it be the case that there can be no distributive injustice in such situations?  Consider this example (where the sufficiency level has been set at 100):  (1) Half at 150, Half at 200 (2) All at 200  It seems that the doctrine of sufficiency will not distinguish between these scenarios, even though (2) would be preferable to (1) in terms of all rival values. That is, (2) would be much more equal, much better for the worst off, and would create more utility. Can a cogent theory of justice view such gains as trivial from the perspective of justice?   Second, a further problem arises relating to the strength of the priority that sufficientarians give to acts and policies that bring at least some additional  14persons to the point at which they have enough. Consider the following case (where the sufficiency level has again been set at 100):  (3) 99% of persons at 10, 1% of persons at 100 (4) All persons at 99   Here, the most obvious version of the sufficiency doctrine, which holds that bringing people up to the sufficiency level has lexical priority over other values would require that we opt for distribution (3) over (4) even though this means forgoing great increases in well-being for the vast majority. The problem is that this seems to assign an implausibly great marginal value to the gain in well-being that takes a person from just below to just above the point where they are content (Arneson, 1995, pp. 498-500; Arneson, 2006, pp. 20ff). But why should we weigh this positive change so heavily?  One way of responding to problems such as the above would be to construct a \u2018pluralist\u2019 approach to distributive justice. Pluralism, in this context, means that we would appeal to contrasting ideals in different contexts (Daniels, 1996, p.208). First, the ideals could apply in different distributive circumstances. For example, we might give lexical priority to sufficiency when at least some can be brought up to the threshold, but appeal to equality or priority when all are above, or all below, the threshold (Crisp, 2003, pp. 758ff).    Second, sufficiency might be allocated non-lexical priority over other values so that gains in these other values can sometimes outweigh lesser gains in sufficiency when the former are suitably large or when gains in the former can be achieved without affecting the sufficiency of anyone. Arneson has usefully labelled this \u2018moderate sufficientaranism\u2019 (Arneson, 2006, p.21). The benefit of moderate sufficientaranism, which I cannot pursue in detail here, is that it can explain why we should opt for (2) over (1) since it offers tremendous gains in both equality and priority with no adverse impact on sufficiency. Similarly, though more controversially, moderate sufficientarians have at least some reason to opt for (4) over (3) since equality, priority and utility are far better served by ignoring the sufficiency of the few over the opportunity of giving major benefits to the many.   Third, we might subsume one ideal under another while retaining the idea that the subsumed ideal has some degree of intrinsic, and not merely instrumental, value. Sufficientarians generally view inequality as regrettable because of its consequences, such as the way in which it inhibits economic growth, undermines political processes, or is a malign influence on cultural and social life. Yet, there is a more subtle way that inequality matters. This is that some people might fail reach the standards of a decent life if they are continually faced with the discomfiture that many others are far better off. Similarly, some people might fall below the threshold of sufficiency if they begin to enjoy their life less as a result of identifying with the resentment of others who are visibly much worse off (Marmor, 2003, pp. 127ff).   15I have not the space to develop these intriguing possibilities here. I would like to note, though, that the attractiveness of pluralism as an approach to distributive justice is that different ideals match our intuitions in different contexts. Constructing a defensible theory, however, requires much more than tinkering with different principles, and their weighting, in order to fit with our intuitions. It must also involve a careful consideration of the principles, and the connections between them, that is independent of intuitions about particular examples of their use. To miss this second step out would be to invite the criticism that the new theory is parochial in the sense that it \u2018merely systematises and renders coherent the particular beliefs of the cultural or ideological group among whose members the practitioner of the method happens to be\u2019 (Buchanan et al, 2002, p.372).   Defending A Strict Sufficientarian Approach To Justice Allocating sufficiency either \u2018moderate\u2019 or \u2018lexical\u2019 priority over other values presupposes a highly controversial ethical notion. This is that there is a discontinuity in the measurement of personal well-being that separates a life that is decent form one that is not; a life that has enough (of some currency of well-being) and one that does not have enough. Yet, what constitutes enough? According to some, the complex issues raised in the last section are of limited relevance for there is no coherent answer to this question. Arneson, for example, writes that:  \u2018A human life can be better or worse for the one who lives it. Well-being varies by degree. But it is not so clear that there is a natural way to identify a good enough level, a threshold such that it is of paramount moral importance to get people to the threshold but a matter of relative indifference what happens to them above the threshold\u2019 (Arneson, 2006, p. 18). In this last section, I respond to Arneson\u2019s scepticism, firstly, arguing the thought that a threshold of well-being where one has enough is conceptually meaningful and, secondly, sketching briefly how we might establish, substantively, how much is enough for a person by appealing to the notion of basic needs.  The threshold of sufficiency, like other thresholds, is philosophically vague. There will be numerous cases where a person lies just below, or just above, the threshold of a decent life. In such circumstances, it becomes unclear how the sufficiency doctrine applies since we will not be able identify a precise point where additional allocations of well-being to a disadvantaged person transform the statement \u2018this person has enough\u2019 from falsity to truth. The sufficiency threshold, then, bears the hallmarks of a \u2018Sorites\u2019 problem (Williamson, 1994, pp. 11ff).  There are several considerations, however, that point in the direction of accepting a sufficiency threshold, even if it is hard to specify in practice. Some of the most interesting of these reflect the behaviour and attitudes of individual persons. In the strictest sense, drawing any \u2018poverty line\u2019 is arbitrary. There is no answer to the question of why it should not have been drawn slightly above or slightly under the value selected. Yet, it is not arbitrary in the practical sense that people, states, and international institutions habitually make assumptions about the necessary  16features of a decent life. The point, then, is we should ask what assumptions we make in everyday life about well-being and build these into our reasoning about justice.4 To put it slightly differently, we focus not on the difficultly of specifying a precise threshold of sufficiency in the face of philosophical vagueness, but rather we ask what practical work a sufficiency threshold can do, for example in the construction of policies to reduce poverty and promote sustainable development.  The above approach might seem a rather ad hoc approach to the grounding of the sufficiency threshold. Yet, it is worth remembering that the attribution of ultimate value to any threshold is problematic for there can be no clear answer to the sceptic who asks why moving a person to within a whisper of any threshold is not trivial form the point of justice, but to move them from this position to just over the threshold is crucial. Take, for example, the very widely used World Bank and United Nations threshold for extreme poverty. This has been set in terms of an income of less than $1.08 per day, measured in terms of 1993 US$. In 2005, the UN estimated that roughly 1.1 billion people lived under this \u2018extreme poverty line\u2019, 46% of which reside in Sub-Saharan Africa and 31% in South Asia (United Nations, 2005, p. 9). The precise location of the threshold of poverty is, of course, as arbitrary as any threshold of sufficiency, despite being set at a much lower level. Yet, such indicators are extremely useful in the formulation of the goals and targets for of development policy, as well as in the course of academic debates. The first of the UN\u2019s Millennium Goals, for example, has the target of reducing by half the proportion of people in the world who have incomes of less than $1.08 a day by 2015 (United Nations, 2005, p. xii). In the sense that they are widely understood, and provide practical assistance for the application of moral principles, they are non arbitrary.   Suppose we accepted that, following the practical method suggested above, it was at least conceptually plausible to posit a boundary between a life that has sufficient well-being and a life that has not. A substantive problem remains in identifying where this boundary should be set, that is, we might still ask: sufficient for what? As mentioned above, Frankfurt views \u2018having enough\u2019 as much more than having access to the wherewithal necessary to make life bearable. It should not, then, be thought of as the minimum level at which a person ceases to experience \u2018extreme poverty\u2019 or exceeds some slightly more generous indicator of well-being (such as the UN\u2019s threshold of  \u2018mere poverty\u2019 of $2.15 or more a day). Instead, the doctrine of sufficiency relies on a threshold of well-being where a person exhibits no substantial discomfort or distress throughout a life of normal lifespan. So long as all persons who are physically and mentally able have the wherewithal to lead such a life, the duties and entitlements of distributive justice are exhausted.  Although I cannot offer too much precision here, as the threshold will surely vary as it is applied across both space and time, I suggest that a useful way of concretisation the threshold would appeal to the notion of \u2018basic needs\u2019 in a much more explicit way than has been done by sufficientarians such as Frankfurt. Here, we say that a person has enough when all of their basic human needs, generously interpreted, have been met and are likely to continue to be met. The central idea is  17that people must fulfil certain basic needs in order for them to avoid significant harm. As Copp argues, \u2018matters of basic need are things anyone would require in some quantity and in some form in order to avoid a blighted or harmed life\u2019 (Copp, 1998, p. 124; Doyal and Gough, 1991, pp. 39ff; Wiggins, 1987, pp. 14ff). While there are several ways in which we might unpack this notion of harm, I would argue that the most attractive connects the absence of harm with the capacity to be an autonomous rational agent capable of performing the tasks expected of fully functioning members of society. On this view, basic needs are conceived of \u2018the things that, at some time in the course of life, are indispensable in some form and quantity to a rational and autonomous life for a human, given the \u2018laws of nature, unalterable and invariable environmental facts, or facts about human constitution\u2019\u2019 (Copp, 1998, p.125). The notion of basic need requires further elaboration. For example, it is useful to distinguish between \u2018basic needs\u2019 (such as physical and mental health) and the satisfiers, or \u2018forms of provision\u2019, of these needs (such as income and wealth). The \u2018satisfiers\u2019 of needs will vary according to a person\u2019s nature, as well as their historical and cultural circumstances. The basic needs themselves, however, are universal and objective. They are universal, in the sense that the persons living at all times and all places have reason to value the life of a fully functioning member of society, which, for example, exhibits the basic social roles of \u2018parent, householder, worker, and citizen\u2019 (Braybrooke, 1987, p. 48). They are objective in the sense that they are required regardless of whether, and to what extent, they are desired.  Put simply, the approach I am canvassing would seek to enable as many existing and future persons as possible to fulfil, so far as is practically possible, their basic needs over a normal lifetime (Copp, 2001, p. 203). This sketch of what might be called \u2018global needs sufficientarianism\u2019 leaves many questions unanswered. First, it has yet to be established what category of responsibility underwrites the entitlements of justice that the approach specifies. Are they guaranteed by rights, for example?  Second, there is a lingering doubt that the level of well-being associated with meeting one\u2019s basic needs is much lower than the level of well-being traditionally associated with the concern of \u2018having enough\u2019 or of \u2018leading a  decent life.\u2019 A great deal more work remains to done to unpack these two ideas, as well as what constitutes a \u2018normal life\u2019, a \u2018normal lifetime\u2019, and \u2018a basic social role.\u2019  Third, there remains the question of how to settle clashes of need both within and between generations. Even in relatively favourable situations, it may not be possible to guarantee the sufficiency of one population without sacrificing the sufficiency of another. When these populations belong to different generations, a peculiarly intractable problem arises of whose sufficiency should take precedence. Whereas some need theorists claim that priority should be given to those who are already in a position to meet their basic needs (Braybrooke, 1987, pp. pp.166ff), others will regard such a temporal bias as morally unacceptable.  Fourth, and finally, there remain unsolved the problems of scope mentioned in the introduction. The literature on ethical needs tends to assume that the bearers of basic needs are individual persons in contrast to the bearers of the duties to fulfil  18them, who are usually viewed as the societies (or states) to which individuals belong. Yet, the peculiar features of intergenerational justice compound the confusion as to the appropriate \u2018level of analysis\u2019 at which duties and responsibilities should operate, just as they do in the context of international justice (Caney, 2005, pp. 754ff). In short, is it individuals, corporations, states, international institutions, or generations as a whole that possess the duties and entitlements of intergenerational distributive justice? Until cogent answers to these questions can be found, the doctrine of sufficiency remains a promising, yet incomplete, approach to global distributive justice.    References Arneson, R.

For such writers, only \u2018historical\u2019 principles, which explain how resources should be distributed in terms of how they came to be owned and how they were later transferred amongst persons, are consistent with distributive justice. See Robert Nozick, 1974, pp. 153ff.  2 I am grateful to Simon Caney for discussion of this example. 3 Although the research on which this view was based has been discredited, the fact remains that there have been numerous natural transformations of the Earth\u2019s climate over its history. Warmer periods (such as the period between 120 and 90 million years ago) have generally been 5oC \u2013 15oC warmer than cooler periods (such as the last ice age) and sea levels during these periods are thought to have been at least 150 higher than they are today.  4 The approach in the text is inspired by the practical approach to the scope of justice proposed by Onora O\u2019Neill in Bounds of Justice (O\u2019Neill, 2000, pp. 192ff).

    "fullText": "N92-10776\nPALEOLAKES AND LACUSTRINE BASINS ON MARS. David H. Scott, James W. Rice, Jr., and\nJames M. Dohm, U.S. Geological Survey, Flagstaff, Arizona 86001\nThe problems of how warm and wet Mars once was and when climate transitions may have occurred\nare not well understood. Mars may have had an early environment similar to Earth's that was conducive to the\nemergence of life. In addition, increasing geologic evidence indicates that water, upon which terrestrial life\ndepends, has been present on Mars throughout its history (1-8). This evidence does not detract from the\npossibility that life may have originated on early Mars, but rather it suggests that life could have developed over\nlonger periods of time in longer lasting, more clement local environments than previously envisioned.\nIndications of past or present life most likely would be found in areas where liquid water existed in sufficient\nquantities to provide for the needs of biological systems. We suggest that such environments may have been\nprovided by paleolakes-located mostly in the northern lowlands and probably ice covered. Such lakes probably\nwould have had diverse origins. Glacial lakes may have occupied ice-eroded hollows or formed in valleys\nobstructed by moraines or ice harriers. Depressions in which larger lakes accumulated probably originated by\nprocesses other than glacial action, such as crustal warping or impact. Unlike the case on Earth, the Martian\nrecord of the origin and evolution of possible life may not have been erased by extensive deformation of the\nsurface. Thus the basins that may have contained the paleolakes are potential sites for future biological,\ngeological, and climatological investigations.\nOur initial work combining geologic information acquired earlier (1,2,8) with a stud), of new\ntopographic maps of Mars (9) has identified at least 15 large basins that exceed 100,000 kin: in area and 1000\nm in depth (Fig. 1). For comparison, in Pleistocene time, Lake Bonneville in Utah had a maximum areal extent\nof about 50,000 km2 (10). Elysium is the only basin on Mars where we have found direct evidence, both\ngeologic and topographic, of former water levels and spillways or other outlets (8). Spillway elevations indicate\nthat Elysium was probably filled to a depth of about 1500 m during a recent period in Martian history. The\nChryse and Aurorae basins are known to have contained substantial volumes of water during the Hesperian\nPeriod (1,3), and eight other basins show evidence of interior drainage.\nMany of the postulated paleolakes shown in Figure 1 may once have been connected by waterways, as\nsuggested by the occurrence of small channels identified in places on Viking images and by topographic data\n(9). For example, if water extended above the -1000-m contour line enclosing the Elysium basin, it may have\ndrained east and northeast into the Amazonis basin as well as westward into the Utopia, Isidis, and Cebrenia\nbasins. In Amazonis, small channels and landforms that appear to have been modified by water flow are visible\non Viking images. Crater densities are very low (1,11), indicating an Amazonian age for the floor deposits of\nthe paleolake that may have existed here.\nIf water extended above the -2000-m contour enclosing the Amaz_nis basin, it may well have drained\nacross a narrow saddle centered near lat 40\u00b0N., long 155 \u00b0 (9) into the Diacria basin (Fig. 1). Small channels\nnear the saddle area, as well as those mapped (1) farther north, lead directly into Diacria. The Diacria basin, in\nturn, may have been connected with both the Chryse and Acidalia basins by a waterway extending around the\nnorth margin of the Alba Patera lava flows, which are now covered by low-lying plains of the Arcadia\nFormation (1,2). The Acidalia basin also probably received runoff from the profuse channels in Deuteronilus\nMensae near lat 45\u00b0N., long 340 \u00b0 (3,4).\nThe waterways noted above that may have connected the Isidis, Utopia, and Cebrenia basins are\nsuggested by topographic contours (9) and by channels observed on Viking images during our studies. The\nlarge impact basins Hellas and Argyre have inflow channels along their margins; they may have been important\nwater reservoirs and may contain extensive areas of sedimentary deposits (1,3). Basins 12-15 (Fig. 1) show no\nevidence of interior drainage and are considered the least likely sites for ancient lakes.\nhttps://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19920001558 2020-03-19T16:26:58+00:00Z\nReferences:(I) Scott, D.H., and Tanaka, K.L., 1986, U.S. Geol.

We can now synthesize and analyze\nlarge data sets containing genomes, tran-\nscriptomes, proteomes, and multivariate\nphenotypes. At the same time, society\u2019s\nneed for the results of biological research\nhas never been greater. Solutions to many\nof the world\u2019s most pressing problems\u2014\nfeeding a global population, coping with\nclimate change, preserving ecosystems and\nbiodiversity, curing and preventing genet-\nically based diseases\u2014will rely heavily on\nbiologists, collaborating across disciplines.\nTheodosius Dobzhansky famously pro-\nclaimed that \u2018\u2018nothing makes sense in\nbiology except in the light of evolution.\u2019\u2019\nThough Dobzhansky\u2019s statement is some-\ntimes dismissed by biologists in other fields\nas self-promotion, recent advances in\nmany areas of biology have shown it to\nbe prophetic. For example, genomics,\nwhich emerged mostly from molecular\nbiology, is now steeped in evolutionary\nbiology. Evolutionary theory helps to\nexplain our origins, our history, and how\nwe function as organisms and interact with\nother life forms, all of which are crucial to\nunderstanding our future (e.g., [1\u20135]).\nEvolutionary approaches have helped\nreconstruct the history of human culture,\nincluding, for example, the history of\nhuman populations and languages [6\u2013\n11]. And the impact of evolutionary\nbiology is extending further and further\ninto biomedical research and nonbiologi-\ncal fields such as engineering, computer\nsciences, and even the criminal justice\nsystem.\nThe pervasive relevance of evolution\ncan be seen in the 2009 report commis-\nsioned by the National Research Council\nof the National Academies, A New Biology\nfor the 21st Century [12], which identified\nfour broad challenges for biology: develop\nbetter crops to feed the world, understand\nand sustain ecosystem function and biodi-\nversity in a changing world, expand\nsustainable alternative energy sources,\nand understand individual health. In each\nof these areas, the report noted, evolution-\nary concepts and analyses have played\u2014\nand will continue to play\u2014an integral\nrole.\nIt\u2019s hard to overstate evolutionary\nbiology\u2019s power to explain the living world\nand our place in it. Many applications of\nevolutionary theory and methods\u2014from\nanimal and plant breeding to vaccine\ndevelopment to management of biological\nreserves and endangered species\u2014affect\nsociety and promote human well-being\n[13,14]. Much human activity, however, is\nchanging Earth\u2019s climate and habitats,\nwith uncertain but potentially severe\nenvironmental stresses on many other\nspecies [15\u201318], and the solutions to the\nmany resulting problems may well require\nunderstanding evolutionary interactions\namong species and their mutual depen-\ndencies.\nOur ability to apply evolutionary con-\ncepts to a wide range of problems has\nnever been greater. Changes in the\navailability of data and an emerging\nscientific culture that embraces rapid,\nopen access to many kinds of data\n(genomic, phenotypic, and environmen-\ntal), along with a computational infrastruc-\nture that can connect these rich sources of\ndata ([19], Figure 1), will transform the\nnature and scale of problems that can be\naddressed by evolutionary biology.\nPeriodically, groups of scientists meet to\nidentify new opportunities in evolutionary\nbiology and associated disciplines (e.g.,\n[12,20\u201323]). Rather than set a specific\nresearch agenda for the future\u2014clearly\nthe charge of individual investigators\u2014the\naim has been to identify new themes and\nresearch directions that are already emerg-\ning in the field and to focus on the\nintersection of fundamental problems with\nEssays articulate a specific perspective on a topic of\nbroad interest to scientists.\nCitation: Losos JB, Arnold SJ, Bejerano G, Brodie ED III, Hibbett D, et al.

In the\nfollowing sections, we briefly highlight\nsome key applications of evolutionary\nbiology, provide examples of emerging\nresearch areas, and identify infrastructure\nand training needs.\nEvolutionary Applications\nEvolutionary Medicine\nThe new field of \u2018\u2018evolutionary medi-\ncine\u2019\u2019 [24\u201326] posits that understanding\nour evolutionary past can inform us of the\ncauses of perplexing common diseases. For\ninstance, diabetes and autoimmune dis-\neases such as asthma may represent\nmismatches between evolutionary adapta-\ntion to the environments in which humans\nevolved and current conditions. In addi-\ntion, some age-related conditions, such as\ncancer, can be understood as the outcome\nof selection for early reproduction, when\nhumans faced dying of disease or preda-\ntion at an early age. This long-term\nselection on the cellular machinery to\noptimize growth and survival through\nearly reproduction may now explain the\nprevalence of cancer late in life, a modern\nmalaise that emerges because of the\nrecent, rapid extension of postreproductive\nlifespan [27]. Aside from providing expla-\nnations for the occurrence of diseases, the\nfield of evolutionary medicine is also\nconcerned with suggesting strategies for\nslowing the evolution of resistance in\npathogen populations [28\u201330]; strategies\nto improve public health and reduce the\nincidence of common diseases [31,32];\nprediction of diseases that may emerge\nfrom recent host-shifts to humans [33];\ndiscovery, design, and enhancement of\ndrugs and vaccines (e.g., [34]); and\nunderstanding the role of the microbiome\nin human health [35].\nFeeding the Human Population\nFeeding the rapidly growing human\npopulation, especially with increasing\nstress on agricultural systems from climate\nchange, continues to be a major challenge.\nThe green revolution, from the 1950s\nonwards, rested on selective plant breed-\ning for larger yields and was underpinned\nby evolutionary theory [36]. Currently,\nthe trend is to rely on biotechnology to\nintroduce either herbicide resistance genes\nor herbivore-directed toxins, such as Bt, to\ncombat crop competitors and herbivores,\nrespectively, and thus promote increasing\nyields [37]. Unfortunately, genetically\nmodified crops are genetically uniform\nand so do not represent a long-term\nsolution against the evolution of either\nherbicide or Bt resistance. In addition,\nthese herbicide resistance or toxin genes\ncan be transferred to other nontarget\nspecies through pollen-mediated hybrid-\nization, rendering them resistant or toxic\nas well [38]. The agriculture of the future\nmust incorporate evolutionary thinking to\nreduce the evolution of resistance and the\nrisk of pathogen outbreaks. Maintaining\ngenetic diversity in crop and animal\nproduction systems considerably reduces\nthese risks [38].\nSustaining Biological Diversity\nEvolutionary approaches have often\nbeen applied to the conservation of species\nand ecosystems [13,39\u201342]. Linking spa-\ntial data on phenotypes, genomes and\nenvironments in a phylogenetic context\nallows us to identify and name Earth\u2019s\ndiverse life forms. This linkage, in turn,\nhelps to provide the basic units needed to\nquantify taxonomic diversity and to pursue\nits conservation. Determining phylogenet-\nic relationships among species allows us to\nidentify their unique adaptations and\nprovides the historical context to under-\nstand how they arose [43\u201345]. Evolution-\nary approaches also can be used to\ndetermine the origins of invasive species\n[46\u201348] and to help design effective\nremediation [49,50]. Collectively, under-\nstanding the distribution of current biodi-\nversity and its evolutionary response to\npast environmental change is fundamental\nto mitigating effects of ongoing habitat loss\nand climate change [51]. Given the rate of\nanthropogenic climate change, evolution-\nary theory and experiments can help\npredict vulnerability (i.e., inability to\nadapt) of species and thus improve con-\nservation strategies [52].\nComputation and Design\nModels of mutation, inheritance, and\nselection have inspired the development of\ncomputational evolutionary algorithms\nthat are used to solve complex problems\nin many fields [53,54]. In particular,\nengineering and design processes have\nincorporated evolutionary computation,\nleading to improvements in design of cars,\nbridges, traffic systems robots, and wind\nturbine energy, among other applications\n[55\u201359].\nEvolution and Justice\nGenealogical relationships bear on\nmany court cases. Is the defendant really\nthe parent of the plaintiff? Does the\nevidence (e.g., blood, semen, or skin cells)\nat the crime scene tend to exonerate or\nimplicate a suspect? Evolutionary meth-\nods, particularly population genetics, are\nnow used frequently in forensics and court\ncases to test the link of crime scene\nevidence to individuals [60], and phyloge-\nnetic analyses have been vetted and\naccepted as valid and appropriate methods\nfor determining facts of history in the\nUnited States criminal court system [61].\nEmerging Research and Future\nChallenges in Evolutionary\nBiology\nDivining the direction of future scien-\ntific research is always fraught with\ndifficulty. Nonetheless, we feel that it is\npossible to identify some general themes\nthat will be important in coming years. We\nalso present some examples of classic\nresearch problems that remain unsolved\nand that might well be the focus of future\nwork, as well as new and important\nquestions for which evolutionary ap-\nproaches may be key.\nNew Theory\nThe flood of data in all areas of\nevolutionary biology poses important the-\noretical challenges: new kinds of theory are\nsometimes required to make sense of new\nkinds of data. We can already point to\ncertain broad areas of evolutionary biolo-\ngy that will likely demand sustained\ntheoretical work. These include the elab-\noration of more formal theories for\nevolutionary developmental biology (e.g.,\nanalysis of gene network evolution and\nmodification); the more complete incorpo-\nration of the roles of epigenetics, behavior,\nand plasticity in models of trait evolution;\nanalysis of units of selection; and attempts\nFigure 1. Evolutionary biology is being\ntransformed by increasing access to\nburgeoning data on variation in ge-\nnomes, organisms, and the environ-\nment. All this can be connected to the Tree\nof Life (phylogeny), from populations to entire\nclades, and is enabled by new protocols and\nnetworks in biodiversity informatics.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pbio.1001466.g001\nPLOS Biology | www.plosbiology.org 2 January 2013 | Volume 11 | Issue 1 | e1001466\nto construct a quantitative and predictive\ntheory that describes the genetic basis of\nadaptation. In other areas, problems will\nlikely be more statistical than theoretical.\nIndeed, the enormous quantity of genome\ndata poses serious statistical challenges\neven for fields that already possess strong\ntheoretical foundations, such as evolution-\nary genetics.\nThe Explosion and Diversity of Data\nDNA sequencing can now generate\nwhole-genome data not only for single\nrepresentatives of a few species but for\nmultiple individuals from multiple conspe-\ncific populations and even from entire\ncommunities. Such multilevel data are\ngiving rise to whole new fields of study\n(e.g., population genomics and metage-\nnomics) as well as to new theoretical,\ncomputational, and data management\nchallenges.\nOne particularly exciting avenue of\nresearch afforded by new genomic tech-\nnology is the possibility of directly observ-\ning the dynamics of evolution. In the last\nfew years, genomic analyses of experimen-\ntal evolution have yielded new under-\nstanding of how RNA molecules, viruses,\nand bacteria evolve (bacteria: [62,63];\nvirus: [64]; RNA molecules: [65]). This\napproach is now being applied to eukary-\notic model systems such as C. elegans and\nyeast [66\u201368]. These efforts will continue\nto expand and will surely involve natural\nsystems in field settings. Past evolution, for\nexample, can be inferred from samples\nderived from ancient specimens, archived\nmaterial in museum collections, lake\nsediments, and glacier cores. Contempo-\nrary evolution can be inferred from\ngenomic sampling across seasons and\nyears and can be detected in response to\nclimatic disturbances such as El Nin\u02dco\nevents and to manmade environmental\nchanges such as oil spills. In parallel with\nlong-term ecological data (e.g., species\nabundance and distributions through\ntime), we can now track genomic variation\nthrough ecological and evolutionary time.\nThis capability, together with the realiza-\ntion that evolutionary change can occur\non ecological timescales [69], provides an\nimportant new window on real-time\nevolution. Evolution on contemporary\ntime scales is likely to be especially\nimportant in the context of evolving\npathogens, pest resistance, and the re-\nsponse of organisms to rapid environmen-\ntal change.\nWhile the explosion of data on genome\nsequences has received the most attention,\nsupplementing these data with information\non the natural history of individuals,\nspecies, and their environments will be\nimportant. Core information from field-\ncollected specimens always includes species\nidentity and place and time of collection,\nbut increasingly, this information is being\nenriched with links to field notes and\nphenotypic (e.g., images), behavioral (e.g.,\nsounds), and genomic data in a variety of\ndatabases (e.g., Morphbank\u2014http://www.\nmorphbank.net/, Barcode of Life\u2014http://\nwww.barcodeoflife.org/, Macaulay Li-\nbrary\u2014http://macaulaylibrary.org/). Pre-\ncise information on place, time, and\nreproductive stage can be integrated with\ndata on local environmental conditions,\noften obtained from remote sensing [70].\nThe key is to connect information across\nrepositories, such as natural history muse-\nums and genomic databases (Figure 2).\nSuch efforts will also include observational\ndata provided by the broader public [71].\nEvolutionary Processes That Shape\nGenomic and Phenotypic Variation\nThe availability of genomic data from a\nremarkable range of species has allowed\nthe alignment and comparison of whole\ngenomes. These comparative approaches\nhave been used to characterize the relative\nimportance of fundamental evolutionary\nprocesses that cause genomic evolution\nand to identify particular regions of the\ngenome that have experienced recent\npositive selection, recurrent adaptive evo-\nlution, or extreme sequence conservation\n[72\u201375]. Yet more recently, resequencing\nof additional individuals or populations is\nalso allowing genome-wide population\ngenetic analyses within species [76\u201382].\nSuch population-level comparisons will\nallow even more powerful study of the\nrelative importance of particular evolution-\nary processes in molecular evolution as well\nas the identification of candidate genomic\nregions that are responsible for key evolu-\ntionary changes (e.g., sticklebacks [83],\nbutterflies [84], Arabidopsis [85]). These\ndata, combined with theoretical advances,\nshould provide insight into long-standing\nquestions such as the prevalence of balanc-\ning selection, the relative frequency of\nstrong versus weak directional selection,\nthe role of hybridization, and the impor-\ntance of genetic drift. A key challenge will\nbe to move beyond documenting the action\nof natural selection on the genome to\nunderstanding the importance of particular\nselective agents. For example, what pro-\nportion of selection on genomes results\nfrom adaptation to the abiotic environ-\nment, coevolution of species, sexual selec-\ntion, or genetic conflict? Finally, as se-\nquencing costs continue to drop and\nanalytical tools improve, these same ap-\nproaches may be applied to organisms that\npresent intriguing evolutionary questions\nbut were not tractable methodologically\njust a few years ago. The nonmodel systems\nof today may well become the model\nsystems of tomorrow [86].\nEarth\u2013Biosphere Interactions Over\nVast Stretches of Time and Space\nWe are in the midst of a massive\nperturbation of natural communities as\nspecies respond to human-driven changes\nin climate and land cover. Beyond the\nchallenge of understanding the capacity of\nspecies to respond (e.g., [51,87]) and the\npotential for dramatic state-shifts in the\nbiosphere [17] lies the daunting problem\nof understanding the many interactions\nbetween community-scale ecological dy-\nnamics and evolution of traits within\npopulations.\nWe now can also ask if evolution\nmatters for ecosystem functioning. To\ndate, most ecosystem studies have assumed\nthat all individuals that compose a popu-\nlation within a community are equivalent\necologically. But individuals within a\npopulation are variable, and this variation\nmay lead to ecological interactions that are\nin a continual state of evolutionary flux as\necologically driven evolutionary change\nfeedbacks to alter the ongoing ecological\ninteractions [88\u201390]. This evolutionary\nperspective on communities is an emerg-\ning area that will require the acquisition\nand analysis of large, temporal samples of\ngenomic and phenotypic data, as well as\nthe direct measurement of fitness. Samples\nthat include paleo/historical DNA as well\nas contemporary DNA might be especially\nvaluable by providing a temporal view on\nsuch questions.\nUnderstanding Biological\nDiversification\nA major and urgent challenge is to\nimprove knowledge of the identity and\ndistribution of species globally. While we\nneed to retain the traditional focus on\nphenotypes, powerful new capabilities to\nobtain and interpret both genomic and\nspatial data can and should revolutionize\nthe science of biodiversity. Building on\nmomentum from single-locus \u2018\u2018barcoding\u2019\u2019\nefforts, new genome-level data can build\nbridges from population biology to system-\natics [91]. By establishing a comprehensive\nand robust \u2018\u2018Tree of Life,\u2019\u2019 we will improve\nunderstanding of both the distribution of\ndiversity and the nature and timing of the\nevolutionary processes that have shaped it.\nStudies of the biodiversity of Bacteria\nand Archaea are complicated by the\nPLOS Biology | www.plosbiology.org 3 January 2013 | Volume 11 | Issue 1 | e1001466\nwidespread occurrence of lateral gene\ntransfer. However, the phylogeny of these\norganisms and their genes remains critical\nto understanding their scope, origins,\ndistributions, and change over time [92].\nThe advent of metagenomic sequencing of\nenvironmental microbial communities has\nrevealed greater diversity and flux of\ngenotypes than ever imagined, defying\nconventional species concepts and present-\ning a major challenge to applying tradi-\ntional evolutionary and ecological theory\nto understanding microbial diversity\n[93,94]. Addressing this challenge will be\nnecessary to advance microbial ecology\nbeyond the descriptive stage. Moreover, it\nis only with such understanding that a\nnatural history of microbes can be devel-\noped, leading to more meaningful explo-\nration of genomic structure and function,\nthe origin of novel genes, and increased\nknowledge of microbial influences at both\nthe global and individual (microbiome)\nlevels.\nIn addition to documenting biodiversity,\nmore research is needed on the processes\nthat produce this diversity. While research\non speciation has seen a resurgence over\nthe last two decades [95\u201397], new tools\u2014\nincluding genomic data\u2014can support new\napproaches for a number of important\nquestions, including discovering genomic\nsignatures underlying the evolution of\nprezygotic reproductive isolation, and\ndescribing how hybridization, contact\nbetween incipient species, genome reorga-\nnization, and genome duplication, affect\nspeciation.\nUnderstanding the diversification of\nspecies and the origin of adaptations poses\na number of challenges for evolutionary\nbiologists, including integration of the\nfossil record with diversification inferred\nfrom the relationships among contempo-\nrary species; determining the relationship\nbetween lineage and phenotypic diversifi-\ncation; understanding the factors that lead\nto the replacement of clades over time;\nunderstanding the occupancy of ecological\nniche space through evolutionary diversi-\nfication, adaptive radiation, and extinc-\ntion; and assessing the role that evolving\nspecies interactions play in diversification.\nAll evolution has an ecological context\nthat is essential to the interpretation of\ndiversification. Consequently, we need to\nincorporate analyses of the environmental\ncontext of evolution, particularly species\ninteractions that are likely to both set limits\nto diversification and promote evolution-\nary novelty. For all these reasons, further\nintegration of paleontology with other\nfields of evolutionary biology, as well as\ndevelopment of genetic-evolutionary re-\nsearch programs on clades with excellent\nfossil records (e.g., foraminifera, diatoms,\nmollusks; Figure 3), will be important.\nMore generally, uniting understanding of\nevolutionary pattern and process will\nrequire reductionist studies on evolution-\nary mechanisms of species formation and\nphenotypic change, as well as broadly\nhistorical studies that incorporate phylo-\ngenetic, paleontological, and geological\ndata.\nAs we address these challenges, the\nimportance of natural history data cannot\nbe overemphasized. Observations on the\nnatural history of organisms, the basic\nbuilding blocks of more detailed studies of\necology and evolution, are critical if we are\nto preserve and understand biological\ndiversity [98]. Though few would argue\nagainst this point in principle, natural\nhistory research is rarely encouraged or\nsupported. Making the acquisition of\nnatural history data an integral part of\nhypothesis-driven science is now more\nimportant than ever.\nFigure 2.

Still others involve how we train\nthe next generation of evolutionary biolo-\ngists, who will need a better grasp of\ndiverse disciplines\u2014from natural history\nto developmental biology\u2014as well as\nbioinformatics skills to handle immense\ndatasets across multiple fields (see Text S1\nand also Figure S2).\nThe infrastructure challenges center on\ncreation of new kinds of databases\u2014for\ninstance, ones that focus on (continuous)\nphenotypic and not merely (discrete) DNA\nsequence data\u2014as well as on integration\nacross databases to allow synthesis of very\ndifferent kinds of data (see Text S2). The\ncultural challenges center on the need for\nsupporting a climate of scientific openness.\nMaintaining openness will require evolu-\ntionary biologists to make the results of\ntheir research available rapidly and in a\nform that is most useful to their colleagues.\nThe scientific community has already\nmade great strides in this direction (for\ninstance by requiring deposition of data as\na condition for publication and by found-\ning open access journals), but additional\nsteps are necessary. We strongly support\nthe movement toward open access for the\nscientific literature to accelerate research\nand allow more investigators to partici-\npate. We also encourage provision of open\nsoftware, data and databases, as well as\ntheir computational reuse and distillation,\nas outlined by Lathrop et al. (2011) [99].\nThese individual and community efforts\nwill be increasingly necessary for develop-\nment of new research programs and\ninsights.\nAs noted at the outset, we live in an\nexciting time for evolutionary biology. The\nfield has embraced the \u2018\u2018omic\u2019\u2019 revolution,\nand answers to many classic questions,\nwhich have motivated research for a\ncentury, are now within reach. The study\nof evolution, which in the past was often\nequated with changes in gene frequencies\nin populations, has become more holistic\nand integrative. Researchers are increas-\ningly interested in exploring how interac-\ntions among genes, individuals, and envi-\nronments have shaped the evolutionary\nprocess, both at micro- and macrolevels.\nAt the same time, large challenges such as\nglobal warming, novel infectious diseases,\nand threats to biodiversity are increasing,\nand the opportunity for evolutionary\nFigure 3. Developing genetic and evolutionary tools for taxa with an extensive fossil record will be an important means of\nintegrating the study of evolutionary pattern and process. Genomic sequence data for stickleback fish is now providing insight into\nevolutionary patterns, such as the reduction in the pelvic skeleton, manifest both in the fossil record and in extant populations [83].

The task of integrating evolution-\nary knowledge within and across scales of\nbiological organization, as discussed\nabove, requires development of many\ncomparative databases and analytical\ntools. We would do well to collaborate\nbroadly, cultivating new expertise, and to\nwatch out for the unexpected, as analyses\nof new kinds of data can reveal that\npreconceptions are unfounded.\nBecause most of our science is support-\ned by limited public funds, evolutionary\nbiologists and ecologists should support\nand participate in efforts to help the public\nunderstand the issues and the value\nof scientific understanding. Science in\ngeneral and evolutionary science in par-\nticular are often politicized, exactly be-\ncause of their fundamental importance to\nhuman society. The next 20 years hold the\npromise of a golden age for evolutionary\nbiology. Whether we realize that promise\ndepends in part on how effectively we\ncommunicate that message.\nSupporting Information\nFigure S1 An example of the enormous\nphylogenetic trees that soon will represent\nthe norm in phylogenetic analyses.

INTRODUCTIONA significant amount of natural resources (lands, waters, biodiversity, ecosystem services etc.) are part of agricultural systems. Modern agriculture significantly affects the state and sustainable exploitation of natural resources being a major factor for environmental degradation (pollution, destruction, extortion) as well an important contributor for conservation and improvement of natural resources. Therefore, the issues associated with the effective governance and strategies for sustainable exploitation and conservation of natural resources in agriculture are among the most topical in public, political, business and academic debates around the globe (Baba et al.; COST; Dobbs and Pretty; Dugos and Dupaz; Defrancesco et al; EC; Farmer; Hagedorn; Hart and Latacz; McCanna et al.; Peerlingsa and Polman; Reed; Scozzari \u0430nd Mansouri; UN).                                                             1 1 Correspondence address: Institute of Agricultural Economics, 125 Tzarigradsko Shose Blvd., Blok 1, 1113, Sofia, Bulgaria, e-mail: hbachev@yahoo.com2Despite its importance, the research on governance mechanisms and strategies fornatural resources conservation in agriculture is at the beginning stage due to the \u201cnewness\u201d of the problem, and the emerging new challenges and risks in recent years (inter-sectors competition for natural resources, global climate change, depletion of non-renewableenvironmental resources etc.), and the fundamental development of economic theory in the last two and a half decades, and the \u201clack\u201d of long-term experiences and relevant data for the process and efficiency etc. Most studies are focused on the specific aspects of natural resource management and strategies (soils, waters, biodiversity, agro-ecosystems services) without studying their relations, complementarities and contradictions. What is more, they are typically restricted to a certain form of governance (eco-product, eco-contract, eco-cooperative, industry eco-initiative, public eco-program), or specific type of farm (family, agri-firm, cooperative), ormanagement level (farm, ecosystem, national), or a particular location (region, ecosystem).Usually they are focused on pure and formal management forms, mechanisms and strategies, while various (and often more efficient) informal and complex forms (integral, interlinked, multilateral, multilevel) are ignored.Besides, uni-sectoral analyses are broadly used which separate the governance of farming from the management of overall households and rural activities. Moreover, \u201cnormative\u201d (to some \u201cideal model\u2019 or \u201cmodel in another country\u201d) rather than a comparativeinstitutional approach between feasible alternatives in the specific socio-economic and natural environment of a certain farm, region, sector, or country is employed. Likewise, thesignificant social costs associated with the governance, known as transaction costs, are not (or only partially) taken into consideration. Furthermore, unidisciplinary approaches dominate, and efforts of researchers in economics, organization, law, sociology, agronomy, ecology, technology, and behavioral and political sciences are rarely united to deal with that complex matter. Lastly, there are fewstudies on specific institutional, economic, ideological, cultural, natural, etc. factorsresponsible for the big variation among countries, regions, industries, and organizations of agricultural activity.Consequently, our understanding on the institutional, behavioral, technological, ecological, international, etc. factors of the management and strategies of natural resources conservation in agriculture is impeded. Neither the spectrum of feasible formal, informal,market, private, public, integral, multilateral, transnational, etc. modes of governance can be properly identified, nor their efficiency (potential and limits), complementarities, conflicts, and prospects of development correctly assessed. All these restrict our capability to assist improvement of public policies, strategies, and modes of intervention, and to support individual, business and collective strategies and actions for effective natural resources conservation.This paper suggests a holistic framework for assessment and improvement of management strategies for conservation of natural resources in agriculture. 3First, it incorporates an interdisciplinary approach and presents a modern framework for assessing environmental management and strategies in agriculture.Second, it presents evolution and assesses the efficiency of diverse management forms and strategies for conservation of natural resources in Bulgarian agriculture during post-communist transformation and European Union (EU) integration, and evaluates the impacts of EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) on environmental sustainability of farms of different juridical type, size, specialization and location. Finally, it suggests recommendations for improvement of public policies, strategies and modes of intervention, and private and collective strategies and actions for effective environmental protection.2. Framework for analyzing natural resources management and strategies in agricultureModes of agro-eco-management and agro-eco-strategiesEnvironmental management means management of environment preservation and improvement activities of individual agents. Maintaining and amelioration of the state of natural environment and its individual components (air, waters, lands, biodiversity, climate, ecosystem services) requires an effective social order (governance) regulating behavior and relations of various agents related to environment - a system of motivation and coordination of (eco)actions which is to induce appropriate behavior 2 of individuals and coordinated actions at group, regional, national, and transnational levels [Bachev, 2010].Environmental management in agriculture (or agro-eco-management) comprises the environmental management associated with agricultural (food, fibber, fuel, raw material etc.) production. It (is to) involves management of activities, relations, and impacts of diverse agrarian (farm managers, resource owners, agricultural labor etc.) and non-agrarian(upstream and down-stream businesses, consumers, residents, interest group etc.) agents (Figure 1).  Individual agrarian agents (farmland owners, farm entrepreneurs, farm labor) may have quite diverse strategies in terms of natural resources conservation (Figure 2). According to their ideologies and environmental ethics, awareness of environmental risks, managerial and technical ability, some individual agents may have direct natural resources conservation goals. Accordingly these green individuals will pursue natural resources conservation strategy in their everyday life and activity. For instance, for natural resource owners the sustainable exploitation (conservation) of their assets is often a primary concern and often it determines the type of farms they set up, other ventures (e.g. group or cooperative farms) they participate, or lease out contracts they sign. Similarly, a pro-environment farm entrepreneur establishes green (individual, cooperative, firm) farming structure following own or collective voluntary                                                             2 \u201cpro-environmental\u201d actions, \u201canti-environmental\u201d inactions.4eco-code of behavior. Finally, farm labor may seek employment in a green cooperative or companies with eco-social responsibility.Figure 1: Structures of environmental management in agriculture1 blank line Arial Narrow 10 ptFigure 2: Natural resources management strategies in agricultureFurthermore, in recent years there have been developed a great number of farms and farming enterprises with a primary or a major mission environmental conservation and improvement. For instance, in many EU countries environmental cooperatives have been very popular there are numerous green agri-firms etc.Businesses Residents                                     Climate    Lands    Waters        AirBiodiversityInterest groupsIndividualCollectiveNationalTransnationalFarm NFarm 1ConsumersOwners of natural resources FarmentrepreneursFarm laborGroup farms Cooperatives Agri-firmsSubsistentcefarmsCONSERVATION OF NATURAL RESOURCESInstitutional normsMarket demands5Nevertheless, most farm structures in modern world have other goals and pursue other (than natural resources conservation) strategies \u2013 e.g. agri-firms are profit-oriented and their primary strategy is to maximize profits for shareholders, cooperatives are member-oriented and carry strategy to increase benefits for members etc. However, there have been increasing consumer demands for environmental conservation, and for related organic eco- and specific products from agriculture. Consequently, many market oriented farms change their behavior in order to meet this growing market demand while keeping traditional (profit-making) strategy.Finally, in modern societies there are a great number of formal and informal norms and restrictions related to exploitation of natural resources. For instance, in EU there is a huge body of environmental legislation and various environmental conservation programs. These institutional rules impose individual agents and farming structures mandatory norms and/or offer incentive to join voluntary schemes aiming at limiting environmental pressure, securing sustainable exploitation of natural resources, preservation of biodiversity, reducing pollution and emission of harmful substances etc. This new public order modifies individual strategies and behavior and eventually leads toward conservation of natural resources.  Thus achieving the effective natural resources conservation in agriculture will always be result of implementing of multiple voluntary or induced by market, community, public policies etc. individuals, farms, businesses, consumers, and public strategies.In certain cases, eco-management in agriculture is entirely archived through individual actions of autonomous agents (farms) within the \u201cSector Agriculture\u201d (yellow pattern area of Figure 1). For instance, a good care and sustainable use of privately owned agricultural landsand water sources are typical in a family farm since they are integral part of the strategy for sustainable development of that family enterprise. Similarly, many group farms have a primary goal for sustainable development or are set up as a green farms. Even when the individual strategies of farm\u2019s components (e.g. a hired labor, a family or a group member) do not coincide with the overall farm strategy, the effective management (internal order) is able to achieve the goals for farm\u2019s sustainable growth.However, the effective environmental management often necessitates concerted (collective) actions and eco-strategies of a number of farms as it is in the case of sustainable use of a common pasture and limited water supply, protection of local biodiversity, effective provision of agro-ecosystem services etc. Furthermore, modern farming activity is often profit-oriented and frequently associated with significant positive and/or negative externalities. Implementation of individual strategies of different farmers not always leads to overall conservation of natural resources. That requires a \u201ccommon\u201d strategy and managing relations (cooperation, reconciling conflicts, recovery of costs) between different farms, and increasingly between farmers and non-farmers. For example, adverse effects of agricultural activities on water and air quality are often felt by residents and businesses in neighborhood or more remote regions. Similarly, agricultural contribution to ecosystem services benefits a large number of residents, visitors, consumers, businesses, and interest groups requiring certain collective actions for sustainable supply. In all these instances, environmental management goes beyond simple (technical, 6agronomic, ecological) \u201crelations with nature\u201d and embraces the governance of relations and collective actions of agents with diverse interests, power positions, awareness, capabilities etc. in large geographical, sectoral, and temporal scales [Bachev 2011a]. What is more, modern environmental management is associated with growing needs for \u201cadditional\u201d actions (monitoring, coordination, investments etc.) and integral management of natural resources and eco-risks at national and progressively at transnational scale. The later include water and garbage management, biodiversity conservation, climate change etc. issues demanding effective regional, nationwide, international, and global governance. For instance, the effective management of biodiversity \u201ccomponent\u201d of environment includes multilevel (individual, sectoral, national, EU, worldwide) and multilateral initiatives of numerous farmers, businesses, consumers, residents, interests groups etc. (area under green downward arrows, Figure 1). The same is true for waters, lands, air, ecosystem services etc. management.Thus effective conservation of natural resources will be achieved by coordinated collective actions and implementation of multisectoral and multilevel strategies of individual, family, partnership, private juridical, public juridical, state etc. agents with diverse immediate goals, positions, capability and interests.Individuals behavior (actions, restriction of actions) are affected and governed by a number of distinct modes and mechanisms of management which include (Figure 3):Figure 3: Modes of environmental management in agriculture Figure 2. Modes of environmental management in agriculture First, institutional environment (\u201crules of the game\u201d) - that is the distribution of rights between individuals, groups, and generations, and the system(s) of enforcement of these rights and rules [Furuboth and Richter; North]. The spectrum of rights could embrace material assets, natural resources, intangibles, certain activities, clean environment, food security, intra- and inter-generational justice etc. A part of the rights and rules are constituted by formal laws, regulations, standards, court decisions etc. In addition, there are important informal rules and rights determined by tradition, culture, religion, ideology, ethical and moral norms. Enforcement of rights and rules is done by the state, community pressure, trust, reputation, private modes, and self-enforcement.STATE AND RISKS OF NATURAL ENVIRONMENT   I n s t I t u t I  o n a l      e n v I   r o n m e n tNatural agrarian resourcesFarm 1 Farm NPrivate modesPublic modesMarket modesHybridsConsumersBusinesses ResidentsInterest groupso n a l  i7Institutions and institutional modernization create dissimilar incentives, restrictions and costs for maintaining and improving environment, intensifying eco-exchange and cooperation, increasing eco-productivity, inducing private and collective eco-initiatives, developing new eco- and related rights, decreasing eco-divergence between social groups and regions, responding to ecological and other challenges etc.  The institutional \u201cdevelopment\u201d is initiated by the public (state, community) authority, international actions (agreements, assistance, pressure), and the private and collective actions of individuals. It is associated with the modernization and/or redistribution of the existing rights; and the evolution of new rights and the emergence of novel (private, public, hybrid) institutions for their enforcement. In modern society a great deal of individuals\u2019 activities and relations are regulated and sanctioned by some (general, specific) formal and informal institutions. However, there is no perfect system of preset outside rules that can manage effectively the entire eco-activity of individuals in all possible (and quite specific) circumstances of their life and relations associated with the natural environment.Second, market modes (\u201cinvisible hand of market\u201d) \u2013 those are various decentralized initiatives governed by free market price movements and the market competition \u2013 e.g. spotlight exchanges, classical contracts, production and trade of organic products and origins etc.The importance of free market for the coordination (direction, correction) and stimulation of economic activities, exchanges and allocation of resources is among fundamentals of the Economic theory. Individual agents use (adapt to) markets profiting from the specialization and mutually beneficial exchange (trade) while their voluntary decentralized actions govern the overall distribution of efforts and resources between activities, sectors, regions, eco-systems, countries etc. Nevertheless, there are many instances of lack of individual incentives, choices and/or unwanted exchanges related to conservation of natural environment - e.g. missing markets, monopoly and power relations, positive or negative externalities etc. Consequently, free market \u201cfails\u201d to manage effectively the entire eco-activity, exchanges, and investments of individuals.Third, private modes (\u201cprivate or collective order\u201d) \u2013 those are diverse private initiatives and special contractual and organizational arrangements \u2013 e.g. voluntary eco-actions, codes of eco-behavior, eco-contracts, eco-cooperatives etc.Individual agents take advantage of economic, market, institutional etc. opportunities and deal with institutional and market deficiency by selecting or designing mutually beneficial private modes (rules) for governing their behavior, relations and exchanges. The private mode negotiates own rules or accepts (imposes) existing private or collective order, transfers existing rights or gives new rights to counterpart(s), and safeguards absolute  and/or contracted rights. In modern society a great part of the agrarian activity is managed by voluntary initiatives, private negotiations, \u201cvisible hand of the manager\u201d, or collective decision-making. Nevertheless, there are many examples of private sector deficiency in governing of socially desirable activity such as environmental preservation, eco-system services etc.8Forth, public modes (\u201cpublic order\u201d) \u2013 these are various forms of public (community, government, international) intervention in market and private sectors - e.g. public guidance, public regulation, public taxation, public assistance, public funding, public provision, property right modernization etc.The role of public (local, national, and transnational) governance has been increasing along with the intensification of activity and exchange, and growing interdependence of socio-economic and environmental activities. In many cases, effective management of individual behavior and/or organization of certain activity through a market mechanism and/or a private negotiation would take a long period of time, be very costly, could not reach a socially desirable scale, or be impossible at all. Thus a centralized public intervention could achieve the willing state faster, cheaper or more efficiently. Nonetheless, there are a great number of bad public involvements (inaction, wrong intervention, over-regulation) leading to significant problems of sustainable development around the globe [Bachev, 2010].Fifth, hybrid forms \u2013 some combination of the above three modes.The efficiency of individual management modes is quite different since they have unlike potential to: provide adequate eco-information, induce eco-friendly behavior, reconcile eco-conflicts and coordinate eco-actions of different parties, impact environmental sustainability and mitigate eco-risks, and minimize the overall environment management (conservation, third-party, transaction) costs, for agents with different preferences and capability, and in the specific (socio-economic, natural) conditions of each eco-system, community, industry, region, and country. For instance, appropriate eco-information would be enough to induce voluntary actions by a \u201cgreen\u201d farmer, while most commercial enterprises would need outside incentives (price premium, cash compensation, punishment); market prices would usually coordinate well relations between water suppliers and users, while regulation of relations of water polluters and users would require a special private or public order; independent strategies and actions of farms would improve the state of local eco-systems, while dealing with most of (regional, national, global) eco-challenges requires collective actions in large geographical and temporal scales, etc.\u201cGovernance matters\u201d and depending on the (efficiency of) system of management \u201cput in place\u201d the individual communities and societies achieve quite dissimilar results in eco-conservation and improvement. Consequently, the extend of conservation of natural resources in agriculture (type of exploitation of natural resources by agriculture and the agricultural impact on environment) would differ quite substantially in different stages of developmentand among diverse farming structures, eco-systems, regions, and countries.Needs and factors of natural resources management and strategies in agricultureAccording to (awareness, symmetry, strength, harmonization costs of) interests of agents associated with natural resources there are different needs for management of actions.For instance, Figure 4 presents management needs for effective supply of agro-ecosystem services. Here Farm 1 has to manage its efforts and relations with the Farm 2 since both 9receive services from the Ecosystem 1 and affect (positively or negatively) service supply of that ecosystem. Besides, both farms are to manage their relations with consumers of services from Ecosystem 1 (agents in Social system 1) to meet total demand and compensate costs for maintaining ecosystem services to that direction. In addition, Farms 1 and 2 have to coordinate efforts with agents in Social system 1 to mitigate conflicts with agents in Social system 2 (affecting negatively services of Ecosystem 1). Furthermore, Farm 1 is to manage its relations with Farm 3 for effective service supply from Ecosystem 3, and manage its interaction with Ecosystem 2. Moreover, Farms 1 and 3 have to manage their relations with Farms 4 and agents from Social system 1 (consumers of services of the Ecosystem 3) and Social system 2 (consumers and destructors of Ecosystem 3 services). Figure 4: Management needs for effective supply of agro-ecosystem servicesFinally, Farm 1 affecting adversely the Ecosystem 4 services is to manage relations with agents in Social system 2 (consumers of Ecosystem 4 services) to reconcile conflicts and secure effective flow of ecosystem services. Therefore, the Farm 1 is to be involved in sevensystems of governance in order to assure an effective supply of the services from ecosystems of which it belongs or affects. Most environmental activity and exchange in agriculture could be managed through a great variety of alternative forms. For instance, a supply of environmental preservation service could be governed as: voluntary activity of a farmer; though private contracts of the farmer with interested or affected agents; though interlinked contract between the farmer and a supplier or processor; though cooperation (collective action) with other farmers and stakeholders; though (free) market or assisted by a third-party (certifying and controlling agent) trade with special (eco, protected origins, fair-trade) products; though a public contract specifying farmer\u2019s obligations and compensation; though a public order (regulation, taxation, quota for use of resources/emissions); within a hierarchical public agency or by a hybrid form.Ecosystem 3Farm 1Ecosystem         2Farm 2Farm 3   Social system 1farmsbusinessesconsumersresidentsvisitorsinterest groupsFarm 4Ecosystem 1Ecosysys-tem 4Social system 2farmsbusinessesconsumersresidentsvisitorsinterest groups10Commonly natural and institutional environment evolve very slowly over a long-term periods. Therefore, in the specific natural, socio-economic and institutional environment, the choice of management mode would depend on a number of key factors including (Figure 5):- personal characteristics of individual agents \u2013 preferences, believes, ideology, knowledge, capability, training, managerial experience, risk-aversion, bounded rationality, tendency for opportunism, reputation, trust, power etc. For instance, benefits for farmers from eco-management could range from monetary or non-monetary income; profit; indirect revenue; to pleasure of involvement in environment and biodiversity preservation activity.Figure 5: Factors for managerial and strategy choices for agro-eco-management- formal and informal institutions - often the choice of management mode is (pre)determined by the institutional restrictions as some forms for carrying out farming, environmental etc. activities could be socially unacceptable or illegal . For instance, market trade of farmland, natural resources, and (some) eco-system services are not allowed.Furthermore, institutional environment considerably affects the level of management costs and thus the choice of one or another form of organization. For instance, in conditions of well-working public system of regulations (quality standards, guarantees) and laws and contract enforcement, a preference is given to spotlight and classical (standard) contracts. On the other hand, when rights on major agrarian and natural resources are not defined or not well defined, and absolute and contracted right effectively enforced, then high transaction costs could create difficulties (block) effective eco-management - costly unsolvable disputesbetween polluting and affected agents, disregards of interests of certain groups or generations etc. Consequently, the institutional structures for carrying out agrarian and environmental activities become an important factor, which eventually determines the outcome of the system (efficiency) and the type of development (sustainability).- natural and technological factors - eco-management strongly depends on the type of environmental challenge (spatial and temporal scale, risks etc.) and natural recoursesendowment as well as on the development of farming, environmental, monitoring, MarketInternalPublicHybridTRANSACTION            Institutional modernisationTechnological developmentContractCharacteristics of natural environmentCOSTPersonal characteristics11information etc. technologies. For instance, management of water resources depends on the advancement of water conservation, use, recycling and monitoring technologies etc.Efficiency of agro-eco-management and strategiesThe problem of \u201csocial costs\u201d does not exist in the conditions of zero transaction costs 3 and well defined private property rights [Coase]. Then the stahe of maximum efficiency is always achieved independent of initial distribution of rights between individuals and the mode of governance. All information for the effective potential of activity and exchange (optimization of resources, meeting various demands, respecting assigned and transferred rights) would be costlessly available to everybody. Individuals would costlessly coordinate their activities; define, adapt and implement their strategies, define new rights, and protect their (absolute and contracted) rights4, and trade owned resources (and rights over them) in mutual benefit with the same (equal) efficiency over free market (adapting to price movements), and private modes of different types (contracts, firms), and collective decision making (cooperative, association), and in a nationwide hierarchy (a single private or state company). Then ecological requirements for sustainability and technological opportunities for economies of scale and scope (the maximum environmental conservation/enhancement and productivity of resources, \u201cinternalization of externalities\u201d) and the maximum welfare (consumption, conservation of natural resources) would be easily/costlestly achieved5. However, when transaction costs are significant, then costless contracting, exchange and protection of individual right is impossible. Therefore, initial distribution of property rights between individuals and groups, and their good definition and enforcement are critical for overall efficiency and sustainability. For instance, if the \u201cright for clean and conserved natural environment\u201d is not well-defined, that creates big difficulties foe efficient eco-management \u2013 costly disputes between polluting and affected agents; not respecting interests of certain groups or generations etc.What is more, in conditions of well-defined rights, eco-management is usually associated with significant transaction costs. For example, agents have costs for identification and protection of various rights (unwanted take overs from others); studying out and complying with diverse institutional restrictions (norms, standards, rules); collecting needed technological, environmental etc. Information; finding best partners and prices; negotiating conditions of exchange; contract writing and registration; enforcing negotiated terms through monitoring, controlling, measuring and safeguarding; disputing through a court system or another way; adjusting or termination along with evolving conditions of production and exchange etc.                                                             3 The costs for governing relations between individuals \u2013 for protection and exchange of individual rights.4 When transaction costs are zero then definition (redistribution) of new rights of individuals, interests groups, and society as well as effective enforcement of the new rights would be easily achived. 5 Presently there is a principle agreement (\u201csocial contract\u201d) for global sustainable development. Nevertheless, depending on the specific social preferences that \u201csocial consensus\u201d not always is expressed in maximum environmental conservation and improvement. At certain stages of development the social priority could be given to the economc growth at the \u201cprice\u201d of certain degradation of natural respources - \u201eover\u201d pollution and emmisisions, unsustainable expoitation, partial or complete exsouthion (termination).12Therefore, in the real world with not completely defined and/or enforced rights, and positive transaction costs, the mode of agro-eco-governance is crucial and eventually (pre)determine the extent of degradation, conservation and improvement of natural resources [Bachev 2010]. That is because different modes have unequal efficiency (benefits, costs) for governing the same eco-activity in the specific socio-economic and natural environment. Moreover, often the high transaction costs deteriorate and even block organisation of otherwise efficient (mutually-beneficial) for all participants eco-activity and exchange.It has to be distinguished the transaction from the proper conservation/\u201cproduction\u201d(agronomic, opportunity etc.) environmental costs. In modern conditions the later are significant economic costs, which are to be recovered like other technological costs from the beneficiaries of conserved/improved natural environment. Often that is the farmer, who invest for maintaining productivity of natural resources (soil fertility, water purity, ecosystem services), and recover these costs similarly to other investments thought flow of future benefits (productivity, profitability, market position, etc.). More frequently, these are other agents, who pay for used eco-services directly (buying eco-products and services) or indirectly (though collective organisations, taxes and fees etc.).The effective modes for agro-eco-management optimise the total (transaction andconservation costs) for agrarian activity \u2013 minimizing transaction costs and allowing (otherwise mutual beneficial) eco-exchange to be carried out in a socially desirable scale, and allowing achievement of minimum/optimum environmental requirement and/or exploration of pure technological economies of scale and scope of farm, environmental conservation etc. activities.In very rare cases there is only one practically possible form for governing of natural resources, eco-activity and eco-exchange6. Usually, there are a number of alternative modes for governing of eco-conservation activity.Different management modes are alternative but not equally efficient modes for the organization of eco-activities. Each form has distinct advantages and disadvantages to protect eco-rights and investment, coordinate and stimulate socially desirable eco-behaviour and activities, explore economies of scale and scope, save production and transaction costs. For instance, the free market has a big coordination and incentive advantages (\u201cinvisible hand\u201d, \u201cpower of competition\u201d), and provides \u201cunlimited\u201d opportunities to benefit from specialization and exchange. However, market management could be associated with a high uncertainty, risk, and costs due to lack of (asymmetry) of information, low \u201cappropriability\u201d of some rights (\u201cpublic good\u201d character), price instability, a great possibility for facing an opportunistic behaviour, \u201cmissing market\u201d situation etc. The special contract form (\u201cprivate ordering\u201d) permits a better coordination and intensification of eco-activity, and safeguard of agent\u2019s eco-rights and eco-investments. However, it may require large costs for specification (and writing) contract provisions, adjustments with constant changes in conditions, enforcement and disputing of negotiated terms etc.                                                             6 For instance, in Japanese agriculture with small-scale paddy fiels organization of water supply could not be carried out by individual farms (high mutual assets dependency, non separability of water use). Therefore, since ancient time organization of water supply is governed as a public projects [Mori]. 13The internal organization allows a greater flexibility and control on activity (direct coordination, adaptation, enforcement, and dispute resolution by a fiat). However, extension of internal mode beyond family and small-partnership boundaries (allowing achievement of minimum technological or ecological requirements; exploration of technological economies of scale and scope) may command significant costs for development (initiation, design, formal registration, restructuring), and for current management (collective decision making, control on coalition members opportunism, supervision and motivation of hired labour). The separation of the ownership from the management (cooperative, corporation, public farm/firm) gives enormous opportunities for growth in productivity, environmentaland management efficiency \u2013 internal division and specialization of labour; achieving ecosystem\u2019s requirements; exploration of economies of scale and scope; introduction of innovation; diversification; risk sharing; investing in product promotion, brand names, relations with customers, counterparts and authorities. However, it could be connected with huge transaction costs for decreasing information asymmetry between management and shareholders, decision-making, controlling opportunism, adaptation etc. The cooperative and non-for profit form also suffers from a low capability for internal long-term investment due to non-for-profit goals and non-tradable character of shares (so called \u201chorizon problem\u201d). What is more, evolution and maintenance of large collective organisations is usual associated with significant costs \u2013 for initiating, informing, \u201ccollective| decision-making and internal conflict resolution, controlling opportunism of (current and potential) members, modernisation, restructuring, liquidation.Finally, the pubic forms also command high internal (internal administration and coordination) and outside (for other private and public agents) costs \u2013 for establishment, functioning, coordination, controlling, mismanagement, misuse by private and other agents, reorganisation, and liquidation. What is more, unlike market and private modes, for public organisations there is no automatic mechanism (competition) for selection of ineffective forms. Here it is necessary public \u201cdecision making\u201d which is associated with huge costs and time, and often affected  by strong private interests (power of lobbying groups, politicians and their associates, bureaucrats, employees in the public forms) rather than efficiency.Principally the \u201erational\u201d agents tend to use and/or design such modes for governing their diverse activity and relations which are the most efficient  in the specific institutional, economic and natural environment \u2013 forms maximizing their overall (production, ecological, financial, transaction etc.) benefits and minimizing their overall (production, environmental, transaction etc.) costs [Bachev 2010]. However, a result of such private strategies and optimization of management/activity is not always the most sociallyeffective distribution of resources and the socially desirable (maximum possible) conservation of natural resources. It is well-known that agricultural activity is often associated with significant undesirable negative environmental effects \u2013 soils degradation, waters pollution, biodiversity termination, air pollution, considerable green-house gases emissions etc.Therefore, the system of agro-eco-management is to be improved, and that frequently necessitates public (state) involvement in agrarian and environmental management.Nevertheless, public intervention in (eco)management is not always more effective, since public failure is practically possible. Around the globe there are many examples for inappropriate, over, under, delay, or too expensive public intervention at all levels. Often the public intervention either does not correct market and private sector failures, or \u201ccorrect| them with higher overall costs.14Thus the criterion for assessing the efficiency of agro-eco-management and strategies is to be whether socially desirable and practically possible environmental goals are realized with the minimum possible overall costs (direct, indirect, private, public, production, environmental, transaction etc.). Accordingly inefficiency is expressed either in failure to achieve  feasible (technically, politically, economically) environmental goals(conservation of natural resources, overcoming certain eco-problems, diminishing existing eco-risks, decreasing eco-losses, recovery and improvement of natural environment etc.) or achieving of set up goals with more costs comparing to another feasible form of management.Modern socio-economic, institutional and (more often) natural environment in changing very fast and often unpredictably7. Consequently, any strategy for effective management of natural resources conservation is to be adaptive strategy. Accordingly, dominating and other feasible (market, private, public, hybrid) forms are to be assessed in terms of their absolute and comparative (adaptation) potential of protect eco-rights and investments of agents, assure socially desirable level of environmental conservation (enhancement), minimize overall costs, coordinate and stimulate eco-activities, reconcile conflicts, and recover long-term costs for organizational development in the specific economic, institutional and natural environment.(The most) effective forms for agro-eco-managementUsually \u201cevolution\u201d of natural and institutional environment is quite slow and in long periods of time. Therefore, to a great extent the efficiency of the system of agro-eco-management will depend on the level of transaction costs.The transaction costs have behavioral origin: namely individual\u2019s bounded rationality and tendency for opportunism [Williamson]. Agrarian agents do not possess full information about the system (eco-benefits and costs, effects on others, formal requirements, development trends etc.) since collection and processing of such information would be either very expensive or impossible (multiple spilovers effects and costs in large geographical and temporal scale, future events, partners intention for cheating etc.). In order to optimize the decision-making and activity the agents have to spent costs for \u201cincreasing their imperfect rationality\u201d \u2013 for monitoring, data collection, analysis, forecasting, training, consulting etc.Besides, the economic agents are given to (pre-contractual, post-contractual, and non-contractual) opportunism. Accordingly, if there is opportunity for some of transacting sides to get non-punishably an extra benefit/rent from voluntary or unwanted exchange, he will likely take advantage of that. Usually it is very costly or impossible to distinguish opportunistic from non-opportunistic behavior because of the bounded rationality of agents. What is more, in the real life there is widespread non-contractual opportunism8,namely unwanted \u201cexchange\u201d or stealing of rights from a private and/or public agentswithout any contracting process (because of lack or asymmetry of information, capability for detection and protection, weak negotiating positions etc.).                                                            7 There have been many financial, economic, food, environmenta crisis in recent years inducing fundamental changes in economic structure and institutional rules at local, national, transnational and global scales. 8 Most economic analisis focuse on pre-contractual (\"adverse selection\") and post-contractual (\"moral hazard\") opportunism. Widely distributed non-contractual opportunism is usually ignored.15Therefore, individual agents have to protect their rights, investments and transactions from the hazard of opportunism through: ex ante efforts to find a reliable counterpart and to design efficient mode for partners credible commitments; ex post investments for overcoming (through monitoring, controlling, stimulating cooperation) of possible opportunism during contract execution stage; and permanent efforts/costs for protection from unwanted non-contractual exchange though safeguarding, diversification, cooperation, court suits etc.  Eco-opportunism is also widespread in agriculture. For instance, the farmer knows or eventually recognises that his activity is harmful for environment, but in order to save additional costs continues to execute risk operations when the negative effects are for other agents (owners of natural resources, other farms, non-agrarian agents, society as a whole).Or farmer sells conventional products as \u201corganic\u201d and profit price premium from unawarebuyers; or he joins the public agro-eco-programs to get subsidies, but does not comply with contracted eco-obligations9. Part of the transaction costs for eco-management could be determined relatively easily e.g. costs for licensing, certifications, tests, purchase of information, hiring consultants, payments for guards and lawyers, bribes etc. However, assessment of another (significant) part of transaction costs in eco-activity is often impossible or very expensive [Bachev, 2011a]. That is why comparative structural analysis is to be employed [Williamson]. This analysis would align eco-activities/transactions (which differ in their attributes) with the governance structures (which differ in their costs and competence) in discriminating (mainly transaction cost economizing) way. Frequency, uncertainty, assets specificity, and appropriability are identified as critical dimensions of eco-activity and transaction10 - the factors responsible to the variation of transacting costs between alternative modes of management.In the specific socio-economic and natural environment, depending to the combination of critical factors of eco-activities and eco-transactions, there will be different the most-effective forms of their management (Figure 6).Eco-activity and transactions with good appropriability of rights, high certainty, and universal character of investments could be effectively managed by free market through spotlight or classical contracts. For instance, there are widespread market modes for selling diverse ecosystem services and eco-products - eco-visits, organic, fair-trade, origins, self-production or self-pick up of yields from customer11, eco-education, eco-tourism, eco-restaurants etc.Frequent transactions with high appropriability could be effectively managed through a special contract. For example, eco-contracts and cooperative agreements between farmers and interested businesses or communities are widely used including a payment for ecosystem services, and leading to production methods (enhanced pasture management, reduced use of agrochemicals, wetland preservation etc.) protecting water from pollution, mitigating floods and wild fires etc.                                                             9 Not compliance with the terms of public eco-contracts by farmers is widespread even in some of the old member states of European Union. 10 Frequency, uncertainty\u201d, and asset specificity are identified as critical factors of transaction costs by Williamson [Williamson] while appropriability added by Bachev and Labonne [Bachev and Labonne].11 These type of services are very popular for residents of big Japanese cities. 16Figure 6: Principle modes for environmental management in agricultureGeneric modes                      Critical dimensions of transactions                                              Appropriability                                           High     Low                                           Assets Specificity           Low             High                                             Uncertainty       Low      High      Low        High                                             FrequencyHigh Low High Low High Low High LowFree market \uf086 \uf086Special contract form \uf086 \uf086Internal organization \uf086 \uf086Third-party involvement\uf068 \uf068Public intervention \uf068\uf086 - the most effective mode; \uf068 - necessity for a third party involvementWhen uncertainty is high and assets dependency (specificity) is symmetrical the relational (\u201cneoclassical\u201d) contract could be used. Since detailed terms of transacting and results are not known at outset (a high uncertainty), a framework (mutual expectations) rather than a specification of obligations of partners is practiced (opportunisms is(self)restricted due to the symmetrical dependency of investments of partners). A special contract forms is also efficient for rare transactions with a low uncertainty, high specificity and appropriability. Dependent investment could be successfully safeguarded through contract provisions since it is easy to define and enforce relevant obligations of partners in all possible contingencies (no uncertainty exist).Transactions and activity with high frequency, big uncertainty, and great assets specificity have to be managed within internal organization. For instance, a good portion of eco-investments are strongly specific to (certain land plots, eco-systems etc.) a farm and can be effectively implemented and \u201cpaid-back\u201d within the borders of the particular farm.The high interdependency (specificity) of eco-investments with other farm\u2019s assets and activity is the reason a great part of agro-eco-management to be executed by different type of farms \u2013 family, cooperative, agri-firms, public, hybrid.  Despite that there are cases when farms and other agents are specialised in eco-management and are entirely engaged in (aimed at) \u201ckeeping natural resources in a good condition\u201d or \u201crecovery or amelioration of natural environment\u201d. Here agricultural activity either does not exist (e.g. prolonged follow up) or it is practiced as far as it is required by purely agronomic, ecological and other (e.g. educational, rehabilitation etc.) needs. According to the extent of appropriability of results and the universal character of investments, these farms could be market-oriented (selling eco-services to landlords or other buyers), community12 (funded by communities, interests groups) or public (e.g. for conservation of important eco-systems like national parks, natural phenomenon etc.).                                                            12 In responre to the unprecedented decrease in number of farms in Japan a \u201cthird sector\u201d has developed  - in many places community farms are estanblished aiming at conservation of natural environment rather than farming.17Very often the effective scale of specific investment in agro-ecosystem services exceeds the borders of traditional agrarian organisations (family farm, small partnership).For instance, much of eco-investments, which are done in one farm (protection of waters and air, biodiversity etc.) benefit other farms or non-agrarian agents. Often, dependency of eco-investments of a farm is unilateral from the agent benefiting from the positive result.Besides, the positive impact of eco0investment often depends on the minimum scale of activity and frequently requires collective action (co0investment). Consequently, eco-activity/assets of many farms happen to be in a high mutual-dependency with the eco-activity/assets of other farms and other non-agrarian agents in a large spacial and often temporal scale.This if specific capital (knowledge, technology, equipment, funding) cannot be effectively organized within a single organization13, then effective external form(s) is to be used \u2013 e.g. joint ownership, interlinks, cooperative, joint investment in labels and origins, lobbying for public intervention etc. For instance, environmental cooperatives are very successful in some European countries where there are strong incentives for cooperation due to the mutual-dependency of farms eco-activity, evolving \u201cmarket\u201d for eco0services, and widespread application of long-term public eco-contracts for eco-coalition. There is rapid development of diverse association of producers around specific capital invested in eco-products and services, trademarks, advertisement, marketing channels etc.Nevertheless, costs for initiation and maintaining collective organization for overcoming unilateral dependency are usually great (big number of coalition, different interests of members, opportunism of \u201cfree-riding\u201d type) and it is unsustainable or does not evolve at all. That strongly necessitates a third-party involvement (non-governmental or state organisation) to make such organisation possible or more efficient.The transaction costs analysis let us identify situations of market and private sector failures. For instance, serious problems usually arise when condition of assets specificity is combined with high uncertainty and low frequency, and when appropriability is low. In all these cases, a third part (private agent, NGO, public authority) involvement in transactions is necessary (through assistance, arbitration, regulation, funding) in order to make them more efficient or possible at all. Emergence and unprecedented development of special origins, organic farming and system of fair-trade, are good examples in that respect. There is increasing consumer\u2019s demand (price premium) for these products but their supply could not be met unless effective trilateral management (including independent certification and control) is put in place.Respecting others rights or granting out additional rights could be managed by \u201cgood will\u201d or charity actions. For instance, a great number of voluntary environmental initiatives (\u201ccodes of behaviour\u201d) have emerged driven by farmers\u2019 preferences for eco-production, competition in industries, and responds to public pressure for a sound environmental management. However, voluntary and charity initiatives could hardly satisfy the entire social demand especially if they require considerable costs. Besides, environmental standards are usually \u201cprocess-based\u201d, and \u201cenvironmental audit\u201d is not conducted by independent party, which does not guarantee a \u201cperformance outcome\u201d 14.Most environmental management requires large organizations with diversified interests of agents (providers, consumers, destructors, interest groups etc.). Emergence of                                                             13 coalition made, minimum scale of operations reached, economy of scale and scope explored.14 The huge food safety and environmental pollution scandals in recent years proves that private shceems often fail (high information asymmetry and possibility for opportunism). 18special large-members organizations for dealing with low appropriability is slow and expensive, and they are not sustainable in long run (\u201cfree riding\u201d problem). Therefore, there is a strong need for a third-party public (Government, local authority, international assistance) intervention to make such eco-activity possible or more effective [Bachev 2010].For example, supply of \u201cenvironmental goods\u201d by farmers could hardly be governed through private contracts with individual consumers because of the low appropriability, high uncertainty, and rare character of transacting (high costs for negotiating, contracting, charging all potential consumers, disputing). At the same time, the supply of additional environmental protection service is very costly (in terms of production and organization costs) and would unlikely be carried out on a voluntary basis. Besides, the financial compensation of farmers by willing consumers through a pure market mode (eco-fee, eco-premium to price) is also ineffective due to the high information asymmetry, and massive costs for enforcement, disputing and excluding of \u201cdishonest\u201d users. A third-party mode with a direct public involvement would make that transaction effective: on behalf of the consumers the State agency negotiates with individual farmers a public contract for \u201cenvironment conservation service\u201d, coordinates activities of various agents, provides public payments for compensation of farmers, and controls implementation of negotiated terms15.Public modes and strategies for management of natural resources in agricultureIn modern agriculture there are a great variety in forms and efficiency of public intervention on agri-eco-management 16 . In assessment of public modes for agro-eco-management it has to be taken into account the overall (public and private) costs for implementation and transaction for achievement of social eco-goals in comparison with another practically possible form of intervention. The Discrete structural analysis is to be applied which would assist the assessment of efficiency and the design of forms and strategies of public intervention. Depending on uncertainty, frequency, and necessity forspecific investment of public involvement different form of public intervention will be the most efficient (Figure 7). Figure 7: Principle modes for public intervention in environmental management            Level of Uncertainty, Frequency, and Assets specificityLow                               \uf0ac-----------------------------------\uf0ae                                     HighNew property rights and enforcementsPublic regulationsPublic taxationPublic assistancePublicfundingPublicprovisionInterventions with a low uncertainty and assets specificity would normally require a smaller public organization - more regulatory modes, improvement of the general laws and contract enforcement etc. When uncertainty and assets specificity of transactions increases a special contract mode would be necessary \u2013 e.g. employment of public contracts for                                                             15 Public eco-contracts are the most widely used instrument for impriving agro-eco-activity in European Union. What is more, further \u201cgreening\u201d of the Common Agricultural Policies and augmentation of \u201ceco-subsidies\u201d is planed from 2014 on.16 For instance, review of diverse modes of governance of agro-ecosystem services is made by Bachev [2011a].19provision of private services, public funding (subsidies) of private activities, temporary labour contract for carrying out special public programs, leasing out public assets for private management etc. And when transactions are characterized with high assets specificity, uncertainty and frequency, then an internal mode and a bigger public organization would be necessary \u2013 e.g. permanent public employment contracts, in-house integration of crucial assets in a specialized state agency or public company etc. Initially, it is necessary to be specifies the ways to correct existing and emerging eco-problems in market and private sector (difficulties, costs, risks, failures). The appropriate public involvement would be to create an environment for: decreasing uncertainty surrounding market and private transactions, increasing intensity of exchange and cooperation, protecting private rights and investments, and making private investments less dependent. For instance, State establishes and enforces quality, safety and eco-standards for farm inputs and produces, certifies producers and users of natural resources, transfers water management rights to farms associations, sets up minimum farm-gate prices etc. (Table 1) All these facilitate and intensify private eco-initiatives and (market and private) eco-transactions and increase efficiency of economic organizations.  Next, practically possible modes for increasing appropriability of rights and results of activity and investment have to be considered. The low appropriability is often caused by unspecified or badly specified private rights [Bachev, 2004]. In that case, the most effective government intervention would be to introduce and enforce new private property rights \u2013 e.g. rights on natural, biological, and environmental resources; rights on issuing and trading eco-bonds and shares; tradable quotas for polluting; private rights on intellectual agrarian property and origins etc. That would be efficient when privatization of resources or the introduction and enforcement of new rights is not associated with significant costs (uncertainty, recurrence, and level of specific investment are low). Such public intervention effectively transfers the organization of transactions into the market and private management, liberalizes market competition and induces private incentives (and investments) in certain eco-activities. For instance, tradable permits (quotas) are used to control the overall use of certain resources or level of a particular type of pollution. They give flexibility allowing farmers to trade permits and meet their own requirements according to their adjustment costs, specific conditions of production etc. That form is efficient when a particular target must be met, and the progressive reduction is dictated through permits while trading allows the compliance to be achieved at least costs (through a private management). What is more, the tradable rights could be used a market for environmental quality to develop. The later let private agents to realise new eco-strategy purchasing permits from the market and taking them out of market turnover and utilisation. In that way the environmental quality could be practically raised above the initially \u201cplanned\u201d (by the Government) level, and would not have been achieved without these additional private eco-initiatives.In other instances, it would be more efficient to put in place regulations for trade and utilization of resources, products and services \u2013 e.g. standards for labour safety, product quality, environmental performance, animal welfare; norms for using natural resources, introduction of foreign species and GM crops, and (water, soil, air, comfort) contamination; a ban on application of certain chemicals or technologies; regulations for trading ecosystem service protection; foreign trade regimes; mandatory eco-training and licensing of farm operators etc. 20Table 1.

It makes producers responsible for the \u201cenvironmental effects\u201d (externalities) of their products or the management of products uses (e.g. waste). This mode is effective when a general improvement of the performance is desired but it is not possible to dictate what changes (in activities, technologies) is appropriate for a wide range of operators and environmental conditions (high uncertainty and information asymmetry). When the level of hazard is very high, the outcome is certain and the control is easy, and no flexibility exists (for timing or the nature of socially required result), then the bans or strict limits are the best solution. However, the 21regulations impose uniform standards for all regardless of the costs for compliance (adjustment) and give no incentives to over-perform beyond a certain (regulated) level. In other instances, using the incentives and restrictions of tax system would be the most effective form for public intervention. Different sorts of tax preferences (exception, breaks, credits) are widely used to create favourable conditions for certain (sub)sectors and regions, forms of agrarian organization, or specific types of activities. The environmental taxation on emissions or products (inputs or outputs of production) is also applied to reduce the use of harmful substances. Eco-taxes impose the same conditions for all farmers using a particular input and give signals to take into account the \u201cenvironmental costs\u201d inflicted on the society as a whole (or big communities of affected individuals). Taxing is effective when there is a close link between the activity and the environmental impact, and when there is no immediate need to control the pollution or to meet the targets for reduction. However, an \u201cappropriate\u201d level of the charge is required to stimulate a desirable change in farmers\u2019 behaviour. Furthermore, some emissions (e.g. nitrogen) vary according to the conditions of application (fertilisation with N) and attempting to reflect this in tax system often result in complexity and high administrating costs. In some cases, a public assistance and support to private organizations is the best mode for intervention. The public financial support for environmental actions is the most commonly used instrument for improving environment performance of farmers. It is easy to find an economic justification for the public payments as a compensation for the provision of an \u201cenvironmental service\u201d by farmers. However, the share of farms participating in various agri-environmental support schemes has not been significant. That is a result of voluntary (self-selection) character of this mode which does not attract farmers with the highest environment enhancement costs (most intensive and damaging environment producers). In some countries the low-rate of farmers\u2019 compliance with the environmental contracts is a serious problem17. The later cannot be solved by augmented administrative control (enormous enforcement costs) or introducing bigger penalty (politically and juridical intolerable measure). Principally, it is estimated that the agri-environmental payments are efficient in maintaining the current level of environmental capital but less successful in enhancing the environmental quality. Another disadvantage of \u201cpayment system\u201d is that once introduced it is practically difficult (\u201cpolitically unacceptable\u201d) to be stopped when goals are achieved or there are funding difficulties. Moreover, withdraw of subsidies may lead to further environmental harm since it would induce the adverse actions (intensification, return to conventional farming strategies). Other critics of subsidies are associated with their \u201cdistortion effect\u201d, negative impact on \u201centry-exit decisions\u201d from polluting industry, unfair advantages to certain sectors in the country or industries in other countries, not considering the total costs (such as transportation and environmental costs, \u201cdisplacement effect\u201d in other countries). Often providing public information, recommendations, training and education to farmers, rural agents, and consumers are the most efficient form since they improve their capability and strategies. In some cases, a pure public organization (in-house production, public provision) will be the most effective one as it is in the case of important agro-ecosystems and national parks; agrarian research, education and extension; agro-meteorological forecasts; border sanitary and veterinary control etc.Usually, effective implementation of a long-term natural resources conservationstrategy requites combined public intervention (a governance mix). The necessity of                                                             17 40% of French farmers experience problems implementing public eco-contracts [Dupraz \u0435t al.].22multiple public intervention is caused by the fact that: different natural resources and diverse challenges associated with them need different instruments and form of public intervention; individual modes are effective if they are applied alone with other modes;frequently the combined effect is higher that sum of individual effects; thecomplementarities (joint effect) of individual forms; restricted potential of some less expensive forms to achieve a certain (but not the entire) level of socially preferred outcome; possibility to get an extra benefits (e.g. \u201ccross-compliance\u201d requirement for participation in public programs); particularity of problems to be tackled; specific critical dimensions of managed activity; uncertainty (little knowledge, experience) associated with likely impact of new forms; needs for \u201cprecaution\u201d; practical capability of State to organize (administrative potential to control, implement) and fund (direct budget resources and/or international assistance) different modes; and dominating (right, left) policy doctrine. Besides, the level of an effective public intervention (management) depends on the scale of ecosystem and type of problem. There are public involvements which are to be executed at local (farm, agro-ecosystem, community, regional) level, while others require nationwide management. There are also activities, which are to be initiated and coordinated at international (regional, European, worldwide) level due to the strong necessity for trans-border actions (needs for a cooperation in natural resources and environment management, for exploration of economies of scale/scale, for prevention of ecosystem disturbances, for governing of spill-overs) or consistent (national, local) government failures. Often the effective governance of many challenges and risks of agro-ecosystems requite multilevel management with combined actions of different levels, and involving various agents, and different geographical and temporal scale.The public (regulatory, inspecting, provision etc.) modes must have built special mechanisms for increasing competency (decrease bounded rationality and powerlessness) of bureaucrats, beneficiaries, interests groups and public at large as well as restricting possible opportunism (opportunity for cheating, interlinking, abuse of power, corruption) of public officers and other stakeholders. That could be made by training, introducing new monitoring, assessment and communication technologies, increasing transparency (e.g. independent assessment and audit), and involving experts, beneficiaries, and interests groups in management of public modes at all levels. Furthermore, applying \u201cmarket like\u201dmechanisms (competition, auctions) in public projects design, selection and implementation would significantly increase the incentives and decrease the overall costs. Principally, a pure public organization should be used as a last resort when all othermodes do not work effectively [Williamson]. \u201cIn-house\u201d public organization has higher (direct and indirect) costs for setting up, running, controlling, reorganization, and liquidation. What is more, unlike market and private forms there is not automatic mechanism (competition) for sorting out the less effective modes 18 . Here a public \u201cdecision making\u201d is required which is associated with high costs and time, and it is often influenced by strong private interests (power of lobbying groups, policy makers and their associates, employed bureaucrats) rather than the efficiency. What is more, widespread \u201cinefficiency by design\u201d of public modes is practiced to secure (rent-taking) positions of certain interest groups, stakeholders, bureaucrats etc. Along with development of general institutional environment (\u201cThe Rule of Law\u201d, transparency) and monitoring, measurement, communication etc. technologies, the efficiency of pro-market modes                                                             18 It is not rare to see highly inefficient but still \u201csustainable\u201c public organizations around the world.23(regulation, information, recommendation) and contract forms would get bigger advantages over the internal less flexible public arrangements. Usually hybrid modes (public-private partnership) are much more efficient than pure public forms given coordination, incentives, and control advantages. In majority of cases, involvement of farmers, farmers organizations and other beneficiaries increases efficiency - decreases asymmetry of information, restricts opportunisms, increases incentives for private costs-sharing, and reduces management costs [Bachev, 2004]. For instance, a hybrid mode would be appropriate for carrying out the supply of preservation of environment, biodiversity, landscape, historical and cultural heritages etc. That is determined by the farmers information superiority, strong interlinks of activity with traditional food production (economy of scope), high assets specificity to the farm (farmers competence, high cite-specificity of investments to the farm and land), and spatial interdependency (needs for cooperation of farmers at a regional or wider scale), and not less important \u2013 farm\u2019s origin of negative externalities. Furthermore, enforcement of most labour, animal welfare, biodiversity etc. standards is often very difficult or impossible at all. In all these cases, stimulating and supporting (assisting, training, funding) private voluntary actions are much more effective then mandatory public modes in terms of incentive, coordination, enforcement, and disputing costs.  If there is a strong need for a third-party public involvement but an effective (government, local authority, international assistance) intervention is not introduced in a due time, then the agrarian \u201cdevelopment\u201d is substantially deformed. Consequently, all class of socially needed eco-activities and investment are blocked, natural resources are degradated or pollutes in large scales, sustainability of farms structures in reduces etc.Stages in analysis of environmental management and strategies in agricultureAnalysis and improvement of public agro-eco-management and strategies is to include following stages (Figure 8):First, assessment of specific management needs of conservation of natural resources utilized and/affected by agriculture. The later depends on particular characteristics of diverse natural resources and ecosystems they are part of, and the number, interests and strategies of related agents (example in Figure 4).For instance, persistence of serious eco-problems and risks is an indicator that an effective system of eco-management is not put in place. Therefore, trends, factors, problems, and risks associated with natural environment and its individual elements (land, water, air, biodiversity, eco-systems, climate etc.) are to be identified. Modern science offers quite precise methods to assess the state of environment, and detect existing, emerging and likely challenges - environmental changes, degradations, destructions and depletion of natural resources, eco-risks etc. [MEA]. o What is more, science offers reliable instruments to estimate agricultural contribution to and impact on the state (\u201chealth\u201d) of environment and its different components, including in different spatial and temporal scales. For instance, there are widespread applications of 24numerous eco-indicators for pressure, state, respond, and impact as well as for integral assessment of agrarian environmental sustainability [FAO, 2010a]. Figure 8: Stages in analysis and improvement of public agro-eco-management  The lack of serious eco-problems, conflicts and risks is an indicator that there is an effective system for eco-management, and therefore there is no need for changing public strategy for natural resources conservation. However, usually there are significant or growing environmental problems and risks associated with agriculture in developed and developing countries alike.Second, assessment is to be made on efficiency and potential of available and other feasible modes and mechanisms of management for natural resources conservation, and for overcoming existing, emerging and likely eco-problems and risks associated with agriculture. The analysis is to embrace the system of agro-eco-management and its individual components \u2013 institutional environment and various (formal, informal, market, private, contract, internal, individual, collective, public, specialized, multifunctional, simple, complex, etc.) forms for governing eco-activities of agrarian agents (farms of different type). In fact most analyses are restricted to a certain form (formal, farm, cooperative, public program) ignoring other important, dependent, or complementary modes. Efficiency of individual modes are to be evaluated in terms of their strategies and (comparative) potential to safeguard and develop agents eco-rights and investments, stimulate socially desirable level of environment protection behavior and activity, rapid detection of eco-problems and risks, cooperation and reconciliation of eco-conflicts, and to save and recover total environmental (conservation, recovery, enhancement, transaction, direct, indirect, private, public etc.) costs. Furthermore, efficiency of individual forms cannot be fully understood without analyzing the complementarities and/or contradictions between different forms and strategies \u2013 e.g. the high complementarities between (some) private, market and public forms for eco-management; conflicts between the \u201cgray\u201d and \u201clight\u201d sector of agriculture etc.Most assessments include only direct, production (eco-recovery, eco-maintenance, eco-enhancement), or program (international assistance, taxpayer) costs. Analysis is to include all Identification of environmental management needs, problems, and risksAssessing efficiency of available/feasible modes, and indentifying needs for public interventionAssessing comparative efficiency of alternative modes forpublic intervention, and selecting the best one(s)25(social) costs associated with different forms of eco-management \u2013 private, third-party, public, current, long-term, production, transaction etc. In addition to proper individual and third-party production (technological, agronomic, ecological etc.) costs, the eco-management is usually associated with significant transaction (governance) costs. Efficiency checks are to be performed periodically even when the system of agro-eco-management \u201cworks well\u201d. That is because the good conservation of natural resources could be done at excessive social costs or further improvement of environment may be done at the same social costs. In both cases there is alternative more efficient organization of agro-eco-management - e.g. too expensive for taxpayer state eco-management (in terms of incentives, total costs, adaptation and investment potential) could be replaces with more effective private, market or hybrid mode (public-private partnership).Usually assessments are limited to absolute efficiency of individual forms of eco-management (related costs, environmental effects) ignoring their comparative efficiencies. The analysis is to incorporate both absolute and comparative (in relation to other feasible modes) efficiency of diverse management modes. Comprehensive analysis let determine deficiencies (\u201cfailures\u201d) in dominating market, private, and public modes to manage effectively existing, emerging and likely eco-problems and risks, and specify the needs for (new) public intervention in agrarian eco-management.They could be associated with; impossibility for achieving socially desirable and practically possible environmental goals, significant transaction difficulties (costs) of participating agents, inefficient utilization of public money and resources etc.Third, alternative and practically possible modes for new public intervention able to correct (market, private and public) failures are to be identified, their comparative efficiencyand complementarities assessed, and the most efficient one(s) selected. Only technically, economically, and politically feasible modes of new public intervention in environmental management are to be specified. Their comparative (goal achieving, coordinating, stimulating, costs-minimizing) efficiency to and complementarities with other practically possible modes of public involvement (assistance, public-private partnership, property rights modernization etc.) is to be assessed, and the best one(s) introduced. Public modes not only support (market and private) transaction, but are also associated with significant (public and private) costs. Therefore, assessment is to comprise all costs for implementation and transaction - direct (tax payer, assistance agency) expenses, and transacting costs of bureaucracy (for coordination, stimulation, control of opportunisms and mismanagement), and costs for individuals\u2019 participation and usage of public modes (adaptation, information, paper works, payments of fees, bribes), and costs for community control over and for reorganization of bureaucracy (modernization, liquidation), and (opportunity) costs of public inaction19.                                                            19 Some of the environmental losses are expressed in economic terms (e.g. decline in income in related industries, replacement and recovery costs, negative effects on human welfare). However, a significant part of the social value cannot be expressed in monetary terms \u2013 e.g. negative impact in biodiversity, other ecosystems, human health, future generations etc.26Suggested analysis is to be made at different levels (farm, eco-system, regional, sectors, national, international) according to the type of eco-challenge and the scale of collective actions necessary to mitigate specific eco-problems and risks for each component of the natural environment (soils waters, air, etc.) and integrally for the natural environment as a whole. It is not one time exercise completing in the last stage with a perfect system of eco-management. It is rather a permanent process which is to improve eco-management along with the evolution of natural environment, individual and communities (social) awareness and preferences, and modernization of technologies and institutional environment. Besides, public (local, national, international) failure is also possible (and often prevail) which brings us into the next cycle in improvement of eco-management in agriculture.The comparative institutional analysis let define the efficiency and the potential of divers mechanisms and modes of management to deal with diverse problems and risks associated with the natural environment. Moreover, it let improve the design of the new forms of public intervention according to the specific market, institutional and natural environment of a particular farms, eco-system, region, sub-sector, country, and in terms of perfection of coordination, adaptation, information, stimulation, restriction of opportunism, controlling (in short \u2013 minimizing transaction costs) of participating actors (decision-makers, implementers, beneficiaries, other stakeholders). What is more, that analysis unable us to predict likely cases of new public (local, national, international) failures due to impossibility to mobilize sufficient political support and necessary resources and/or ineffective implementation of otherwise \u201cgood\u201d policies in the specific socio-economic environment of a particular country, region, sub-sector etc. Since public failure is a feasible option its timely detection permits foreseeing the persistence or rising of certain environmental problems, and informing (local, international) community about associated risks.3. Evolution of natural resource conservation management and strategies in Bulgarian agricultureInstitutional environment During most of transition, rights on agrarian resources (farmland, water) and diverse eco-rights (on clean, aesthetic nature; preservation of nature resources, biodiversity) were not defined or were badly defined and enforced (Table 2). Inefficient public enforcement of laws, and absolute and contracted rights was common. That has negative consequences on the development of farming structures and efficiency of eco-management [Bachev, 2010a].Privatization of farmland and assets of ancient public farms took almost 10 years to complete. During a good part of that period, the management of critical agrarian resources was in ineffective and \u201ctemporary\u201d structures (organizations under privatization, liquidation or reorganization; Land commissions etc.) with no interests in effective and sustainable exploitation. Besides, short-term lease of natural resources and material assets was a major form for the farm extension [Bachev, 2010a].27Table 2.

There was no modern system for monitoring the state of soil, water, and air quality, and credible information on the extent of environmental degradation. There was no awareness of the \u201cconcept\u201d of sustainable development and any needs to include it in the public policy, and private and community agenda. The lack of \u201cculture of sustainability\u201d has also impeded the evolution of voluntary measures, and private and collective actions (and institutions) for effective eco-management.Before the EU accession, country\u2019s laws, standards and institutions were harmonized with the Community Acquis. That introduced a modern framework for eco-governance including new rights (restrictions) on protection of environment, integrated territory, water and biodiversity management, preservation of traditional varieties and breeds, animal welfare, polluter pay principle s well as corresponding control, monitoring, and assessment institutions (e.g. Executive Environmental Agency, Hydro-melioration Agency  etc.).28The EU accession introduces and enforces a \u201cnew order\u201d - strict regulations and control; tough quality and environmental standards; financial support for eco-conservation and market instability etc. Huge European markets are opened which enhances competition and lets local farms explore their comparative advantages (low costs, high quality, specificity and purity of produce) and give strong incentives for investments in farm modernization and conforming to high product, technology and eco-standards. The external demand, monitoring, pressure, and sanctions by the EU lead to better enforcement of laws and standards. Internal collective actions and social demand for good governance have also got momentum leading to improvement of public management \u2013 e.g. success of eco-organizations putting a 5-year ban on GM crops, timely reaction against eco-violation in protected zones, revoking unlawful \u201cexchanges\u201d of valuable public lands etc.Nevertheless, new \u201crules of the game\u201d have not been clearly understood by publicauthorities, private organizations and individuals. There is not yet readiness for effective implementation of new public order because of the lack of information and experience or administrative capacity (lack of comprehension, deficient court system, corruption). Often, enforcement of eco-standards is difficult since costs for detection and penalizing of offenders are high, or there is no direct links between the performance and eco-impact \u2013 e.g. banned fields burning after harvesting is still widespread in the country [EEA, 2010]. The institutional modernization has been also associated with new conflicts between diverse private, collective and social interests. However, the results of the public choices have not always been for the advantage of effective eco-management. For instance, strong lobbying efforts of certain private groups and businesses led to a 20% reduction in numbers and 50% reduction in the area of initially identified sites for pan-European network NATURA 2000 [MWE].Private modes and strategies of eco-managementNewly evolving market and private structures were inefficient in dealing with various economic and eco-issues. Privatization of farmland and assets of ancient public farms took 10 years to complete while some state assets (e.g. irrigation, services etc.) were not effectively reorganised until recently. During much of the period, the management of farmland, land related assets (permanent crops; buildings; irrigation, drainage and flood protection facilities), eco-systems and water-resources, was in ineffective \u201ctemporary\u201d structures (organisation under privatisation, liquidation or reorganisation; Privatization Boards, Liquidation Councils, Land Commissions etc.). Sales and long-term lease markets for land and other natural resources did not emerge until 2000, and annual leasing was the major form for management until recently. That was combined with high economic and institutional uncertainty and a big inter-dependency of agrarian assets [Bachev, 2010a].Much of the farming activities were carried in inefficient and unsustainable structures \u2013public farms, part-time and subsistence farms, production cooperatives, and huge business farms based on provisional lease-in contracts (Table 3). Most livestock holdings are also miniature \u201cunprofessional\u201d breading the majority of animals in the country (Table 4).29Table 3.

Despite some augmentation of average farm size, the share of abandoned agricultural lands and primitive domestic livestock operations has been considerable from the beginning of transition now.Dominating modes for carrying out farming activities have had little incentives for current and long-term investment to enhance productivity and environmental performance [Bachev, 2008]. The cooperative\u2019s big membership makes individual and collective control on management very difficult and costly. That focuses managerial efforts on short-term indicators, gives a great possibility for mismanagement and using cooperatives in the best private (managers and associates) interests. Besides, there are differences in the investment preferences of diverse coops members due to the non-tradable nature of the cooperative shares (\u201chorizon problem\u201d). Given the fact that most members are small shareholders, older in age, and non-permanent employees, the incentives for long-term investment for land improvement, environmental conservation, and renovation of material and biological assets have been low. \u201cMember-oriented\u201d (non-for-profit) nature of the cooperatives also prevents them to adapt to diversified needs of members, and market demand and competition.On the other hand, small-scale and subsistent farms20 possess insignificant internal capacity for investment, and small potential to explore economy of scale and scope (big fragmentation and inadequate scale). Besides, they have little incentives for non-productive environment and biodiversity conservation, animal welfare etc. spending. Moreover, there has been neither administrative capacity nor a political will to enforce the quality and eco-standards in that vast informal sector of the economy. Primitive technologies and low compliance with modern agronomic, safety and eco-standards are widespread. Dairy sector is particularly vulnerable since only one-third of holdings meet formal EU standards [MAF].Larger business farms operate mainly on leased land and concentrate on high pay-off investment with a short pay-back period (e.g. cereals, sunflower). They are more sensitive to market demand and institutional regulations since largely benefit or lose from timely adaptation to new standards and market preferences. Besides, these enterprises have higher capacity to fund and adapt to new formal and market requirements. However, until recently, there has been no effective outside (authority, community) pressure for respecting eco-rules by the business enterprises.Restructuring of commercial farms continues as most of them apply survival tactics (\u201cconcentration on products with secure marketing\u201d) rather than a long-term strategy toward sustainability (preserving soil fertility, observing crop rotation and agro-techniques requirements) (Figure 9). What is more, a great portion of subsistent, smaller commercial farms and cooperatives are unable to adapt to evolving market, institutional and natural environment \u2013 intensified market competition; new EU quality, safety, and eco-standards;                                                             20 Subsistence and semi-market farms comprise the best part of farms as almost 1 million are involved in farming mostly on a part-time base and for \u201csupplementary\u201d income [MAF].31challenges associated with climate change etc. Our survey has found out that more than a quarter of farms are with a low potential for adaptation to new state and EU quality, safety, and environmental standards, almost 37% of them are less adaptable to market demand, prices and competition, and every other one is inadaptable to evolving natural environment (warning, extreme weather, droughts, floods, etc.).Figure 9: Share of farms implementing different strategies in Bulgaria (percent)Source: interviews with farm managers, 2010Medium-term sustainability of farms is estimated as low for unregistered holdings, grazing livestock, and pigs and poultry farms (Figure 10). Less that 7% of all farms \u201cforecast\u201d a high sustainability. A particular type of firms (companies) is the only exception where majority of enterprises envisages being highly sustainable in years to come. The later reflects both the environmental sustainability and the ability of holdings to manage eco-projects.Smaller size, owner operating and extensive nature of majority of farms let avoid certain problems of large public enterprises from the past such as over-intensification, lost natural landscape, biodiversity, nitrate and pesticide contamination, huge livestock and manure concentration, and uncontrolled erosion. Subsistent and small-scale farming has also revived some traditional and more sustainable technologies, varieties, and products, and avert Mad cow disease and Avian flu epidemic.Private mode has introduced incentives and possibilities for integral eco-management (including revival of eco- and cultural heritage; anti-pollution, esthetic, an comfort measures), investing in eco-system services, origins, labels, and profiting from inter-dependent activities such as farming, fishing, agro-tourism, processing, and marketing. There are good examples for private introduction and enforcement of quality and eco-standards by individual farms (voluntary and trade initiatives), a vertical integrator (dairy and vine processor, retailer, exporter), or a foreign investor (cereals, oil crops).0 20 40 60 80Produce products with secure marketingFollow agro-techniquesUse specialized experts assistance Put fertilizers and keep rotationInterested only in current yieldTry to keep soil fertility  CooperativesPrivate farms32Figure 10: Share of farms with different levels of medium-term sustainability in BulgariaSource: interviews with farm managers, 2010 Private management is associated with improved environmental stewardship on owned and marketed resources, but less concern to manure and garbage management, over-exploitation of leased and common resources, and contamination of soils, waters and air. The process of farms adaptation leads to intensification of production which could revive or deepen some eco-problems unless a pro-environmental management is put in place. Moreover, free market management of giant and semi-monopoly servicing (water, insurance etc.) companies usually comes with unfavourable pricing and terms for majority of farms.In 1990s the State monopoly \u201cIrrigation Systems\u201d was reorganized into a Joint-stock company owned by the Ministry of Agriculture and responsible for the management of state assets, provision of irrigation and drinking water, drainage and flood protection. Furthermore, the Union of Water Users was initiated and 176 Water User Associations (WUA) emerged. This collective form was unable to improve efficiency (low incentives, lack of ownership) and deal with monopoly position of 21 semi-autonomous regional branches of Irrigation Systems.  Since 2001 the user-rights on irrigation assets of Irrigation Systems have been freely transferred to newly-reestablished WUA. Around 70 WUA are formed servicing 30% of the total equipped for irrigation area. However, expected \u201cboom\u201d in efficiency from collective management of irrigation has not materialized because of the semi-monopoly situation (terms, pricing) of regional water suppliers, few incentives for water users to innovate facilities and expand irrigation, and uncompleted privatization of state assets (Bachev, 2011). Evolution of various farmers and eco-associations in the country has been hampered by the big number and diversified interests of agents \u2013 a different ownership size, operation, type of farming, preferences, age, and horizon. However, there are few examples for effective agrarian organizations mostly with small-membership and strong common interests of participants (e.g. tobacco, silk-warm, bee-honey etc.). Furthermore, in recent years some environmental organisations have been quite successful in eco-monitoring, campaigns against GM crops cultivation and removal of restrictions in protected areas, and other actions such as garbage cleaning.  For instance, among other activities Bulgarian Association of Bird Protection monitors the birds species varieties and numbers in different type of territories.0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%All farmsUnregisteredCooperativesFirms (total)Sole TradersCorporationsField cropsMix crop-livestockMix cropsMix livestockGrazing livestock Pigs and poultryPermanent cropsVegetablesLowGoodHigh33Market modesMarket-driven organic farming has emerged recently and registered a significant growth. There has been 11 folds increase in the number of organic operators  since 2003, and the organic producers comprise the largest part (74%) of the organic operators totaling 432 farms, processors, and traders [EUROSTAT]. There is enormous augmentation of organic areas and livestock but they are a tiny portion of the Utilized Agricultural Area (UAA) and livestock (Table 5). \u201cFully converted organic areas\u201d accounts for 25.4% of total organic areas with Industrial crops, Pastures and meadows, and Permanent crops comprising the biggest shares of fully converted areas [EUROSTAT]. There are few livestock farms and apiaries certified for bio-production with highest growth in organic goats and sheep, and a lion share of bees. There are also 242677 ha approved for gathering of wild organic fruits and herbs [MAF].Table 5.

Produced bio-fruits, vegetables, oil plants, herbs, spices, and honey are mostly for export since a tiny market for organic products exists in the country. The slow development of organic market is caused by the high prices of products, and limited consumer confidence in the authentic character of products and certification. Eco-labeling of processed farm products (self-regulation) has also appeared but it is perceived more as a part of the marketing strategy of companies rather than a genuine eco-action. What is more, (free) market management of semi-monopoly servicing companies comes with unfavorable pricing and terms for farmers, and only few among them purchase water or insurance against natural disasters (draughts, floods etc).Public modesDuring the transitional period public (Government and local authority) intervention in environmental management was not significant, comprehensive, sustainable, or even related [Bachev, 2008]. Eco-policies were fragmented and reactive to urgent problems (natural disasters) with different agencies responsible for individual aspects of eco-management. 34In passed years a number of national programs have been developed to deal with specific eco-challenges such as: preservation of biodiversity and environment; limitation of emissions of Sulphur Dioxide, VOC, Ammonia; waste management; development of water sector; combating climate change; developing organic agriculture; management of lands and fights against desertification; agrarian and rural development etc. National monitoring systems of environment and biodiversity are also set up, and mandatory eco-assessment of public programs introduced. Nevertheless, actual eco-policies rest fragmented and largely reactive to urgent eco-problems (floods, storms, drought) rather that based on a long-term strategy for sustainable development. As a result of inefficient priority setting, management and enforcement (bad coordination, gaps, incompetence, ineffective enforcement, corruption), and administrative capability21 a minor impact of public programs prevails.National expenditures for protection and restoration of environment are merely 1.9% of GDP, and agriculture is getting a tiny portion of the total public eco-spending [MEW]. What is more, recent financial and economic crisis further deteriorated funding of public (including environmental) projects. For instance, recultivation of degradated farmlands by MAF was initiated recently but it accounts only for 200-250 ha per year [EEA, 2010]. Similarly, serious eco-challenge is still caused by the state deficiency in storing and disposal of out-of-dated pesticides which are responsible for a good part of all polluted localities in the country [EEA, 2010]. There has been a numerous international (UN, EU, NGOs etc.) assistance projects to \u201cfill the gap\u201d in local failures but they have been limited in scale, unsustainable in time; often overtaken by local groups, funding improperly used; and with no significant positive impact. Agrarian education and the National Agricultural Advisory Service (NAAS) has not been effectively reorganized and provide modern and continues training on rural development and eco-, climate change, and water-management issues. They do not reach all agents via effective methods of education, advice and information suited to the specific needs of different agents. Furthermore, the integral approach of soil, water and biodiversity management in planning, funding, management, monitoring, controlling and assessment is not applied, and stakeholders involved in decision-making process at all levels. Neither modern eco-system services, life-cycle, water accounts, and other modern approaches have been incorporated into program management. Environmental data collection and monitoring have significantly improved in the last few years caching up with the modern EU standards. However, adequate information and independent assessment has not been secured yet and include: agricultural benefits and impacts; waters quality; total costs; eco- and water-foot prints; impacts of climate change; existing and likely risks etc. Nor mechanisms for timely disclosure and effective communication of data to decision-makers, stakeholders and public at large are assured.                                                             21 e.g. due to organizational and financial reasons Ministry of Water and Environment often does not get the relevant water information from the institutes of Bulgarian Academy of Sciences [EEA, 2010].35Agrarian and environment related research has not been modernized and severely underfunded in last twenty years. Consequently, agro-environmental innovation as well as the understanding of the agricultural use and impacts on natural environment, and various aspects, factors and efficiency of eco-management greatly deterred. Furthermore, during most of the transition agrarian long-term credit market was practically blocked while newly evolving farming structures left unassisted by the government. Until 2000 the Aggregate Level of Support to Agriculture was close to zero, and very small afterward [Bachev, 2010a]. Besides, the multifunctional role of farming was not recognized, and the provision of \u201cenvironmental service\u201d funded by society.There has been enormous progress in public support in recent years \u2013 e.g. National Fund Agriculture, EU Special Pre-accession Program for Agrarian and Rural Development (SAPARD), EU CAP measures etc.  SAPARD introduced measure \u201cAgro-ecology\u201d but it was not approved by the end 2006 and few projects were actually supported. In 2008 EC suspended SAPARD due to mismanagement and a significant funding lost.EU accession brought new opportunities for public support to private and collective agrarian and eco-activities. CAP and the National Plan for Agrarian and Rural Development 2007-2013 (NPARD) provide significant funding for EU area-based payments and national top-ups; agro-environmental measures (organic farming, management of agricultural lands with high natural value and handicaps, traditional livestock, protection of soils and water, preservation of landshaft); modernization of farms, processing, and marketing; diversification of activity; infrastructural development; keeping traditions; training etc. Specialized budget of NPARD directed for various eco-measures accounts for 27% of the total. Funding for eco- and other projects is also available from EU Fund LIFE+ and the Operational Programs \u201cEnvironment\u201d, \u201cFishery and Aquaculture\u201d, and \u201cRegional Development\u201d.The \u201ccross-compliance\u201d (with safety, animal-welfare, environmental etc. standards) for receiving a public support has been also introduced. Consequently, area-based direct payments and other subsidies improved farms income and eco-performance, induced farming on abandoned lands, and brought about some amelioration of environmental situation. However, it becomes difficult to reform the inefficient system of management of public programs. In 2007 no public payment was made for projects associated with NPARD measures but area-based payments for regions with handicaps. Progression in the implementation of public support has been slow and far behind the targets (Table 6). While measures \u201cSetting up of young farmers\u201d and \u201cPayments to farmers in regions with handicaps\u201d are successful, the number of approved and funded projects in other areas is insignificant.Due to the restrictive criteria22, lack of formal land management titles, complicated and costly procedures, and widespread mismanagement, the new public support is not effectively utilized and benefits unevenly different farms. Mostly bigger farms participate in public                                                             22 For area-based payments the minimum farm size is 1 ha (for permanent crops 0.5 ha), and for agro-ecological payments 0.5 ha, while landless livestock holdings are not-eligible for these type of support.36programs because of the superior entrepreneurial experience, available resources, and capability for adaptation to formal requirements and for wining projects.

At the same time, many effective small-scale farms receive no or only a tiny fraction of the public support. For instance, despite it increased number only 24% of all farms currently receive area based payments, and merely 6% of cattle holdings, 4% of sheep and pig holdings, and 3% of poultry farms [MAF]. Moreover, less than 7% of beneficiaries get the lion share (more than 80%) of all direct payments. Similarly, around 2% of the biggest farms (more than 500 ha) manage around 60% of supported by the environmental measures 211 and 212 areas [MAF].  The overall support to agriculture continues to rest low, and a small proportion of farms benefits from public aid most of them being large enterprises from regions with less socio-economic and eco-problems. Experts assessment indicates that there is a good or significant impact of CAP implementation on economic, social and environmental sustainability of large farms, agri-firms, and farms specialized in field crops, while the CAP effect on other type of farms is insignificant or neutral (Figure 11). Therefore, public 37assistance further enlarges \u201ctransitional\u201d disparities between different farms, sub-sectors, eco-systems, and regions. The minor amount of supported farms and agro-ecosystems, deficiency of clear criteria for eco-performance, and the lack of effective control leads to little contribution of new public (CAP) measures to improvement of eco-situation in the country.Figure 11: Impact of CAP on economic, social and environmental sustainability of Bulgarian farms Source: expertise with leading experts, 20124. Efficiency of environmental management in agricultureLand managementA by-product from the new market and private management has been considerable disintensification of agriculture, ease of general eco-pressure and pollution comparing to the pre-reform level.Market adjustment has been associated with a sharp decline in all crop (but sunflower) and livestock (but goat) productions since 1989 23 . Some traditional crop varieties and livestock breeds have been also recovered. A considerable portion of agricultural lands has been left uncultivated for a long period - in some years abandoned land reached one third of the total [MAF]. In recent years, unutilized farmlands are 10% of the total while fallow land accounts for 9% of the arable land. The average yields for major products shrunk to 40-80% of the pre-reform level. The number of livestock has also decreased significantly \u2013 51% for cattle, 53% for poultry, 80 % for pigs, and 81% for sheep [MAF]. Consequently, the Aggregate Livestock Index24 in the country has been one of the smallest in Europe - 0.4 in recent years [EEA, 2010].                                                            23 For potatoes by 33%, wheat 50%, corn and burley 60%, tomatoes, Alfalfa hay and table grape 75%, apples 94%, pig meat 82%, cattle meat 77%, sheep and goat meat 72%, poultry meat 51%, cow milk 45%, sheep milk 66%, buffalo milk 59%, wool 85%, eggs 45%, and honey 57% [NSI].24 the number of livestock units (equines, cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, poultry and rabbits) per UAA.0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100%UnregisteredCooperativesFirmsSpecialized in field cropsSpecialized in vegetablesSpecialized in permanent cropsSpecialized in grazing livestockSpecialized in pigs, pultries and rabitsSpecialized in mix cropsSpecialized in mix livestockIn mix crop-livestockSmall sizeMidgle sizeBig sizeNegativeNeutralInsignificantGoodSignificant38Tractors and combines employed in agriculture have diminished by 64%, and now 5.6% of farms own tractors and 0.7% harvesters while 30-40% hire or use them in association [MAF]. All these have relaxed the overall agricultural pressure on the environment.The amount of fertilizers and pesticides used in agriculture has declined considerably, and now their per ha application is 22% and 31% of the 1989 level (Figure 12). In recent years N, P and K fertilizers are applied for 37.4%, 3.4% and 1.9% of UAA [MAF]. A sharp reduction in chemical use has diminished drastically the risk of chemical contamination of soils, waters, and farm produce. A good part of farm production has got (semi) \u201corganic\u201d character obtaining a good reputation for high quality and safety locally and internationally.Figure 12: Irrigation and chemical application in Bulgarian agriculture  Source: National Statistical Institute  However, a negative rate of fertilizer compensation of N, P, K intakes dominate and average of 23595,4t N, 61033,3t P205 and 184392t K20 have been irreversibly removed annually from soils since 1990 [EEA, 2010]. Unbalance of nutrient components has been typical with application of 5.3 times less P and 6.7 times less K with the appropriate N rate. What is more, monoculture or simple rotation has been constantly practiced by large operators concentrating on few profitable crops (sunflower, cereals etc.). All these practices further contributed to deterioration of soil quality and soil organic matter content.There has been considerable increase in farmland affected by acidification (Figure 13). That is a result of the long-term application of specific nitrate fertilizers and unbalanced fertilizer application without adequate input of phosphorus and potassium The share of acidified soil decreased after 1994, but in recent years there is a reverse tendency along with the augmentation of N use. As much as 4.5% of acidified farmlands are with level harmful for crops. 010020030040050060070080001002003004005006001989 1992 1997 2000 2003 2006 2009Irrigated area (000 ha) Pesticides (00 t)Fertilizers (000 t)Figure 13: Share of degradated agricultural lands in Bulgaria (percent)   Source: Executive Environment Agency  Fraction of salinized land doubled after 1989 but it is merely 1.1% of the to[EEA, 2010]. Widespread application of primitive irrigation techniques, and inappropriate crop choice, rotation and agro-techniques augment inefficiency of water use and localerosion. Since 1990 no effective measures are taken to normalize soil acidity and salinity.Pollution of soil and water from industrial activities, waste management, and improper farming activities is also a serious environment and health risk. Illegareas have noticeably increased reaching an official figure of 4000 with a real number fbigger than reported amount \u201cproduction\u201d with organic and industrial materials pollution of air, water, soils, and disturbing population comfort (noise, odor, dirty roads etc.). Nevertheless, data for the last years show that soils in the country are in good ecological state both in terms of organic content and contamination with heavy metals and metalloids. Polluted with heavy metals and pesticides soils represe2010].Erosion has been a major factor contributinprogressing level is a result of extreme weather but it has been also adversely affected by the dominant agro-techniques, deficiency of antiand recultivation of permanent grasslands. Due to ineffective management 34% of arlands are subjected to wind erosion and 64% to water erosion erosion affects 25-65% of farmland and losses varied from 0.2 to 40 t/ha in different years. Annual losses of earth masses from water erosion are estimated at 145Mt comes from the arable land. Soil losses from water erosion depend on cultivation practices and range from 8 t/y for permanent crops to 48 t/y for arable lands. Losses from wind erosion are around 30 t/y and depend on deforestation, uncorotation, plowing pastures etc.Soil compression affects (mostly) agricultural lands due to untimely transportation and inappropriate agro-techniques (e.g. using heavy machineries when soil moisture is high). It is considered as a threat for soils but no data are available for the extent in agricultural lands.0 10 20198519941999200539al garbage yards in rural [EEA, 2010].

Its able -third of it 40Water managementRestructuring of farms and production has been accompanied with a sharp reduction in irrigated farmland and a considerable distortion of irrigation facilities (Figure 12). There has been more than 21 folds decline in water used in agriculture comparing to 1989 (Table 7). In recent years, sector \u201cAgriculture, hunting, forestry and fishery\u201d comprises merely 3.2% of the total water use, and 0.3% of generated waste waters [NSI]. All these contribute to a considerable reduction of water stress in the country - since 1990 the Water Exploitation Index declined considerably from 55% (the second in Europe) to 33% [EEA, 2010].Table 7.

What is more, a considerable physical distortion of irrigation facilities has taken place affecting most part of the internal canals. As a result the area equipped for irrigation in agriculture substantially decreased. Furthermore, primitive irrigation techniques have been widespread and augmented inefficiency of water use and local soil erosion. Water losses in the irrigation system amount 70% as consequence of the poorly maintained facilities, low efficiency, and water stealing [Alexandrov]. Nevertheless, the overall negative irrigation impact of irrigation on erosion and salinization has been diminished considerably after 1990 [EEA, 2010].The decline in irrigation has also had a direct harmful effect on crop yields and structure of rotation [Bachev, 2010b]. The level of irrigation depends on the humidity in each year, kind of irrigated crops and water prices. Irrigation has not been effectively used to correct inappropriate seasonal and regional distribution of rainfalls, and mitigate effect of                                                             25 Irrigation water accounts for the major share in total agricultural water use \u2013 74.2% [NSI].41climate change26 on farming and land degradation. Farms little capability for adaptation has resulted in huge crop, livestock and property losses during recent droughts and floods.There has been a considerable amelioration of the quality of surface and ground waters as a result of unintended decrease of negative impact of agriculture and the sharp decline in chemical fertilizers and pesticides application. This trend has diminished drastically the pressure on environment and the risk of chemical contamination of soils and waters.Nitrate and phosphate content in surface water decreased throughout transition and slightly increase in the last 3 years [EEA, 2010]. Currently only 0.7% of samples exceeds the Ecological Limit Value (ELV) for nitrate. Despite improvement, many water eco-systems are at risk cased by the agricultural emissions in water and increasing application of chemicals. In drinking water around 5% of analyses show deviation of nitrates up to 5 times above the appropriate level [EEA, 2010]. The later is mostly restricted to 400 small residential locations but it is also typical for almost 9% of the big water collection zones. Improper use of nitrate fertilizers, inappropriate crop and livestock practices, and non-compliance with the specific rules for farming in water supply zones, are all responsible for that problem.Around a quarter of riverlength does not meet the standards for water quality [MAF]. Monitoring of water for irrigation shows that in 45% of samples, the nitrates concentration exceeds contamination limit 2-20 folds [EEA, 2010]. Nitrates are also the most common polluter of ground waters with slight excess over the ecological limit [EEA, 2010]. A moderate concentration of N (bellow 25 mg per liter) in different levels of underground waters dominates with increasing trends in shallow waters and downward trends in others. Besides, around country a tendency for reduction in pesticides concentration in underground water is reported with occasional cases of Triasines over the ELV after 2000. There is further improvement since 2007 and the concentration of pesticides in all samples has been bellow the water quality standards. Nitrate Vulnerable Zones cover 53% of country\u2019s territory and 68% of UAA [MAF].The lack of effective manure storage capacity and sewer systems in majority of farms, challenge posed by inadequate storage and disposal of expired and prohibited pesticides, and illegal garbage dumps in rural areas, all contributes significantly to the persistence of the problem. Most part of the post-communist livestock activity is carried out by a great number of small and primitive holdings often located within residential borders. Moreover, only 0.1% of the livestock farms possess safe manure-pile sites, around 81% of them use primitive dunghills, and 116 thousands holdings have no facilities at all [MAF]. Besides, decreasing amount of manure has been used for fertilization of merely 0.2% of utilized farmlands in recent years.                                                            26 Eighteen of the past 21 years are with positive anomalies in average temperatures and there is a trend for increasing soils\u2019 water deficiency [EEA, 2010]. According to climate forecasts temperature will continue to increase, rains quantity to decrease, more extreme events (thunderstorms, floods, droughts, hurricane winds) to occur, and water stress experienced around the country. 42Serious eco-challenge has been posed by inadequate storage and disposal of expired and prohibited pesticides which amount has augmented since 2001[EEA, 2010]. A good portion of country\u2019s polluted localities (28%) is associated with these dangerous chemicals. Despite progression in management (modernization of storehouses, safe capsulation, exporting for deactivation) in the past years there are still 298 abandoned storehouses (57% of all) in 292 locations containing 1956t old pesticides (15.3% of the total amount). In the last several years a stable amount of nullified sediments from industrial and residential waters have been utilized in agriculture and for recultivation of degradated lands. In 2010 the applied sediments in agriculture and for recultivation of degradated lands (13644t dry content) increased up to 49% share of the totally utilized sediments in the country [EEA, 2010].Biodiversity managementSince 1990 the amount of protected areas in the country almost doubled [NSI]. Specially introduced rules for agricultural practices in NATURA territories and CAP eco-and other measures additionally created conditions for improvement of biodiversity management. Furthermore, market and private initiatives led to recovering of some traditional (and more sustainable) livestock breeds and plants varieties as well as introducing new crops and livestock (novel food, industrial and energy crops; exotic animals like ostrich etc.) increasing agricultural biodiversity.Nevertheless, the widespread lack of proper eco-management has affected negatively biodiversity in some agro- and related ecosystems. For instance, the intensive cereal and industrial crop enterprises have paid little attention to biodiversity protection in enormous fields of operations. On the other hand, considerable portion of farmlands have been left uncultivated for a long time or entirely abandoned, and some agro-ecosystems lost their \u201cagro\u201d character turning into natural ecosystems. That has caused uncontrolled \u201cdevelopment\u201d of species allowing development of some of them and suppressing others. Some of the most valuable ecosystems (natural grassland) have been also severely damaged27. Part of the meadows has been left under-grazed or under mowed, and intrusion of shrubs and trees took places. Some fertile semi-natural grasslands have been converted to cultivation of crops, vineyards, or orchards. This has resulted in irreversible disappearance of plant species diversity. In addition, certain municipal and state pastures (with official and/or practical \u201ccommon access\u201d status) have been degraded by unsustainable use (over-grazing) by private and domestic animals. Besides, a reckless collection of valuable wild plants (berries, herbs, flowers) and animals (snail, snakes, fish) have led to destruction of all natural habitats.                                                            27 20% of agricultural lands in Bulgaria are lands of High Nature Value [MAF].43The Index of Birds in Agricultural Lands in the country is negative and for the last 5 years the variety of bird species under monitoring living in agricultural lands has decreased by 10% [EEA, 2010]. The birds in agricultural territories are with the largest amount of diminishing number (including moderate and strong tends) but there are no studies on factors for these trends.During the last decades there has been significant degrading impacts of agriculture on biodiversity as all 37 typical animal breeds have been endangered, among them 6 are irreversibly extinct, 12 are almost extinct, 16 are endangered, and 3 are potentially endangered [MEW].Air and green-house gas managementAgriculture practices contribute to dust and odor contamination of air in some areas. Particularly disturbing are the small-scale and domestic livestock operations often located within residential territories (villages, town) and increasing local odor and noise pollution. Agriculture is also responsible for considerable emissions of certain harmful substances in the air. It releases approximately 75% of Ammonia (NH3) and 11% of Non-methane organic compounds (NMVOC) in the country (Figure 14). The biggest sources of NH3 are cattle (dairy cows and buffalo cows) and for NMVOC - one-year crops with fertilization [EEA, 2011]. Agricultural contribution to Nitrogen oxides (NOx) and Carbon monoxide (CO) is insignificant \u2013 2.3% and 0.4% accordingly.Figure 14: Harmful emissions in air from Bulgarian agriculture (2009)Source: Executive Environment Agency  There has been enormous reduction of overall green-house gas (GHG) emissions from agriculture28 since 1988 (Figure 15). Moreover, the decline in the sector's contribution has been higher than the national. That has come as \u201cunintentional\u201d outcome of the post-communist restructuring of the sector and the new models of farm management.                                                             28 GHGs from Agriculture\u201d result from production and processing of agricultural products, soil fertilization, animal manure processing and preservation. Emissions from combustion processes for energy production and from agricultural machines are not reported but they are insignificant amount.01020304050607080Nox NMVOC NH3 COAgriculture (000 t/y)Share in national (%)44Figure 15: Trends in green-house gas emissions from Bulgarian agricultureSource: EEA, 2011During 2000-2004 there was a period of an increase and since then a stable trend for diminishing agricultural GHG emissions. The sector is the second biggest emitter of GHGs contributing between 7-10% of the total amount during the last decade. The main factors of agricultural GHGs have been agricultural soils (56%), enteric fermentation (22%), and manure management (19%) [EEA, 2011].Agriculture mostly produces N2O and CH4 emissions. In the last decade the majority of N2O emissions comes from agricultural soils, manure management, and fields burning. The methane emission is 36% of the agricultural GHGs and the biggest portion comes from enteric fermentation from domestic livestock and manure management. Reduction of livestock number is responsible for considerable decrease in agricultural CH4 emission in past years. On the other hand, there is a six-fold increase of CH4 from rice cultivation since 1999 as a result of the partial recovery of this sub-sector. Illegal field burning of residues and crops also emits GHGs-precursors which are not significant but they doubled since the period before 1990.5. Impacts of EU CAP implementation of farms natural resources management and strategiesCAP effect on environmental sustainability of farmsAccording to more than a half of the farm managers 29 the overall impact from implementation of different mechanisms and instruments of EU CAP (common market, new standards and regulations, direct payments, NPARD measures etc.) on their environmental sustainability is good (Figure 16). The favorable effect of CAP on eco-sustainability is felt                                                             29 Survey was carrid in the end of 2012 with the managers of 84 commercial farms.

Nevertheless, for all farms specialized in mix livestock, those located in protected zones and territories, and for majority of firms with permanent crops, plan regions and big size, the impact from implementation of CAP instruments on environmental sustainability of farms is insignificant or neutral.More than third of farms, receiving agri-environmental payments (Measure 123) report, that effect of that support on their farm in good (Figure 17). Also a good portion of farms with payments for mountainous areas with handicaps (Measure 121) and in areas with handicaps different from mountainous (Measure 122) assess as good (accordingly 15,4% and 8,3%) and significant (accordingly 7,7% and 8,3%) the effect on these measure on their holdings.Nearly a quarter of the managers of farms supported by \u201ePayments to farmers in mountainous areas with handicaps\u201d (Measure 211) assess as good or significant the effect of this public instrument on their farm.

The impact of this public instrument on all other farms is either insignificant or neutral (including for all Sole Traders, and farms specialized in livestock, and holdings in protected zones and territories).Dynamics of farms indicators comparing to period before CAP implementationThe greatest share of surveyed farms indicates an increased level of a part of the main indicators in the present time comparing to the levels in the period before EU CAP implementation (Figure 18). For instance, higher or considerable higher is the level of the total income, costs, investments, profit, labor productivity, efficiency of the production and management in the majority of farms. Also the biggest portion of holdings has an improved access to public support, and augmented amount of subsidies for production, income and investment support. At the same time, the share of farms with lower total indebtedness comparing to the pre-accession period is 38%, while with a higher one bellow 18%. 0204060\u041c.111\u041c.112\u041c.121\u041c.122\u041c.123\u041c.141\u041c.142\u041c.211\u041c.212\u041c.214\u041c.223\u041c.226\u041c.311\u041c.312\u041c.313\u041c.321\u041c.322\u041c.411-13/431SignificantGood47Figure 18: Levels of farms indicators comparing to level before CAP implementation in BulgariaSource: interviews with farm managersAccording to the more than a half of farms they have an improved qualification and information, agro-techniques and crop rotation, and livestock conditions, as well as increased product and food safety, and innovation activity comparing to the period before CAP implementation.

Besides, more than a third of farms have no improvement in the relations with state organizations and in the access to public support in comparison to the pre-accession period.Therefore, implementation of diverse instruments of CAP does not lead to a progressive change in the man indicators of a good part of farms. The later is either due to the lack of positive effect from CAP on a portion of holdings (for example, lack of effective public support) or due to neutralized effect of CAP on other negative factors which could have deteriorated even further the state of farms (in conditions of lack of counterbalancing the existing negative trends CAP instruments).For a considerable share of farms the current levels of the main indicators is lower or significantly lower comparing to the level before CAP introduction. For instance, 27% of surveyed holdings indicate deteriorated financial independence, more than 24% are with diminished profit, almost 17% are with reduced net income and competitiveness, around 16% are with inferior economic sustainability, almost 15% are with lower profitability, and 14% are with deteriorated social sustainability. Similarly, nearly 19% of farms are with worsened relations with the state organizations, above 13% of them have decreased efficiency of contractual relations, every tenth is with inferior livestock conditions, almost 9% of holdings are with decreased access to public support, and more than 8% are with reduced membership in professional organizations.All these show that CAP implementation is associated with deterioration of main indicators of a considerable portion of farms. This is either because of the negative effects of CAP on a party of farms, or due to the lack of effective mechanisms for assisting the farms adaptation and for compensating the influence of other negative factors (e.g. competition with heavily subsidized imported products at the national and international markets, high interest rates of bank credits, big market price fluctuations etc.). Therefore, CAP implementation does not contribute to improvement of naturalresources conservation capability and efficiency in a great portion of farms in the country.That necessitates improvement of the CAP implementation through perfection of management public programs, change in design and/or beneficiaries of some CAP instruments, or requiresrethinking and reforming individual mechanisms or the policy as a whole.6. Conclusion and policy recommendationsOur analysis has demonstrated that suggested new framework let better understand, assess and improve natural resources conservation management and strategies in the specific 49market, institutional and natural environment of individual farms, ecosystems, regions, sub-sectors and countries.We have showed that post-communist transition and EU integration has brought about significant changes in environmental management in Bulgarian agriculture. Newly evolved market, private and public governance has led to a significant improvement of eco-management and eco-impacts of agriculture introducing modern eco-standards and public support, enhancing environmental stewardship, disintensifying production, recovering landscape and traditional productions, and diversifying quality, eco-products and services. Agrarian transition and integration has been also associated with some new challenges such as unsustainable exploitation of natural resources, lost biodiversity, land degradation, water and air contamination etc.Furthermore, implementation of the \u201ccommon\u201d EU policies has been having unlike results in the specific \u201cBulgarian\u201d conditions. Up to date (and likely in a short and medium term) it enlarges income, technological, and eco-discrepancy between different farms, sub-sectors, and regions. In a longer-term eco-hazard(s) caused by agriculture will likely expand unless effective public and private measures are taken to mitigate existing eco-problems and risks. Moreover, the specific structures for management of farming activity (small commercial, semi-market, and subsistence farms, production cooperatives, large business firms) will continue to dominate in years to come and have to incorporate the eco-management needs.Therefore, a significant improvement of public (Government, EU) interventions in agrarian and eco-management is needed to enhance sustainability of prospective farms and sustainable agrarian and rural development. Implementation of the EU common (agricultural, environmental, regional etc.) policies would have no desired impacts on environmental conservation and improvement unless special measures are taken to improve eco-information and assessments; modernize the system of property rights, public regulations and enforcement; perfect management of public organizations, programs and services; and extend public support to and partnerships with dominating farming (including small-scale and subsistence) structures etc.Our analysis has identified that the major problems, challenges and risks in eco-management of Bulgarian agriculture at the current state of development are:- inadequate and/or badly coordinated and funded management strategies for natural resources conservation;- lack of appropriate information and assessments on eco-pressures, states, impacts and risks available for all farmers and other agents related with natural environment;- ineffective system of formal property rights (rules) and public enforcement of laws, contracts and official standards;- farmland degradation (exhaustion, erosion, contamination, compression);- ineffective water utilization and waters contamination;- air pollution;50- adverse effect on natural biodiversity;- poor waste management (burning fields, illegal garbage dumping and yards, ineffective storing and disposal of old chemicals);- not-motivated, incapable and/or unsustainable farming structures;- lack of effective eco-organizations able to mitigate existing and emerging eco-conflicts and risks; - lack of sufficient eco-education in farmers and other stakeholders;- lack of effective system of eco-innovations;- ineffective forms of public involvement \u2013 inadequate, under or over-intervention; gaps in planning, coordination and regulations; high controversy, unpredictability and costs; insufficient capability and funding; large-scale mismanagement; lack of participation of and partnership with other stakeholders etc.Therefore, further improvement of institutional environment, public policies and modes of public intervention is necessary to modernize the system of eco-management in agriculture. More particularly public policies and strategies are to be directed to:First, better integration of environmental (including neglected eco-system services, ground water etc.) policy in agrarian and development policies as effective design and enforcement of long-term eco-measures get a high priority. Up to date most public efforts have been put on addressing urgent socio-economic (e.g. financial) problems while improvement of eco-management is perceived as unimportant. Accordingly, no measures are taken to mitigate or prevent various eco-risks (e.g. impacts of climate change, constant practicing of monoculture, re-intensification etc.). Furthermore, it is to be stability and certainty in eco-policy (long-term public commitment rather than frequent changes) in order to induce effective private and collective actions. For instance, a major reason for low investments in otherwise efficient agricultural green energy (energy crops; manure, biomass and wind energy production) has been the big uncertainty about the long-term policy in the area.  Second, complete application of integral approach of soil, water and biodiversity management in planning, funding, management, monitoring, controlling and assessment at all levels with stakeholders\u2019 involvement in decision-making. Moreover, eco-system services, life-cycle, eco-, energy and water accounts and footprints, and other modern approaches are to be incorporated into program design and management at all levels.Third, improving coordination and efficiency of actions of various public and private agents involved in eco-management. Individual elements and responsibilities in public eco-management are usually divided between various agents and organizations with poor coordination, conflicting interests, and inconsistency, controversies, gaps and inefficiency of actions.Forth, better defining, regulating and further privatizing (collectivizing) property, user, management, trading, discharge etc. rights and assets related to eco-resources, eco-system services, renewable energy supply, (N, GHG) emissions, waste discharges etc. 51Five, employing a greater range of economic instruments including appropriate pricing, quotas, public funding and insurance, taxing, interlinking etc. to improve eco-resources use efficiency and risk-sharing, prevent over-intensification and pressure on natural resources, and support farms adaptation to changing market, institutional and natural environment.Six, organizationally and financially securing adequate eco-data collection, monitoring, and independent assessment, including agricultural linkages with the state of environment: soil, water and air contamination; impacts on biodiversity; waste production and decomposition; total social costs, energy intensity, eco- (water) foot-print, benefits from farming; effect on eco-conservation and improvement; renewable energy production; impacts of climate change; existing and likely risks etc. What is more, adequate mechanisms to assure timely disclosure and effective communication of available information to decision-makers, stakeholders and public at large are to be put in place.Seven, better adapting EU CAP and national instruments to the specific Bulgarian conditions through greater support to farm modernization and adaptation, eco-innovations, and prospective business and non-for profit modes; relaxing the EU criteria for semi-market and young farmers; directing funds to prospective (Farm modernization and adaptation, Young farmers, environmental), and unsupported (Organic livestock, restoration of abandoned farmland) measures and organizations (livestock, public academic centers); and better implementing planed eco- measures.Nine, improving eco-education and training of farmers, administrators, other stakeholders and public at large through modernization of agrarian education and Agricultural Education and Advisory Service. The later are to reach all agents via effective methods of education, advice, and information (TV, radio, on line information; demonstration) suited to their specific needs; set up a system of continues training and sharing experiences; include eco-, water, waste management, climate change and rural development issues; cooperate with other (public and private) academic institutions and private organizations; involve farmers and stakeholders in programs management, implementation and assessment at all levels.Eight, employing more hybrid (public-private, public-collective) modes given their coordination, incentives, and control advantages. Public organization and enforcement of most eco-standards is very difficult (especially in huge informal sectors and remote areas). Public support to voluntary initiatives of professional, community and non-governmental organizations (informing, training, assisting, funding, risk-sharing), and assistance in cooperation at grass-root, eco-system, watershed, trans-regional, trans-border levels is much more efficient. Accordingly, real participation of farmers and stakeholders in priority setting, management, and assessment of public programs and regulations at all levels is to be institutionalized.Ten, improving the overall institutional environment and public governance perfecting property rights protection, laws and contracts enforcement, combating against mismanagement and corruption in public sector, removing restrictions for market, private and collective initiatives etc.52Eleven, giving more public support to multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary research on all aspects and impacts of eco-management, including factors and forms of eco-management, and their impact on individual and collective eco-behavior and environmentalpreservation. Up to date efforts of Ecologists, Technologists, Economists, Law, Sociologists, Behavioral and Political Scientists have been rarely united; most studies focus on individual aspect(s) of sustainability, or certain form(s) of management, or management level, or geographical location. What is more, the governance of farming is usually separated from the management of households and rural activities; and \u201cnormative\u201d (to some \u201cideal\u201d or \u201cmodel in a foreign country\u201d) rather than comparative (between feasible alternatives) approach is broadly employed; and significant social (third-party, recovery, transaction etc.) costs largely ignored. Consequently, institutional, behavioral, economic, ecological, international etc. factors of environmental sustainability are not properly understood, spectrum of feasible management modes properly identified, and efficiency, complementarities, and prospects of development adequately assessed.

However industrial and eco-nomic growth are needed whether a sceptic or, advocate of climate change. On theother hand whether a sceptic or, advocate of climate change, industrial and economic growthare both needed today. Not so much for ourselves here in the Western world. that the rapidlygrowing other half of the world population is entitled to their share of wealth and happiness(Venselaar 2003). The recent World Bank,World Development Report 2010: Developmentand Climate Change outlines significant damage to developing countries from climate change,with up to 80 per cent of all costs associated with global warming borne by poorer countries.Similarly at the close of the 40th Pacific Islands Forum in Cairns. The Australian primeminister Mr. Kevin Rudd said dealing with climate change is more than just a matter of ur-gency for many Pacific island nations, it is an issue of national survival. It was (MontgomeryThe International Journal of Climate Change: Impacts and ResponsesVolume 1, Number 4, 2009, http://www.Climate-Journal.com, ISSN 1835-7156\u00a9 Common Ground, Abdallah M. Hasna, All Rights Reserved, Permissions:cg-support@commongroundpublishing.com2007) that described in his book Dirt: The Erosion of Civilizations, how soil erosion led fallof civilisations fromMesopotamia to Rome, hence from poor irrigation common engineeringtasks lead to the fall of ancient civilisations? The significance of engineering technologiesrole in the climate change debate is colossal, sustainability cannot be addressed separatelyto engineering efficiency. Who would suspect that a chemical compound as common andseemingly innocuous as carbon dioxide would generate such gales of contention? this exampleof engineering technology is Carbon Dioxide CO2 being one of the main contributors in thehuman induced global warming, that is accelerated by the burning of fossil fuels and defor-estation, i.e. the more we burn the more greenhouse gases are produced. Hence as a systemnatural variation for the planet is incapable to recover from its own loses. The above men-tioned challenges define the concept of sustainability. Which is generally acknowledged asthe results of a balance among the three aspects of sustainable development: economic, en-vironmental, and societal (Martins et al. 2007). This paper is divided into two sections. Thefirst gives a brief overview of the contextual background sustainability discussion in engin-eering, the second discuses the linkages between technology, engineering and climate change.1.0 Engineering and TechnologyIn the words of Goldman (1991), engineering, as an element of technology as a social process,is actually changing the world. Technology is the process by which humans modify natureto meet their needs and wants (NAE 2007). Engineering has been central to the great eco-nomic growth that has characterised the rise of industrial capitalism and as we move into aknowledge-based economy it remains a fundamental element (Institution of EngineersAustralia 1997). Engineers are applications people, typically engineers apply science tocreate solutions. Engineers, are creators of technology (Christ 2002), through the applicationof scientific principles design and construction essentially defines engineering. Similarly\u201ctechnology\u201d is has strong links to economics and growth models. The importance of theengineering sciences and technology in driving sustainable economic and social developmentand addressing basic needs and the reduction of poverty was emphasised at the World Con-ference on Science in 1999, the World Engineers\u2019 Convention in 2000, the JohannesburgWorld Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002, WEC 2004 titled Engineers Shape theSustainable Future and relate particularly to the UNMillenniumDevelopment Goals. FinallyTechnologies \u2018evolve\u2019 to solve the problems as perceived by various relevant social groupshence contemporary society, Science and technology are inseparable. This validate by theSocial Construction of Technology (SCOT) Studies, (Berger and Luckmann 1967;MacKenzieandWajcman 1985; Beniger 1986; Bijker et al. 1987; MacKenzie andWajcman 1999; Kleinand Kleinman 2002; Webster 2002; Dafoe 2005).2.0 Society and TechnologySociety is becoming even more dependent on engineering and technology (Chisholm 2003).Technology is essential to the human condition. Our human species is now totally dependentupon it. Without technology, we would not be able to sustain the present human populationon this planet. Moreover, without technology, the human population could never even havegrown to anything near its current level. Therefore Technology is intertwined with society\u2019sprogress, similarly the critique of technology root of sustainability originated in 1960\u2019s and140THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE: IMPACTS ANDRESPONSES1970\u2019s (Bell and Morse 1999) this theory was advanced by (Schumacher 1973) howeverKidd (1992) suggested the roots of sustainability in a broad sense has originated from sixseparate strains but we do not intend to describe each of these, except for technology. Thereason is that information technology lies at the root of productivity and economic growth(Sterne 2000). Economic developments in the first decade of the 21st century emphasize theessence of information technology and digital society in the expansion of knowledge(Lowenstein 2004; Lowenstein 2005; Hasna 2009). However a digital society implies de-pendence on networked ICT\u2019s, with more people using the internet, cell phones, digitalvideo, digital music, and PC\u2019s etc.. Therefore a digital society implies reliance on electricityin supporting 21st century socioeconomic development (Baer et al. 2002). But electricity asby tradition poses reliance on finite natural resources. Engineers have long benefited froma seemingly limitless supply of natural resources from which to draw, including sources andsinks for society\u2019s wastes(Ouda,2008).Figure 1: Waves of Innovation (Hargroves and Smith 2005)3.0 Engineers and TechnologyWhat is exactly an engineer? from the Renaissance on, engineers have often insisted on thenecessity to ground their practice on science (Picon,2004). Engineering formalized knowledgerelates to engineering practice and science. this science is formalized by relations of math-ematics, mechanics, physics and chemistry. Technology is essential to the human condition.Our human species is now totally dependent upon it. Without technology, we would not beable to sustain the present human population on this planet (Merkel 2000). With impendingand burgeoning societal issues affecting both developed and emerging nations such as India141ABDALLAH M. HASNAand China, the global engineering community has a responsibility and an opportunity totruly make a difference and contribute (Mishra, 2009).The fundamental role of engineers and technology in the economic and politic arena hasdirect relationship with the perception of our natural resources, for instance the world largesteconomy the United States, has deliberated on the issues through the white house as follows,Science helps us to understand the origins, characteristics and consequences of globalproblems. Finding solutions to these problems, and elucidating the complex chains of causeand effect through which they may be linked, requires a coordinated effort by natural andsocial scientists, engineers, and policy-makers. During the so-called modern era of the last400 years, Western civilisation has flourished in virtually all areas. The Renaissance usheredin an era of philosophical, institutional, social, technological, and economic developmentunparalleled in human history (Hector, 2008). Today science remains to play an increasingrole in the expansion of contemporary Society. Engineers must remain true to the fundamentalprinciples of objectivity and impartiality. Since transforming scientific breakthroughs intonew technologies can have a profound impact on the ecosystem, but wise stewardship ofthese technologies is essential to the well-being of the greater humanity. The economic de-velopment experienced by the developed nations in the past 50 years raises interestingquestions whether the so called \u201cwestern system\u201d is sustainable in the long-term, particularlyas industrialisation extends to the emerging economies or the other rest of the world popula-tion. One challenge for engineers in sustainability is to use technology in a harmony to ad-vance productivity with long-term viability. For example, technology helped bring aboutthe Green Revolution, which resulted in increased agricultural productivity worldwide (WhiteHouse 1995). But at the same time, poorly designed irrigation systems led to soil degradationin some areas. In the decades ahead, technology will be called upon to feed a growing worldpopulation, with minimum impact on the integrity of soil, water, forests, and other resources(Wasserman-Goodman 1996).Sustainability assessment tools are one of the ways availableto engineers to relate to the needs and aspirations of the broader community in providing asustainable future for humanity.3.2 Critique of Sustainability Measurement ToolsWhat direction should the engineering profession be driving towards? A number of methodswere presented in literature, primarily through Educating engineers on over consumption,this was suggested by Swearengena and Woodhouseb, (2003), furthermore A central issuefor engineers in the context of sustainable practices in engineering would be the plethora ofdefinitions and measurement tools of the concept of sustainability. A review of currentpractices had been conducted by (Hasna, 2009). A number of notable works had critiquedthe limitations of these tools. Sustainability assessments should be objectives-led, ratherthan merely being a baseline assessment.Hurley et al.,(2008) Articulated limitations of tools use to include the following1. Lack of available data on the day prevented proper consideration of options; even usingassumed data, the process is too time consuming to fit into ordinary work schedules.2. Public engagement (for evaluation of social criteria) is difficult without incentives,funding and training.142THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE: IMPACTS ANDRESPONSES3. Criteria weighting is subjective and depends on the spatial and temporal scale of theproblem.4. Criteria definitions are seen by some to be vague and overlapping.5. Criteria evaluations focus on negative rather than positive aspects of different watermanagement options.6. Some criteria are actually vetoes, with boundaries having been previously set at policylevel.7. Decisions are made based on what users think should denote importance, not what theythink actually does.8. The overtly quantitativeJha andMurthy (2006) found serious problems in respect to ESI methodology. These involve(i) intercorrelation amongst variables \u2013 cause and effect; (ii) use of equal weights \u2013 ignoringPCA (for a brief overview of PCA see Chapter 4); (iii) ignoring outliers \u2013 truncation; (iv)correlation with other variables; (v) ambiguity of the index (changing the sign); and (vi)relevance index (implicit weights). We now briefly discuss these problems.According to (Pediaditi et al., 2006) most tools that do exist focus on building performanceand environmental issues either during construction or in the future land use and thus fail toconsider the site holistically across its lifecycle and to evaluate the wider implications andsocio-economic effects of a development. In addition there are no tools capable of assessingthe sustainability of a redevelopment project throughout its life-cycle (meaning from itsconception and design to construction and its operation) (Pediaditi et al., 2005).Smythe and Isber (2003) found need for additional guidance and training in the analysisof cumulative and indirect effects and for more specific guidance on the appropriate levelof analysis reviewed the implementation of The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)in the USA which required federal agencies to integrate environmental values into their de-cision making processes by considering the environmental impacts of their proposed actionsand reasonable alternatives to those actions.4.0 Challenges for Engineers: Adapting to the Inevitable?With so many voices weighing in on climate change debate, the emerging questions centreon what climate change really means to engineers? (Mastromatteo 2009) Engineering is akey discipline for the resolution of many of the problems of sustainability and it is arguedhere that to identify some principles of 21st-century sustainable engineering practice is ofgreat importance(Hector, 2008). Engineers as the problem solvers provide for scarcity ofresorces needed for human survival, i.e energy assurance, acute water challenges, food pro-duction, housing, sanitation and waste management, energy efficiencies, decarbonization,engineers are being invited to strut their hour on the global warming stage. Engineers havemuch to contribute, all decisions making, solutions and innovation needs to include engineersneeds to include an engineering perspective, given that engineers are themakers of technologyand technology is directly related to climate change.Let us examine the engineers role and professional existence in society, we live in a worldcaptured; uprooted and transformed by the titanic economic and techno-scientific process(Hobsbawm 1994). According to picon (2004) Engineering has a relatively specific type ofambition, an ambition extending far beyond the simple desire to gain or maintain one\u2019s social143ABDALLAH M. HASNAstatus and power. This ambition might account for the recurring links between engineeringconceptions and utopia from the Renaissance to the present. Strangely enough, the figure ofthe engineer has been often associated with utopian dreams, from the fantastic machines of16th- and 17th-century utopian narratives to the technocratic streak of many 20th-centuryfictions. From the 19th century on, engineers have been furthermore associated to manyutopian movements. Emerging economies the like of china, India and Brazil are redefiningthe climate change argument. Hence with this in mind OECD Engineers are well poised todeal with the challenges of climate change and emission trading schemes. Similarly Engineersin developing nations need to be conscious as not make or repeat of the same mistakes bornby outbursts of industrialization to their OECD counterpart. In a global historical context,(Cohen 1995) suggested four periods of evolution in human population growth, the first relatedto development of local agriculture (8000 BC), the second related to global agriculture (AD1750), the third related to public health (1950) and the fourth related to fertility (1970). Butit is information technology that defines this special period. But according to (Crump 2001;DeGregori 2003; King 2005; Restivo 2005; Kehl 2008) whether the focus is technology, theeconomy, or society at large, it is widely accepted that technology will have profound effectson natural resources. According to (Hargroves and Smith 2005) technology develops as aresponse to a perceived problem, need, or desire, the waves shown in Figure 1 illustrate theprogression of technology along with the time, simultaneously with the maturing civil society.Development is often described in terms of the successive advances in technology. For ex-ample, the steam age, the industrial age, and the information technology age all refer to dif-ferent historical periods. We now live in a world that is highly reliant upon technology forfood, employment and economic prosperity. Very often several solutions are available toaddress a given situation. Being able to select the most appropriate technology initially canreduce the potentially disastrous social, economic and environmental impacts that an inap-propriate choice may have in the longer term.Figure 2: Components of a Technological System Source (Hay and Noonan 2002)The major sources of environmental pressures normally associated with the different com-ponents of a technology are listed in Figure 2 not limited to material, energy, transport, CO2emissions and solid emissions The main pathways by which a technology interacts with itssurroundings can normally be divided into the following categories; the material, labour andenergy resources used by the technology, the wastes and hazardous products released intothe environment, and the impacts of the supporting infrastructure and services. Whilst theenvironmental consequences of a technology will vary with both the characteristics of thepressures, all the components listed in Figure 2 relate directly to climate change, and sustain-ability. Hence, technology operating in different locations may have very different environ-mental impacts relates directly to sustainability. Technologies that improve energy efficiency144THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE: IMPACTS ANDRESPONSESand green energy from renewable sources in all its different forms are a reality, solar power,wind power, wave power, geothermal power and tidal power. The cost of carbon captureand storage must be accounted for in engineering to remain true to sustainability ideals.Therefore it is astounding why technology would not remain a major criterion in sustain-ability assessments. Fuchs and Lorek (2000) identified technology as an important determ-inant of Sustainability. In addition (Van der Wal and Noorman 1998) found that technologyinfluences energy consumption, (D\u00fcrrenberger and Nikola 1999) found that technology isan important source of reduction potentials for energy consumption. Ferguson et al. (1997)examined the relations between total energy consumption and wealth creation and betweenelectricity generation and wealth creation and recommended that the benefits of electricitygeneration are at last of the same order of magnitude as economic development itself. Therelationship between energy consumption and the gross national product (GNP) of countrieshas become such a commonly understood concept that figures in US dollars per tonne of oilequivalent (toe) are quoted as world development indicators by the United Nations (UN)1994. Pacey (1983) tackled the idea that technological design seems to be divorced from thecontext of the use of products. He gives examples of big dams feeding leaking pipes andelectricity generating stations pumping heat into the atmosphere when electricity is mainlyused for heating, as examples of halfway technology. Today most major car companies aretaking steps to lighten their vehicles while improving their quality, to improve the efficiencyof existing types of engine while reducing their unwanted exhaust emissions. This is perhapswhat (Alexander 1964) would describe as forms that badly fit their context; Fitness is therelation of mutual acceptability between domains. In a problem of design we want to satisfymutual demands which the two make on one another. We want to put the context and theform into effortless contact or frictionless coexistence. The importance of technology is re-cognised in the literature. At a macro level, technology has been described as the major engineof economic growth (Dunning 1988). At micro level, technology has given firms the powerto circumvent scarce factors via new products and processes (Porter 1990). According to(Freeman 1974) sociologists like Marcuse and novelist such as Simone de Beauvoir seetechnology as a means of human enslavement and destruction while Adam Smith and KarlMarx see it primarily as a liberating force. This is exceptionally attractive especially becauseit was written in the early part of the industrial revolution. The interaction of the technologywith the environment as described by (Balkema et al. 2002) where the demands of the enduser is translated into functional criteria that must be fulfilled by the technology. In accordancewith (Hasna 2008) we acknowledge the importance of financial criterion observed underTriple bottom line (TBL) to assess for climate change and sustainability assessments (Rapport1997; Wall 1997; Safley 1998; Saida et al. 2006); however on the other hand literature islimited with clarity on the relationship between climate change, sustainability and technology.Hasna (2009) refers to technology as sphere of influence to climate change. All too often,climate change is seen as an adverse effect of technology or technology failure that occurredas a consequence of events that have not been identified and planned for in advance. As wemove away from the age of industrialization to the age of knowledged. We beg to questionwhether climate change was avoidable, i.e. If had the risks of technology were been high-lighted at the start of the age of industrialization would current end result have varied ofclimate change exist today? Hence, sustainability in the age of knowledge is a process whichtells of a development of all aspects of human life affecting sustenance. It means resolvingthe conflict between the various competing goals, and involves the simultaneous pursuit of145ABDALLAH M. HASNAeconomic prosperity, environmental quality and social equity famously known as three di-mensions (triple bottom line) with is the resultant vector being technology, hence it is acontinually evolving process; the \u2018journey\u2019 (the process of achieving sustainability) is ofcourse vitally important, but only as a means of getting to the destination (the desired futurestate). However,the \u2018destination\u2019 of sustainability is not a fixed place in the normal sensethat we understand destination. Instead, it is a set of wishful characteristics of a future system.4.1 Managing CO\u2082 Emissions \u2014 Today Not TomorrowAccording to Molina et al 2009 (1995 Nobel laureate in chemistry) rapid cuts to greenhousegases other than CO2 would slow down dangerous climate change and buy us time to bringdown CO2 emissions.World Development Report 2010, development and Climate Change, says that advancedcountries, which produced most of the greenhouse gas emissions of the past, must act toshape our climate future. As engineers conversing on sustainability, it is important to keepit aligned with the physical laws that govern our universe; to facilitate a comprehensivediscussion a note worthy to mention the two dominating philosophies revolving around what\u201csustainability\u201d really means? Cornucopian theory states that there are few intractable naturallimits to growth and believes the world can provide practically limitless abundance of naturalresources. Opposing to that is the Malthusian school of thought predicts population wouldoutrun food supply and resources, In another context second law of thermodynamics governsthe conversion of energy from one form to another, dU = dW + dQ = dW + TdSWhere dU, the change in the internal energy of a system is equal to the sum of the reversiblework done on it dW and the heat irreversibly exchanged with the environment dQ = TdS(which is associated with a change in the entropy of the system). Hence from the SecondLaw of increasing entropy or unidirectional flow of thermal energy, no machine that is 100%efficient. Consequently if we consider entropy in terms of thermodynamic efficiency, whichis the ratio of the amount of work done by a system compared to the amount of heat generatedby, doing that work, dS \u2265 0, on that basis the thesis puts forward a premise of balance andmoderation. This work has attempted to address how sustainability philosophy, or culturein engineeringmight drive development towards net positive outcomes, rather than the currentfocus on minimizing negative impacts on the environment and society\u201d.5.0 ConclusionHow can you drive forward the concept of sustainable development? Social responsibility,transparency needs to replace profit driven values. In order properly to address sustainabilityin engineering, engineers must work inside their institutional boundaries but outside theboundaries of their professional knowledge, to cause integration between different profes-sional domains. Danger of present repeating the past mistakes. We need agreed languageand principles to engage in transparent dialogue. Engineers are not separated from societyand engineers have a greater moral obligation to stop climate change. Engineers are capableof producing radically different process changes in the context of severe limits on the con-sumption of primary physical resources. However, all engineered solution will always belimited by the same physical principals that govern our universe therefore limitations willexist within sustainable development. The facts are that most people driving the motion lack146THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE: IMPACTS ANDRESPONSESscientific training to gain an understanding of the essence of the problem.We need an engin-eering perspective. Hence, it is surprising that most of the climate change discussions aredominated by non engineers and scientist. For instance I recently attended a conference onwith a specific theme on environment, where I was the only engineer voicing an engineeringperspective to sustainability, furthermore most of the policies that were tabled had little sci-entific or engineering point of view. Most of the papers presented were hypothetical thatlacked any sense of realism, i.e. one presentation suggested genetically modifying carnivoresto stop them eating herbivores, tigers verses gazelles. The title and the content of some en-vironmental conferences were incongruous with reality. In fact In all intents and purposesthe facts remain those kinds of conferences and gathering do contribute to climate change\u201cenvironmental footprint\u201d i.e. transportation, disposable plastic cups and paper printing usage,yielding little benefit to society. So how can engineers and consequently engineering practicesplay any significant positive role in climate change and sustainability? The engineeringprofession can make significant contribution towards the global aspiration of sustainabilityby recognising that the future cannot be a continuation of the past in response to climatechange. Since the development of technology provides innovation and economic success,as a concluding remark a question is posed what are the risks in focusing too strongly onclimate change innovation for its own ends and in not adequately applying technology effi-ciency to meet the needs of an expanding population which is expecting a higher quality oflife. Hence we argue that society is driven by growth, growth is determined by successivetechnology. Thus technological change compliments societal change and hence a subset ofclimate change and in due course sustainability. Therefore we propose the inclusion of anengineer\u2019s perspective on sustainable engineering perspective in any future sustainabilityfeasibility assessment discussions for austerity.ReferencesAlexander, C.

The onset\nof the Holocene in Southwest Asia was marked by a rapid\nclimatic shift to conditions warmer and generally wetter than at\nthe present day (Bar-Matthews et al., 1997; Roberts et al., 2008)\nand a renewed expansion of woodland and grassland\nvegetation.\nCoinciding with the last glacial\u2013interglacial climatic tran-\nsition (LGIT; 16\u20139 ka), there occurred the key stages in the\ndomestication of cereals and other crop plants, and animals\nincluding sheep, goats, pigs and cattle (Zohary and Hopf, 2000;\nBarker, 2006). In the so-called Fertile Crescent, the wild\nprogenitors of domestic cereals occur naturally today, having\nbeen much less widely distributed during glacial times\n(Hillman, 1996). The climatic warming associated with the\nLGIT offered greatly improved conditions for plant growth due\nto higher temperatures along with increased, but markedly\nseasonal, moisture availability (Wright, 1993). The initial\nexpansion of open grass parklands across the region provided\nan enhanced resource base for local hunter-gatherer commu-\nnities due to the natural occurrence of wild food plants\nincluding cereals and legumes. This supported considerable\npopulation growth and the adoption of a more sedentary way of\nlife, as recorded in Epipalaeolithic early Natufian sites in\nthe southern Levant (Bar-Yosef and Belfer-Cohen, 1992). The\nreversion to quasi-glacial conditions at the end of the\nLateglacial, coinciding with the late Natufian period, saw a\nreduction in the availability of many wild resources as those\nspecies intolerant of the cold and arid climatic conditions\nbecame locally extinct. This climatically driven collapse in\nwild resources has been cited as a potential catalyst for the\nemergence of cultivation in the region, evidence of which has\nbeen found within archaeobotanical remains at Abu Hureyra,\nlocated in the Euphrates Valley (Moore et al., 2000; Hillman\net al., 2001; but see Willcox, 2005). Sheep and goat\ndomestication appears to have taken place at broadly the\nsame time but further east, towards the Zagros mountains\n(Zeder and Hesse, 2000). By the time of the Pre-Pottery\nNeolithic B period (PPNB, ca. 10.6 ka onwards), sedentary\nvillage communities combining plant and animal domesticates\nbecame widespread across the Fertile Crescent region\n(Colledge et al., 2004; Rosen, 2007a). From here, agriculture\nspread outwards from Southwest Asia, most notably westwards\ninto Greece, the southern Balkans and Europe beyond (van\nAndel and Runnels, 1995).\nThe beginning of agriculture was not only influenced by\nenvironmental changes, but it also greatly increased the\npotential of newly settled human communities to modify\ntheir natural surroundings. Early human impacts on Eastern\nMediterranean landscapes have not been easily identified\nin pollen records from lake cores (Willis and Bennett, 1994). In\npart, this is because many of the palynological indicators used\nto identify prehistoric crop husbandry in temperate Europe (e.g.\nCerealia-type pollen) are present naturally in the Mediterranean\nregion and so do not provide a diagnostic indicator of farming\nactivity. However, another potential explanation is that\npre-Neolithic baseline \u2018primaeval\u2019 vegetation may never\nhave existed in some of Southwest Asia\u2019s landscapes. It is\ntherefore possible that significant human impacts began even\nbefore vegetation had completed its adjustment to the shift in\nclimate at the end of the last glacial period.\nOne important but relatively neglected component of\nlandscape change during the climatic and cultural transition\nbetween 16 and 9 ka is the role of wildfire. Wildfires modify\nvegetation composition and structure, as well as altering the\navailability of natural resources for human groups. Fire\nfrequency and intensity are determined by a range of naturalCopyright \u0001 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.factors including biomass availability, a seasonally dry climate\nand ignition sources, but fire is also one of our oldest tools of\nenvironmental management. Fire was a tool used by Native\nAmericans (e.g. Clark and Royall, 1995; Keeley, 2002) and the\nAboriginal populations of Australia (e.g. Kershaw et al., 1997)\nto manage and manipulate vast tracts of landscape. We\ntherefore hypothesise that changing burning regimes in the\nEastern Mediterranean influenced, and were in turn influenced\nby, the transition to Neolithic agriculture in this region.\nLewis (1972) was one of the first to recognise the potential\nimportance of fire in the process of plant domestication in\nSouthwest Asia. He proposed, partly from ethnographic\nanalogy with Native California, that burning was employed\nas a technique of landscape management during the \u2018broad-\nspectrum revolution\u2019 that formed a key part of the pathway to\nplant domestication in the Eastern Mediterranean region. Lewis\nargued that \u2018the judicious use of fire could increase and\nimprove the production of herbaceous plants\u2019 (Lewis, 1972,\np. 206), specifically large, hard-grained grasses, along with\n\u2018those animals most dependent on [plant] growth\u2019. Some of\nthe wild progenitors of domesticated plant species would\nhave been promoted through low-intensity ground fires that are\ncommonplace in Mediterranean-type ecosystems during the\nsummer dry season (Zohary and Hopf, 2000; Grove and\nRackham, 2001). On the other hand, fires can also have\ndeleterious effects on large-seeded annual grasses, especially if\nadversely timed (Blumler, 1991; Hillman, 1996). More\ngenerally, wildfires act to maintain open grasslands, promoting\ntheir growth and retarding the encroachment of trees (Naveh\nand Carmel, 2003). Based on this, Roberts (2002) postulated\nthat wildfires, at least partly of anthropogenic origin,\ncontributed to the delay in postglacial woodland recolonisation\nof the drier, interior areas of Southwest Asia. In contrast to the\nwetter coastal mountains which were rapidly reafforested\nduring the LGIT, in south central\u2013eastern Anatolia and western\nIran maximum arboreal pollen values were not reached until\nmid Holocene times (van Zeist and Bottema, 1991; Wick et al.,\n2003). Previously accepted explanations for this delay \u2013\nnotably a slow inferred increase in effective moisture avail-\nability during the first half of the Holocene (e.g. Roberts and\nWright, 1993) \u2013 have become increasingly difficult to sustain in\nthe face of independent palaeoclimatic evidence that the early\nHolocene was wetter than at present in the Eastern Mediterra-\nnean (Bar-Matthews et al., 1997; Jones et al., 2007; Roberts\net al., 2008).\nIn this study, we investigate the changing climate, vegetation,\nwildfire and human activity in Southwest Asia \u2013 and the\nrelationship between them \u2013 during the LGIT. In order to trace\nthe fire history of this region, we use microscopic charcoal from\nlake sediment records. Micro-charcoal analysis is now well\nestablished as a means of reconstructing local, regional and\neven global records of biomass burning (Carcaillet et al., 2002;\nPower et al., 2008; Conedera et al., 2009). Most previous\nresearch into long-term fire activity in the Eastern Mediterra-\nnean has been of low temporal resolution and carried out as an\nadjunct to pollen analytical studies (e.g. Yasuda et al., 2000).\nHere we present two new micro-charcoal records which span\nthe LGIT: one from south central Anatolia, the other from the\nsouthern Levant. Through the use of complementary multi-\nproxy data, these microscopic charcoal records are linked to\nchanges in climate (based on stable oxygen isotope ratios),\nvegetation cover (via pollen data) and human activity (from\narchaeological excavations and surveys). Data derive either\nfrom the same sediment core sequence, or from locations that\nare geographically close by and which should have experi-\nenced the same environmental and cultural history. In this way,\nwe attempt to relate shifts in regional fire activity to differentJ.

For example, shifts in fire\nhistory records that are \u2018out of phase\u2019 with d18O-inferred\nclimatic changes but associated with corroborating archae-\nological evidence would be consistent with direct anthropo-\ngenic causation. Finally, we present a regional synthesis of\nEastern Mediterranean fire activity, comparing the two new\nrecords against other published micro-charcoal sequences from\nSouthwest Asia in order to test for regionally coherent trends.Study areasSouth central Turkey\nThe key data presented in this paper derive from Akgo\u00a8l at the\neastern end of the Konya basin (378 300 N, 338 440 E; \u00011000 m\nabove sea level; Fig. 1). Until it was drained during the 1980s,\nthis was the largest residual lake of Pleistocene palaeolake\nKonya. The Akgo\u00a8l depression consisted of a central saline\nplaya, the main lake (\u000150 km2 in extent, but only 1\u20132 m deep),\nalong with a Pleistocene beach ridge which separated the main\nlake from Adabag\u02d8 marsh (Roberts et al., 1999). The principal\ninflow entered the lake through the Zanopa River, which is in\nturn fed by the largest karstic water spring of the Konya Basin at\nIvriz (Leng et al., 1999). Minor freshwater inputs also entered\nAkgo\u00a8l from ephemeral streams running off the limestone hills to\nthe south of the lake basin. The primary outflow of Akgo\u00a8l was a\nsink-hole (\u2018du\u00a8den\u2019) on the southern margin of the lake basin.\nThe natural vegetation of the Konya Plain was classified by\nZohary (1973) as Xero-Euxinian, characterised by either broad-\nleaved steppe forest or grass steppe. These are transitional\nvegetation communities which contain dwarf shrubs, grasses\nand scattered trees. Deciduous oaks (e.g. Quercus pubescens\nand Q. rober) tend to dominate the tree flora on surrounding\nuplands but Pistacia spp., Juniperus spp. and some Pinus spp.Figure 1 Location of the study sites, lake basins, cave and archaeological\nCopyright \u0001 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.also occur, along with wild fruit trees (e.g. Pomoideae).\nHowever, the longevity of grazing in the area has resulted in the\nnatural vegetation been replaced by Irano-Turanian ground\nflora characterised by Stipa\u2013Brometum (Zohary, 1973).\nFollowing the drainage of the lake and surrounding marshes\nduring the 1980s, the area has been turned over to agriculture.\nOwing to the elevation and distance from the coast, the climate\nof central Turkey is semi-arid and semi-continental. Mean\nannual precipitation on the Konya plain is 250\u2013300 mm a\u00021,\n30% of which falls in spring (Tu\u00a8rkes\u00b8, 2003); summer rainfall is\nrare. Average temperatures range from \u000228C in January up to\n248C in July (Tu\u00a8rkes\u00b8, 2003). The combination of cold, moist\nwinters and hot, dry summers results in a regional moisture\ndeficiency. On the surrounding uplands, precipitation rises to\n500 mm a\u00021, and in winter much of this falls as snow.\nWithin the Konya Basin there are important early Holocene\narchaeological sites, several of which have been excavated.\nThey include Neolithic\u2013Chalcolithic settlement mounds at\nC\u00b8atalho\u00a8yu\u00a8k, Can Hasan and Boncuklu, and the P\u0131narbas\u00b8\u0131\nrockshelter site (Figs 1 and 2); they testify that the Konya plain\nwas the scene of settled village life and early agriculture from\nat least ca. 9.5 ka, along with evidence of earlier proto-\nagricultural communities (Baird, 2002, 2005).The southern Levant\nA fire history record is also presented from Lake Hula in Israel,\nwhich is situated \u000170 m above sea level in the Levantine\nsection of the Syro-African rift system (see Fig. 1). Lakes and\nswamps have occupied this area of the Jordan Rift Valley since\nthe early Quaternary due to the presence of a basaltic block\nwhich serves to dam the basin (Horowitz, 1979; Baruch and\nBottema, 1991). Prior to drainage of the shallow lake in the late\n1950s, open water covered an area of 5\u201310 km2, with a similar\narea of swampland to the north. Lake water flowed out south viasites referred to in this paper\nJ.

However, there is a strong climatic\ngradient running from the subtropical climate of the northern\nLevant to the semi-arid areas of the south, with the severity of\nthe summer drought varying along this gradient (Ben-Gai et al.,\n1998). There is also considerable variation in precipitation and\ntemperature with altitude; e.g. mean annual precipitation in\nthe Jordan Valley measures 450\u2013650 mm a\u00021, whereas in the\nmountains it measures 500\u20131000 mm a\u00021 (Baruch and\nBottema, 1999). As with precipitation and temperature, there\nare variations in vegetation associated with altitude. In the\nGolan Heights to the east of Lake Hula, the Q. ithaburensis\nparkland is replaced by Quercus ilex. The slopes of Upper\nGalilee are characterised by steppe forest dominated by\nPistacia atlantica at the lower elevations, to be replaced\nby Mediterranean maquis at higher elevations (Baruch and\nBottema, 1999). As in south central Turkey, due to the longevity\nof human occupation of this area, the natural vegetation has\nbeen greatly modified though grazing and cultivation; therefore\nthe oak parkland of the Hula Valley sides only occurs sparsely\nin areas of protected land (Baruch and Bottema, 1999).\nThe area surrounding Lake Hula contains one of the most\nimportant Epipalaeolilithic archaeological sites: Ain Mallaha.\nThis site contains evidence of a long episode of Natufian\noccupation which includes the transition from the Lateglacial\nInterstadial through the cooling of the Lateglacial Stadial (Valla\net al., 2007) (Fig. 2). Further south, in the Jordan Valley, other\narchaeological settlements record the cultural shifts that took\nplace during the LGIT associated with the transition from\nhunter-gatherer communities to the emergence of sedentary\nagricultural settlements (Bar-Yosef and Belfer-Cohen, 1992).MethodsLake coring and sampling resolution\nAkgo\u00a8l was originally cored in 1977 (core ADA77), primarily for\npollen analysis (see Bottema and Woldring, 1984, for details),\nand then re-cored as part of the KOPAL project in 1995 (cores\nAGL95A/B) using an Eijkelkamp vibro-corer. A range ofCopyright \u0001 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.geochemical and palaeoecological indicators have been\nanalysed on the KOPAL cores, including pollen, diatoms and\nstable oxygen isotopes (d18O) (the latter reported in Leng et al.,\n1999). AGL95A was dated using radiocarbon, luminescence\nand U-series (U\u2013Th) dating, and wider sedimentological\nanalyses were also conducted (see Roberts et al., 1999).\nAdditional analyses of micro-charcoals and phytoliths were\nconducted on the AGL95A as part of the study presented in this\npaper. The Lake Hula core analysed here was taken by\nU. Baruch and S. Bottema in 1987 using a Dachnowsky corer as\npart of their palynological research.Microscopic charcoal analysis\nFire events produce a pulse in charcoal that is rapidly\ntransported away from a fire site through airborne and fluvial\ntransport mechanisms, and thereby become incorporated into\nlake sediments (Patterson et al., 1987). Reconstructing an\naccurate fire history record is dependent on identifying these\npulses of charcoal within sedimentary records. Traditional\napproaches to sampling palaeoenvironmental proxies,\nwhereby spot (i.e. fixed-interval) sampling strategies are\nemployed, are not necessarily suited to reconstructing records\nof fire activity as they can lead to peaks in charcoal\nconcentrations being missed. Therefore a contiguous sampling\nstrategy was adopted for the Akgo\u00a8l sequence above 440 cm, this\nsection of the core corresponding to the time period relevant to\nthis study (Roberts et al., 1999). Contiguous 1 cm3 sediment\nsamples measuring 4.0\u0003 1.0\u0003 0.25 cm were extracted from\nthis section of core AGL95A using a Dremmel hand drill (model\n395). A higher sampling resolution of 2.0\u0003 1.0\u0003 0.5 cm was\napplied to the section of this core correlating to major climatic\nchanges: e.g. onset of the Holocene. The Lake Hula core\nsequence was incomplete due to sampling employed during\nprevious analyses and the loss of the top 2 m of the core and the\nsection between 10 and 12 m. Therefore it was only possible to\nconduct a fixed-interval sampling strategy for microscopic\ncharcoal analysis. 1 cm3 sediment samples were taken every\n8 cm for the lower portion of the core spanning the Lateglacial\u2013\nHolocene transition, and every 32 cm for the upper portion of\nthe core corresponding to the mid\u2013late Holocene.\nAfter adding Lycopodium tablets to enable estimation of\ncharcoal concentrations, samples were prepared using density\nseparation (Turner, 2007). The density separation method wasJ.

(2008a) to have a higher\nrecovery than other published methods for the fine charcoal\nfraction, and more than 10 times the recovery of standard\npollen preparation method. Samples were initially treated with\n10% HCl to disaggregate the sediments and then passed\nthrough a 180mm mesh to remove (and retain) the larger,\npotentially more fragile charcoal particles that could fragment\nduring the preparation and result in a potential overestimation\nof the charcoal concentration of a sample. Lithium hetero-\npolytungstate with a specific gravity of 2.5 was used to separate\nthe<180mm microscopic charcoal particles from the sediment\nmatrix. These were then mounted on a standard microscope\nslide, and all charcoal particles within each field of view were\ncounted using a BX100 high-power light microscope at 200\u0003\nmagnification, until a count of 250 Lycopodium spores was\nreached. Micro-charcoal particles were identified based on a\nset of diagnostic criteria, primarily that they had to be jet black\nin colour, with straight edges, and with the presence of a blue\nhue on edges (Turner et al., 2008a).Pollen analysis\nSubsamples were taken at regular \u000116 cm intervals throughout\nthe length of core AGL95A and subjected to standard\nprocessing procedures (Faegri and Iversen, 1989; Moore\net al., 1991). This involved digestion in 10% HCl, followed\nby treatment with 10% NaOH. Clay-rich samples were\nsubjected to 5% Na4P2O7 and sieved at 5mm and 150mm\nmesh sieves. Minerogenic samples were treated with 60% HF\nacid before Erdtman\u2019s acetolysis. Lycopodium tablets were\nadded to calculate pollen concentrations and samples were\nmounted in glycerine jelly.\nPollen grains and other palynomorphs were counted on a\nNikon Labophot-2 microscope at 200\u0003 and 400\u0003 magnifi-\ncation traversing at regularly spaced intervals until the pollen\nsum of 350 grains was reached. Critical identifications were\nconducted under oil immersion at 1000\u0003 magnification\ntogether with phase contrast. Identifications were aided by\nthe keys, descriptions and microphotographs contained within\nMoore et al. (1991), Reille (1992), van Bentham et al. (1984)\nand Punt et al. (1991). Reference pollen was also consulted.\nPlant nomenclature follows Flora Europaea (Tutin et al., 1964).\nIdentification of algal and fungal microfossils was aided by the\ndescriptions and microphotographs by van Geel (1986) and van\nGeel et al. (1989). Conventions for the degree of taxonomic\ncertainty follow Berglund and Ralska-Jasiewiczowa (1986).Phytolith analysis\nPhytoliths are silica bodies that form casts of plant epidermal\ntissue during the life of a plant. Following the decay of plant\nmatter phytoliths are readily preserved in sediments and are\ncommonly recovered in archaeological and natural deposits.\nThey are formed most abundantly within grasses, sedges and\nother monocotyledons, although they also occur within the\nleaves, bark and wood of dicotyledonous shrubs and trees.\nPhytoliths were extracted from the Akgo\u00a8l and Hula core\nsediments at intervals comparable to those examined for micro-\ncharcoal. An aliquot of \u0001800 mg of fine-grained sediment\n(<0.25 mm) was processed for each sample. Calcium carbon-\nates were removed by adding 10% HCl. The samples were then\nwashed in filtered water and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min.\nClays were dispersed by agitating the samples in a 20 mL\nCopyright \u0001 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.solution of sodium hexametaphosphate (calgon), and removed\nby settling the sediment through a column of filtered water and\ndecanting the suspended clay fraction. Colloidal organic matter\nwas then removed by burning the sample in a muffle furnace at\n5008C for 2 h. The remaining sediment was transferred to a\n15 mL polypropylene centrifuge tube, and 3 mL of sodium\npolytungstate heavy-density solution of 2.3 specific gravity was\nadded to the tube. The sample was agitated and centrifuged at\n800 rpm for 10 min. The suspense containing the phytolith\nmaterial was poured into a clean 15 mL centrifuge tube,\nwashed in distilled water, and centrifuged to clean. The\nremaining pellet was dried and weighed, and then a weighed\naliquot of about 2 mg was mounted on a microscope slide using\nEntellan as a mounting medium. The samples were counted at\n400\u0003 magnification using an Olympus BH-2 optical micro-\nscope. The number of microscope fields counted were\nrecorded and the number of phytoliths per gram sedimentResultsAkgo\u00a8l\nThe full AGL95A core sequence is 847 cm long and consists of\npeaty clays (0\u2013120 cm), a buried soil horizon (120\u2013128 cm)\noverlying pale-grey, and calcareous clay marls with increasing\ndetritus silt below 610 cm. There is a dark organic horizon at\n282\u2013286 cm and a pebble layer at 440\u2013446 cm (Fig. 3).\nPrevious dating and sedimentological analyses allowed a\nnumber of hiatuses in sedimentation to be identified in the\nAkgo\u00a8l sequence. In terms of the present study, the most\nimportant of these occurred at 440 cm and\u0001126 cm. The hiatus\nat 440 cm is marked by a desiccation layer and an abrupt\nchange in the diatom assemblages (Roberts et al., 1999; J. Reed,\npers. comm.), while that at 126 cm corresponds to the buried\nsoil horizon, when the site became terrestrialised. Between\nthese depths, the AGL95 core sequence covers the time period\nbetween ca. 15 and 9.5 ka; sedimentation subsequently\nrecommenced at ca. 6.5 ka . In addition, comparison of the\npollen records shows a distinct, short-lived Betula-dominated\nphase present in the ADA77 core (Bottema and Woldring,\n1984) that is absent in the pollen record from core AGL95A\n(Roberts et al., 2006; W. Eastwood, pers. comm.). This implies\nthat a third minor hiatus or other disturbance occurred in\nAGL95A at the very beginning of the Holocene, probably\nrepresenting a few centuries and possibly linked to spatial shifts\nin the depo-centre within the lake during this climatic warming\nstage. There is no evidence of a fall in lake level at this time.\nThese hiatuses were taken into consideration in the construc-\ntion of the age model summarised in Table 1. Proxy-climate\ndata from the AGL95A sequence exhibit changes that appear\nsimilar in timing and magnitude to those of the Lateglacial in\nnorthwestern Europe (viz. Bo\u00a8lling\u2013Allero\u00a8d interstadial and\nYounger Dryas stadial). However, it is not yet possible to make\nconclusions regarding the precise synchronicity of these events\nand therefore they are named here the Lateglacial Interstadial\nand Lateglacial Stadial (following Jones et al., 2007).\nThe Akgo\u00a8l d18O record has been demonstrated to respond to\nchanges in both the precipitation:evaporation balance of the\nlake as well as freshwater inputs from the Zanopa River (Leng\net al., 1999). Between ca. 15 and ca. 11 ka , there was a\nfluctuating trend towards more negative d18O values, reflecting\na shift towards generally wetter conditions during the LGIT\n18(Fig. 4). These negative d O values persisted throughout the\nJ.

The onset of the Holocene was\nmarked by a reduction in Artemisia and Chenopods, followed\nby the gradual expansion of trees. The early Holocene was\ncharacterised by open grass parklands which included Pistacia\nand the continued expansion of mesic tree species (Bottema\nand Woldring, 1984).\nAs is evident in Figs 3 and 4, strongly fluctuating levels of\ncharcoal were recorded in Akgo\u00a8l through the LGIT.

The shallow, open morphology of Akgo\u00a8l (Fig. 5)\ncombined with the flat, open landscape of the Konya Basin\nmeans that, in contrast to the crater\u2013lake sequences discussed\nin Turner et al. (2008b), Akgo\u00a8l probably recorded a spatially\nheterogeneous fire history signal. Charcoal from both local and\nregional fire events is likely to have reached the lake primarily\nthrough aeolian transport processes.Interpretation\nIn order to interpret the Akgo\u00a8l core in terms of causal agencies,\nthe micro-charcoal record should be partitioned between\nprimarily local and primarily regional fire events. This is\nparticularly important for the large peak in charcoal recorded at\nca. 13.0 ka. Fine resolution analysis of both AGL95A and\nparallel core AGL95B shows that this charcoal peak was not\nlimited to a single sample, but included two maxima over a\ndepth interval of >4 cm (Turner, 2007). Charcoal was also\nabundant in the >180mm fraction from this layer, while pollen\nwas very poorly preserved. Together, these facts are consistent\nwith a fire of local origin.

This appears to\nconfirm that the main fuel source for the 13 ka fire(s) derived\nfrom Akgo\u00a8l marsh itself, not from the surrounding dryland\nvegetation. Diatoms from this level are dominated by\nperiphytic taxa, consistent with a shallow, marshy lake at this\ntime (J. Reed, pers. comm.). The most likely explanation for the\n\u2018burning horizon\u2019 is that the marsh surface desiccated during a\ndrought interval and that the reedbeds ignited. A possibly\nsimilar burning of the marsh surface had occurred just prior to\ncoring in 1977 (Bottema and Woldring, 1984, p. 132). The\nsource of ignition for the 13 ka event could have been climatic\n(lightning), volcanic (Late Pleistocene eruptions occurred in the\nvicinity (Fig. 5); see Kuzucuog\u02d8lu et al., 1998), cosmic (cf.\nFirestone et al., 2007) or anthropogenic, since there is\narchaeological evidence for Epipalaeolithic hunter-gatherers\nin the Konya plain at this time (D. Baird, pers. comm.). This\nburning event, although potentially only of local significance,\ncoincides with a positive d18O trend between ca. 13.3 and ca.\n12.8 ka associated with the climatic shift from the wetter\ninterstadial to the subsequent colder, drier stadial.\nOther micro-charcoal maxima in core AGL95A have\nphytoliths dominated not by sedges and reeds but by woody\ndicots of terrestrial origin (Fig. 4); nor are they burnt. The overall\npollen record also contains substantial arboreal values of non-\nlocal origin. This implies that micro-charcoal influx through the\nrest of the core was derived primarily from terrestrial vegetation\nsources rather than burning of the marsh surface. Other than the\n13 ka burning event, the micro-charcoal record from Akgo\u00a8l is\ntherefore interpreted in terms of regional-scale fire regimes.\nComparisons between the remaining charcoal record and other\nproxy evidence (pollen and d18O) from AGL95A do not show as\nclear a relationship between climate, biomass and fire as in\nsome other fire history reconstructions from this region during\nCopyright \u0001 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.the LGIT (e.g. Eski Acigol; Turner et al., 2008b). Nonetheless,\nmaximum micro-charcoal influx of regional origin occurs\nimmediately following dry to wet climatic shifts at the start of\nthe Lateglacial Interstadial (ca. 14 ka) and again during the early\nHolocene (ca. 11 ka), presumably reflecting increases in\navailable biomass. Pollen data suggest that grasslands \u2013\nincluding wild cereals \u2013 would have reached their greatest\nextent at these times, and dry season burning of grasses seems\nlikely to have provided one of the main charcoal sources. By\ncontrast, by mid Holocene times, woody biomass may have\nprovided the predominant fuel source for wildfires. Burning\nintensities were notably low during the Lateglacial Stadial\nwhen chenopod and Artemisia pollen reached maximumLake Hula\nThe core sequence recovered by Baruch and Bottema measures\n1625 cm and consists of pale grey-buff calcareous clay marls.\nThe results of 14C dating and palynological analyses are\nreported in Baruch and Bottema (1991, 1999). There has been\nconsiderable debate in the published literature regarding the\nchronology of this sequence. Cappers et al. (1998, 2002)\nidentified a \u2018hard water\u2019 effect, but proposed relatively minor\ncorrections to the 14C dates based on d13C determinations. A\nmore radical reassessment of the chronology by Rossignol-\nStrick (1995) and Meadows (2005) identified a much larger\ncorrection factor of up to 5500 14C a based on the analysis of\nthe contemporary isotopic composition of Lake Hula\u2019s water\nand comparison with regional palynological records.

Whatever their\nprecise age, the micro-charcoal data can be compared directly\nagainst pollen data from this Hula core sequence to reveal past\nfire\u2013vegetation relationships, as they derive from the same\nsedimentary sequence.\nPollen data for the basal part of the core of Late Pleistocene\nage (Baruch and Bottema, 1999) show that Quercus spp. and\nGramineae were common, indicating the presence of open,\noak-dominated parkland (Fig. 6). Chenopodiaceae and\nArtemisia spp. were also represented, indicating a steppic\ncomponent to the parkland vegetation communities, but they\nwere less significant than at Akgo\u00a8l and other interior sites during\nthe Lateglacial period. The onset of the Holocene (using the\nMeadows chronology) saw a progressive increase in arboreal\npollen values as trees, particularly Quercus itaburensis, began\nto expand as climate warmed. As trees and grasses expanded\nthere was a subsequent reduction in steppic herbs.\nd18O analyses were conducted by Stiller and Hutchinson\n(1980) on an earlier core sequence taken from Lake Hula. In\naddition to the chronological uncertainty discussed above and\nthe need for inter-core correlation, there are difficulties in\ninterpreting this stable isotope record because of the presence\nof detrital carbonates in the sediments. Whether because of\nthis, or because Hula is an open, throughflow lake, d18O values\nare strongly negative and show only minor downcore changes.\nThis means that stable isotope data from Hula do not provide a\nrecord of regional changes in water balance (Roberts et al.,\n2008). Instead, we can use the well-dated d18O record from\nspeleothems in Soreq Cave, Israel, to provide a record of hydro-\nclimatic changes over the Lateglacial\u2013Holocene transition in\nthe southern Levant (Bar-Matthews et al., 1997). Climatic\namelioration was recorded in the Lateglacial Interstadial at\nSoreq, with inferred annual precipitation of 550\u2013750 mm and\ntemperatures of 14.5\u201318.08C, followed by a reversal to glacial\nd18O values during the Lateglacial Stadial as a result of a\nreduction an annual precipitation. By contrast, the early\nHolocene witnessed high precipitation values (675\u2013\n950 mm a\u00021). The expansion in oak woodland on the hills\naround Hula would thus have coincided with the climatic shift\nfrom cold and arid to warm and moist conditions between 12.0\nand 9.5 ka.\nCopyright \u0001 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Charcoal influx values fluctuate strongly during the basal part\nof the Hula core but show an initial decreasing trend (15.7\u2013\n14.5 m, inferred age 13.0\u201311.5 ka) followed by a marked\nincrease to reach maximum values for the whole sequence\n(14.5\u201312.0 m; 11.5 to ca. 9 ka; Fig. 6). Micro-charcoals broadly\nmirror the trend in deciduous oak pollen, suggesting that\nwildfire was limited primarily by the availability of woody\nbiomass, which itself was limited by moisture and warmth\nduring this transitional period. Cerealia-type pollen experi-\nences its lowest percentage values during this interval of forest\ngrowth and greatest fire frequency/intensity. Later in the\nHolocene (above \u00019.7 m) micro-charcoal flux gradually\ndecreases to reach a minimum during early historic times.\nClimatic desiccation and landscape transformation by agro-\npastoralism seem to have combined to reduce fuel availabilityInterpretation\nLake Hula has a similar morphology to Akgo\u00a8l, insofar as prior to\ndrainage it was a large, open, shallow lake with surrounding\nmarsh. Therefore it is likely to have received a spatially\nheterogeneous fire history signal. However, unlike Akgo\u00a8l there\nis no evidence that would indicate the occurrence of localised\nburning events on the marsh surface during the core record.\nThere are no charcoal-rich horizons, and micro-charcoal\nmaxima correlate with dicot rather than reed/sedge phytolith\npeaks (Fig. 6). This would appear to reflect a relatively minor\ncontribution of locally derived charcoal to this sequence.\nThe Lateglacial Interstadial in the southern Levant was\ncharacterised by oak\u2013grass parkland which expanded in\nresponse to the regional climatic warning. Oak\u2013grass parkland\nis characterised by regular ground fires (Naveh, 1974), and the\nfew samples that were analysed from this period do show\nmoderate\u2013high regional fire activity. Despite the reversion to\ncooler and drier conditions during the Lateglacial Stadial, the\nseverity of the climatic deterioration was not as great here as\nelsewhere in the Eastern Mediterranean (Bar-Matthews et al.,\n1997; Jones et al., 2007). Although arboreal pollen values\ndeclined, trees remained present throughout the record, and\nGramineae continued to dominate over steppic herbs in the\nnon-arboreal pollen component. Despite the reduction in\nbiomass availability there was still adequate fuel to support fire\nactivity throughout this period, as indicated by the continued \u2013\nthough reduced \u2013 presence of micro-charcoal. There is also\nwell-documented evidence of human activity around Lake\nHula during Lateglacial times, in the form of the Natufian\nsettlement at Ain Mallaha. These peoples operated a\nbroad-spectrum economy that involved harvesting of large\nand small-seeded grasses including wild cereals (Rosen,\n2007b). It is therefore possible that seasonal burning was used\nas a form of environmental management to prevent woodland\nencroachment at this time, and that this contributed to the fire\nrecord (Roberts, 2002). Hominin use of fire in the Hula basin is\nattested as long ago as 0.8 Ma (Alperson-Afil, 2008).\nThe climatic amelioration at the start of the Holocene\npromoted an increase in net primary productivity of the\nvegetation community surrounding the Hula basin, particularly\nof oak woodland, which expanded much more rapidly than it\ndid in central Anatolia. This in turn increased the fuel load and\nthe potential for increased fire activity, which is reflected in\nhigh charcoal influx to the lake at this time. The association\nwith the maximum oak extension and with dicot phytoliths\nsuggests that woody biomass rather than grasses provided the\nprincipal supply of fuel. The role of human firing setting is\nJ.

People have altered this\nrelationship since Palaeolithic times through their manipula-\ntion and management of vegetation communities and through\ndeliberate fire-setting (Alperson-Afil, 2008). Therefore for both\nnatural and anthropogenic factors, biomass plays a central role\nin determining fire frequency and intensity.\nIn addition to the records from Akgo\u00a8l and Hula presented\nhere, there are a number of other Southwest Asian micro-\ncharcoal records of biomass burning available for comparison\nthat span the LGIT, including Eski Ac\u0131go\u00a8l in central Anatolia,\nGhab in northwestern Syria and Lake Van in southeastern\nTurkey (Fig. 1 and Table 2). Whereas Eski Ac\u0131go\u00a8l was analysed\nusing identical analytical methods to those described in this\npaper, the Ghab and Van sequences used different extraction\nmethods and sampling strategies, and some caution is therefore\nneeded when making comparison with them. The Eski Ac\u0131go\u00a8l\ncrater lake sediment sequence was contiguously sampled at\n4 cm intervals (Turner et al., 2008b), and provides a regional\nrecord of biomass burning from the LGM to the late Holocene.\nd18O and pollen analysis from the same sequence shows a close\ncorrespondence between hydro-climate, vegetation and burn-\ning regimes during the LGIT. The Ghab Valley forms part of the\nsame rift valley system as the Hula basin and, like Hula,\noriginally comprised an extensive area of marshland sur-\nrounded by wooded hills. Charcoal flux may therefore have\nincluded both local fires on the marsh surface and regional\nupland fires. Micro-charcoal was counted as an adjunct to\npollen analysis both here (Yasuda et al., 2000) and at Lake Van\n(Wick et al., 2003). The latter study covered the period from the\nLateglacial Interstadial onwards, and presented micro-charcoal\ninflux as well as concentration data. It also included stable\nisotope and elemental chemistry analyses as proxies for past\nclimate and lake water balance. Because Van is a very large and\ndeep lake, micro-charcoal recruitment would have been\nCopyright \u0001 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.regional to supra-regional in extent including the surrounding\nsteppe parkland along with some areas of montane forest.\nComparison between these different records is also hindered by\nissues of chronology, partly due to the different dating methods\nthat have been utilised (Table 2). The original Van varve\nchronology, for example, underestimates the age for the start\nof the Holocene by around 1 ka (Wick et al., 2003). By contrast,\nthe Eski Ac\u0131go\u00a8l and Ghab chronologies appear to overestimate\nthe age of the Pleistocene\u2013Holocene climato-stratigraphic\nboundary by ca. 0.4 ka and 0.9 ka , respectively (14C ages\nreported by Yasuda et al., 2000, are uncorrected mollusc ages,\nalthough van Zeist and Woldring, 1980, found a 900 a \u2018old\ncarbon\u2019 effect at Ghab; see Meadows, 2005, for further\ndiscussion). Notwithstanding these differences, regional pollen\nand isotope stratigraphies allow broad correlation between the\ndifferent sequences (Fig. 7).\nMicro-charcoal records of full glacial age are available only\nfrom Eski Ac\u0131go\u00a8l and Ghab, and in both cases they show low\nvalues, with charcoals often completely absent in samples\nolder than ca. 16 ka from the central Anatolian site (Fig. 7). At\nthis time the regional vegetation was dominated by drought-\ntolerant Chenopodiaceae\u2013Artemisia steppe. Glacial-age pollen\ninflux rates were low at sites such as Lake Van (e.g. Litt et al.,\n2009), and the adverse climate and restricted vegetation cover\nin interior areas of Southwest Asia meant that there was limited\nbiomass available to burn and consequently very few wildfires.\nBased on the low biomass availability and the paucity of\narchaeological evidence in central and eastern Anatolia,\nclimate is therefore likely to have been the main factor limiting\nfire activity at this time in interior regions. By contrast, tree\ncover survived better in some coastal areas, and at sites such as\nO\u00a8ku\u00a8zini Cave in southwestern Turkey (Emery-Barbier and\nThie\u00b4bault, 2005) there is archaeological evidence of anthro-\npogenic burning activity during this early Epipalaeolithic\nperiod.\nThe climatic warming associated with the Lateglacial\nInterstadial resulted in the partial replacement of cold steppe\nwith grass steppe in south central Turkey and the expansion of\nopen oak parkland in the Levant (van Zeist and Bottema, 1991).\nMicro-charcoal influx increased at the same time as a shift to\ngreater moisture availability, as indicated by d18O analyses at\nsites such as Akgo\u00a8l, Eski Ac\u0131go\u00a8l and Soreq cave. These climatic\nchanges led to an expansion in grasses which in turn provided\ngreater fuel availability for wildfire. Among them were\nlarge-seeded annual cereal grasses such as einkorn and wild\nbarley, whose harvesting provided a key catalyst for the cultural\nshift from mobile bands of hunter-gatherers to the establishment\nof larger, sedentary settlements (Bar-Yosef and Belfer-Cohen,\n1992).

The Lake Hula sequence probably\nonly covers the tail end of Lateglacial Interstadial, and it is\ntherefore difficult to assess whether or not people were exerting\nan influence on fire activity, although they were certainly living\naround its shores at this time. Although burning of the marsh\nsurface may have contributed to micro-charcoal influx at Ghab\nand Hula, it is only at Akgo\u00a8l that a distinct burnt layer of local\norigin has been identified, in this case by comparing charcoal\nagainst phytolith data from the same record (Fig. 4). Although\nthis ca. 13 ka event originated from localised burning of the\nreedbeds in the Konya basin, it may have its ultimate origin in\nthe regional climatic drying trend at the end of the Lateglacial\nInterstadial which led to desiccation of the marsh surface.\nMicro-charcoals were not counted systematically in the Zeribar\npollen record from northwestern Iran, but van Zeist (1967,\np. 311) noted \u2018numerous charcoal particles between 4.40 and\n3.80 m indicat[ing] that the vegetation on the dried lake bottom\nwas set on fire not infrequently\u2019. Although these particular samples\ndate to the mid Holocene, a similar argument may apply to\nabundant charred macrofossils present in the Zeribar core\nsamples of late Quaternary age (Wasylikowa, 2005, p.730).\nThe reversion to quasi-glacial conditions during the\nLateglacial Stadial had a significant impact on regional\nfire activity. In south central Turkey regional fire occurrence\nappears to have declined rapidly following the climatic\ndeterioration as the composition of the biomass changed\nfrom grass steppe back to drought-tolerant Chenopodiaceae\u2013\nArtemisia steppe. This reduction implies a continuing\noverriding impact of climate on fire activity in this region,\nwhich is consistent with a paucity of archaeological evidence\nfor human occupation of central Anatolia at this time. In the\nLevant, where the ecological and human effects of climatic\ncooling would have been less severe than in central Turkey, the\ndecline in fire occurrence through the Lateglacial Stadial was\nless marked. Although archaeological evidence indicates\nsignificant abandonment of settlement towards the desert\nedge at this time (Hillman et al., 2001), there was clear\ncultural continuity in better-watered regions nearer to the coast\nthrough the late Natufian period (ca. 13\u201311.7 ka; Byrd, 2005).\nPollen records show that vegetation in the Levant retained a\nsignificant cover of oaks and other trees during the Lateglacial\nStadial and that wild cereal stands continued to be present\n(Rosen, 2007a). Thus in the southern Levant both climatic and\nanthropogenic factors may have exerted an impact on fire\nregimes at this time.\nThe rapid climatic amelioration that marked the onset of the\nHolocene was associated with the replacement of cold steppe\nwith open grass-dominated parkland in south central and\neastern Turkey and expansion of oak woodlands in the Levant\n(van Zeist and Bottema, 1991). Micro-charcoal records imply\nthat there was an equally rapid increase in fire occurrence\nthroughout the region. Enhanced winter season moisture availability\npromoted vegetation growth, resulting in ample fuel being\navailable, while the advent of Mediterranean-type climate\nregimes (Wright, 1993) meant that there was seasonal drying\nout of plant biomass. In all three sites from central and eastern\nAnatolia, there is a sharp peak in micro-charcoal influx during\nthe first few centuries of the Holocene, suggesting a transient\nresponse as the vegetation\u2013wildfire system adjusted to the new\nclimate; this is consistent with an initial postglacial control over\nbiomass burning regimes that was natural rather than cultural.\nThe main fuel source for wildfires in this interior open parkland\nbiome during the early Holocene appears to have been grasses\nand herbs rather than trees. There are strikingly similar curves\nfor grass pollen percentages and micro-charcoal concentration\nat both Van and Eski Ac\u0131go\u00a8l through the LGIT (Fig. 7(A)). AnCopyright \u0001 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.association between maxima in grass pollen and charcoal\nduring the early Holocene also applied at some other\nMediterranean sites, such as Accesa in Italy (Vannie`re et al.,\n2008). Micro-charcoal and grass pollen values remained high\nthroughout the first two to three millennia of the Holocene in\nthe parkland zone of south central and eastern Anatolia, during\nwhich time aceramic Neolithic settlements became estab-\nlished. A strong positive correlation between charcoal influx\nand d18O values in the Eski Ac\u0131go\u00a8l record implies that over\ndecadal\u2013centennial timescales climate continued to act as the\n\u2018pace-maker\u2019 for burning regimes until at least ca. 10 ka, with\nfires being more frequent during periods of wetter climate and\nenhanced biomass production (Turner et al., 2008b). On the\nother hand, deliberate cultural fire-setting during the transition\nto full agriculture may have meant that fires occurred more\nfrequently, hence increasing the overall magnitude of micro-\ncharcoal flux peaks, even if not altering their timing on multi-\ndecadal to multi-centennial timescales. It is clear from\nanthracological analysis of macro-charcoals that by 9 ka wood\nfuel for human domestic use had to be transported from a\ndistance at sites such as C\u00b8atalho\u00a8yu\u00a8k in central Turkey (Asouti\nand Hather, 2001; Asouti, 2005). It should be borne in mind\nalso that Anatolian woodlands include many insect-pollinated\nspecies (Woldring and Cappers, 2001) so that some key woody\ntaxa (e.g. Amygdalus) are likely to be underrepresented in early\nHolocene pollen assemblages.\nThere is archaeological evidence for substantial village\ncommunities throughout the Levant during the early Holocene;\nfor example, in the Jordan Valley, the Damascus Basin and\nalong the middle Euphrates River (Bar-Yosef, 1998; Byrd,\n2005). It has been hypothesised that the proto-agricultural\npractices developed during the Lateglacial Stadial continued\nfor at least a thousand years alongside communities based on\nadvanced hunting-foraging, before being widely adopted as\nfully fledged farming during the PPNB and spreading out into\nAnatolia and beyond (Bar-Yosef, 1998; Colledge et al., 2004).\nIn terms of Levantine fire regimes, there is a clear positive\ncorrelation between oak pollen percentages and micro-\ncharcoal flux at Hula in Israel, whereas further north in Syria\u2019s\nGhab valley the phase of oak pollen maximum shows rather\nlow values for micro-charcoal concentration (Fig. 7(B)). Here\nthe early Holocene wildfire peak occurs later, after deciduous\noak pollen values had started to decline, but coincident instead\nwith an increase in pollen of pine and evergreen oak.\nAlternative explanations are possible for these contrasting\npollen\u2013charcoal correlations (which remain valid regardless of\nthe precise age of events in the two core records). Firstly,\nthey could reflect the wetter climate in the Jebel Ansariyeh\nmountains west of the Ghab compared to the Judean hills west\nof Hula; at times of maximum forest development, fires in the\nformer region may have been regulated not by fuel availability\nbut by drought episodes. Secondly, and alternatively,\ndifferences between the two areas could have been due to\ncontrasting histories of human burning regimes, with deliberate\nfiring being more common in the southern Levant early in the\nNeolithic (PPNA, PPNB), and later in northwestern Syria\n(ceramic Neolithic, Chalcolithic). In addition, it should be\nnoted that the Hula record is incomplete for the vegetation phases\nassociated with the highest charcoal concentrations at Ghab.ConclusionMicro-charcoal, stable isotope and pollen data show that there\nis a good correspondence between biomass burning regimes,J.

Climatic changes appear to have\nacted as the primary pacemaker of regional-scale fire histories\nover this time period, and they highlight the importance of\nwarmth and humidity as limiting factors in regional fire activity.\nIncreased moisture and higher temperatures promoted the\nprimary productivity of the vegetation community, in turn\nresulting in increased fuel availability. Fires were least frequent\non the cold, Chenopod\u2013Artemisia steppe that characterised\ninterior uplands during full glacial times and again during the\nLateglacial Stadial. This appears to have been associated with\nlow plant biomass, but hunter-gatherer populations \u2013 and\nhence human fire-setting \u2013 were also rather rare in south central\nand eastern Turkey during these periods. Such fires as did occur\ntherefore seem likely to have had a natural origin. In contrast,\nthe Levant was climatically less arid, better vegetated and much\nmore densely settled by Epipalaeolithic peoples at these times.\nBurning regimes, although reduced, were none the less\nmaintained at significant levels.\nFires were more frequent and/or larger at times of warmer,\nwetter but seasonally dry climate, namely the Lateglacial\nInterstadial and the early Holocene. These climatic conditions\nled to an increase in biomass production throughout Southwest\nAsia, associated with a rapid expansion of grassland across the\nAnatolian plateau and woodland across the coastal hills of the\nLevant. In both regions, wild cereals would have formed a\nsignificant component of the ground storey vegetation. South-\nwest Asia\u2019s grasslands reached their greatest extent during the\nearly Holocene, notwithstanding the fact that the climate was\nat least as moist (and in most areas moister) than at the present\nday. High micro-charcoal concentrations at this time show that\ndry-season burning was an integral part of these grass parkland\necosystems. This supports the hypothesis (Roberts, 2002) that\nfires played a key role in delaying by several millennia the\nspread of woodland across upland plateaux that were always\nclimatically marginal for tree growth. Pollen and micro-\ncharcoal records show that fire-maintained grasslands existed\nfor between 2 and 3 ka across south central and eastern Turkey\n(and also, by inference, northwestern Iran), at the same time as\nthe first aceramic Neolithic farming communities were being\nestablished. Fires also attained their maximum frequencies and/\nor intensities in the Levant during the early Holocene; however,\npollen data imply that here wood rather than grass provided the\nprincipal fuel source.\nWhile climatic changes appear to have acted as the principal\n\u2018pacemaker\u2019 for fire activity through the LGIT, those same shifts\nin climatic regime also strongly influenced human activities in\nSouthwest Asia, both directly (e.g. severe glacial age winter\ncold limiting settlement on the Anatolian plateau) and\nindirectly (e.g. availability of wild cereal stands). Human\npopulation densities increased at those times and in those\nregions when conditions were warmer and wetter, and during\nthe transition from hunting-foraging to farming there is\narchaeological evidence that Epipalaeolithic and Neolithic\ncommunities modified their local and \u2013 possibly \u2013 regional\nenvironments by their use of, and need for, fire (e.g. Asouti and\nHather, 2001; Emery-Barbier and Thie\u00b4bault, 2005). Human\nactions thus seem to have amplified the underlying, climati-\ncally paced shifts in fire regime during the transition to\nNeolithic agriculture. If correct, then fire frequencies may have\nbeen significantly higher during the Lateglacial and early\nHolocene than during the early parts of previous interglacial\nperiods (cf. Djamali et al., 2008; Litt et al., 2009), when\nanatomically modern humans were absent or rare in Southwest\nAsia. Because fire frequencies increased at those times and in\nthose areas where the human \u2018ecological footprint\u2019 was\ngreatest, it is difficult, indeed probably futile, to try to partition\nCopyright \u0001 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.burning regimes between natural and cultural drivers, since\nthey operated synergistically. What is not in doubt is that fire\nregimes changed markedly during the major climatic and\nenvironmental transition between ca. 16 and ca. 9 ka BP and\nthe parallel cultural-economic transition from hunter-foraging\nto agriculture and village life.\nAcknowledgements We are please to acknowledge the assistance of\nHenk Woldring, Lucia Wick, Jane Reed, Matt Jones, Dan Charman,\nHerb Wright, David Harris, Ann Kelly, Tim Absalom, Ben Meredith and\nthe late Sytze Bottema.
