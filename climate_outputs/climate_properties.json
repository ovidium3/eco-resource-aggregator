Introduction\nDespite improvements to climate models, observational systems, and methodologies, the estimated likely\nrange of equilibrium climate sensitivity has remained relatively unchanged from the Charney Report\n(Charney, 1979) to the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report\n(Collins et al., 2013). In both reports, the central estimate for climate sensitivity is 3 \u25e6C with a likely range\nof 1.5 to 4.5 \u25e6C. A recent review suggests that although a climate sensitivity below 2 \u25e6Cmay be inconsistent\nwith the current physical understanding of climate system feedbacks, the 1.5 to 4.5 \u25e6C range remains rela-\ntively unchanged (Knutti et al., 2017). The lack of convergence toward a single value does not imply a lack\nof knowledge, however, but rather the inherent difficulty of the problem. Estimates of climate sensitivity\nremain uncertain for a number of reasons, some of which are outlined in Hegerl et al. (2000) and remain rel-\nevant today. The first reason is uncertainty in observations. Many studies estimate climate sensitivity using\nhistorical observations of climate change. Due to instrumental errors, coverage gaps, and inhomogeneity in\nmeasurement practices, there is irreducible error in the time series of climate variables. The second reason\nis systematic/structural errors in models. Many studies derive estimates of climate sensitivity by comparing\nmodel output to observations (e.g., Forest et al., 2008; Knutti et al., 2003; Libardoni & Forest, 2013; Olson\net al., 2013). All models are approximations of reality and thus do not exactly match the climate system.\nThe last reason is chaotic or internal variability in the climate system. In the absence of external forcing,\nfluctuations in the atmosphere and ocean still occur due to processes and feedbacks active in the climate\nsystem. This unforced internal variability is embedded in any climate signal, and due to its chaotic nature,\nrepresents an irreducible uncertainty.\nHere, we show how estimates of climate sensitivity are affected by different estimates of internal variability.\nIn previouswork to evaluatemodel performance (Libardoni et al., 2018a, 2018b), a goodness-of-fit statistic is\nused that weighsmodel-to-observation residuals in temperature diagnostics by the internal variability of the\nclimate system (see equation (1)). In many methods (Aldrin et al., 2012; Olson et al., 2013; Sans\u00f3 & Forest,\n2009), internal variability is estimated from preindustrial control runs of atmosphere-ocean general circu-\nlation models (AOGCMs). In these runs, forcing patterns are fixed over long simulations and the coupled\nRESEARCH LETTER\n10.1029/2019GL082442\nKey Points:\n\u2022 Estimates are highly sensitive when\nusing a single source to approximate\ninternal variability\n\u2022 Probabilistic estimates are too\nnarrow if the internal variability\ncomes from a single model\n\u2022 Estimates tend to converge when\nenough samples of internal\nvariability are used\nSupporting Information:\n\u2022 Supporting Information S1\nCorrespondence to:\nC.

Thus far, we have only\nused one model to estimate the internal variability. Over 20 AOGCMs submitted preindustrial controls runs\nto the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5; Taylor et al., 2012). Due to structural dif-\nferences, the internal variability is not the same across all models and a single model does not span the full\nrange of variability. We show here that this has a significant impact on the calculation of probability distri-\nbutions for climate sensitivity and other climate system properties. At best, the uncertainty in the resulting\nestimates are similar when variability is estimated from a single model compared to when multiple mod-\nels are used, but the uncertainty is generally underestimated when just a single model is used to estimate\nthe variability.\nWe present the study as follows. In section 2, we identify the models that are used and how estimates of the\ninternal variability are derived from long control runs. Section 3 presents probability distributions derived\nfrom each of the variability estimates and proposes a method for combining estimates across multiple\nmodels. We conclude the study in section 4.\n2. Methods\nIn this work, we use the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Earth System Model (MESM; Sokolov et\nal., 2018) to simulate many possible climate states. Because MESM was developed frommodel components\nof Earth System Models, the climate system properties are determined by feedbacks within MESM rather\nthan constant parameters like in most intermediate complexity models. To simulate different climate states,\nwe vary model parameters to adjust the feedback strengths (e.g., the cloud feedback on climate sensitivity),\nwhich in turn depend on the model state vector. Using the 1,800-member ensemble of MESM described in\nLibardoni et al. (2018a), we derive estimates of the joint probability distribution function (PDF) of effective\nclimate sensitivity (ECS), effective ocean diffusivity (Kv), and the net anthropogenic aerosol forcing (Faer).\nEachmodel simulation adjusts the climate state to set the climate system properties, \ud835\udf03 = (ECS, Kv, Faer), and\nsimulates past climate when driven by historical forcings. To average over the internal variability in MESM,\neach model simulation is taken as the ensemble average of a four-member initial condition ensemble. We\nevaluate the likelihood of a given model run by comparing the model output to time series of observed\nclimate change. In particular, we use the decadal mean time series of surface temperature anomalies in four\nequal-area zonal bands from 1941 to 2010 with respect to a 1906\u20131995 climatology and the linear trend in\nthe 0- to 2,000-m global mean ocean heat content change between 1991 and 2010 as diagnostics.\nWe note here that the dates used in the ocean heat content diagnostic represent a change from our pre-\nvious work (Libardoni et al., 2018a, 2018b), where data from 1955 to 2010 are used to estimate the linear\ntrend.We have implemented this change for two reasons. First, including only recent data uses the observed\naccelerated warming of the ocean (Gleckler et al., 2016) as a constraint on model performance. Second,\nimprovements to the ocean monitoring system have decreased the uncertainty in estimates of global mean\nocean heat content in recent years (Levitus et al., 2012).\nFor each diagnostic, we calculate a goodness-of-fit statistic, r2, as the weighted sum-of-squared residuals\nbetween model output and observations. Mathematically, r2 is expressed as\nr2 = (x(\ud835\udf03) \u2212 y)TC\u2212 1N (x(\ud835\udf03) \u2212 y), (1)\nwhere x(\ud835\udf03) is the vector of model output for a set of model parameters, y is the vector of observed data, and\nC\u22121N is the inverse of the noise-covariance matrix. In our method, C\u22121N represents the temperature patterns\nwe would expect in the model diagnostics in the absence of external forcing and observational noise. The\nobservations andmodel output are projected onto the internal variability patterns, with the weight assigned\nto each element of the residual vector inversely proportional to the size of the deviations expected in the\nunforced climate. Here, the internal variability patterns are determined through an eigendecomposition\nof C\u22121N and the weights are proportional to the inverse square root of the corresponding eigenvalues. To\navoid projecting onto patterns with infinite variance (i.e., those with small eigenvalues), we retain only the\nleading 21 eigenvectors. We note that the definition of r2 presented here is different than the coefficient of\ndetermination for evaluating the fit of a linear model. In a linear model, high values of r2 indicate a good\nfit to the model. In our weighted sum, low values of r2 indicate a good fit between the model output and\nthe observations. A more thorough discussion of the goodness-of-fit statistic calculation and its properties\nis provided in Forest et al. (2001) and Libardoni et al. (2018b). From this statistic, the likelihood of a given\nLIBARDONI ET AL. 10,001\nGeophysical Research Letters 10.1029/2019GL082442\nmodel run representing past climate change is calculated and used to derive a joint PDF for the model\nparameters (Lewis, 2013; Libardoni & Forest, 2011).\nWe estimate the unforced variability patterns from the preindustrial control runs of AOGCMs submitted\nto the CMIP5 archive. We choose to use preindustrial control runs for two reasons. First, all forcings are\nfixed at preindustrial levels, allowing the climate system to evolve without influence from external forcings.\nSecond, control runs tend to be long, allowing for many samples of the model diagnostics to be extracted.\nFrom these samples, we are able to calculate a larger statistical sample of the internal variability to better\nestimate the covariance matrix.\nIn recent work (Libardoni et al., 2018a, 2018b), our estimates have used the variability from only onemodel,\nthe Community Climate SystemModel, version 4 (CCSM4; Gent et al., 2011), in the derivation of parameter\ndistributions. All models are approximations of reality and thus have internal variability inconsistent with\nthat of the true climate system.We test the sensitivity of the parameter distributions to the internal variability\nof the climate system by deriving PDFs using internal variability estimates from many different models.\nTo reflect the current state of models across multiple research groups, we choose to use the preindustrial\ncontrol runs from 25 models from the CMIP5 archive. A list of these models is provided in the supporting\ninformation that accompanies this paper.\nFrom each model, we extract multiple estimates of the temperature diagnostics to determine the patterns of\nunforced variability. To treat the monthly mean surface temperature data from the models as if they were\nobservations, we first regrid the model output from its native grid to the 5 \u00d7 5\u25e6 grid of the observations\n(Hansen et al., 2010; Morice et al., 2012; Rohde et al., 2013; Vose et al., 2012). In the regridding process, we\ntake the area-weighted average of all grid boxes in the model grid that fall partially or completely within the\n5 \u00d7 5\u25e6 grid box of the observations. From the 5\u25e6 resolution data, we extract 105-year segments to correspond\nto the 1906\u20132010 period used in the surface temperature diagnostic. The first segment begins in year one of\nthe simulation and we draw subsequent 105-year segments by shifting the start of the segment forward 4\nyears until the final year of a segment is the last year of the simulation. We choose a short offset to increase\nthe number of samples available for calculating the covariance matrix.\nAfter the output is regridded and the segments extracted, we mask the model output using the missing\ndata mask from each of the observational data sets. For each control run segment, the output is masked\nso that the coverage matches that of the observational data set for the length of the time series. We then\ntreat individual segments as if they are observations and calculate the decadal mean temperature anomaly\ntime series. The noise-covariance matrix used in the goodness-of-fit statistic calculation is estimated by\ncalculating the spatial and temporal correlations across all segments from an individual model. Thus, each\nmodel has its ownC\u22121N and eigendecomposition estimated from its internal variability patterns. In this study,\nwe retain the same number of leading eigenvectors (21) for each model.\nWe extract noise estimates of the ocean diagnostic following methods similar to those for the surface data.\nFrom the gridded data and depth field provided in themodel documentation, we calculate the average global\nmean potential temperature in the 0- to 2,000-m layer. We ignore the small differences between potential\ntemperature and temperature observed at these depths. From the globalmean average time series, we extract\n20-year segments corresponding to the 1991\u20132010 ocean diagnostic. We again separate the starting date\nof the samples by 4 years. Before calculating the trend, we convert the mean temperature in the layer to\nocean heat content using the conversion factor 900/0.09 EJ/\u25e6C from Levitus et al. (2012). Because the ocean\ndiagnostic is a single point, namely the linear trend in global mean ocean heat content, C\u22121N simplifies to the\nstandard deviation in the estimate of the slope.\nOnce the PDFs are calculated using the variability estimates derived from each CMIP5 model, we extract\nthe median value of each parameter from its marginal distribution. We run simulations of MESM using\nthese parameter sets to further test the distributions a posteriori. Namely, we distinguishmodels by whether\nthe MESM runs with the median estimates are consistent with observed changes in global mean surface\ntemperature change and/or ocean heat content by comparing long-term trends simulated by themodel with\nthe changes observed in the historical records.\nLIBARDONI ET AL. 10,002\nGeophysical Research Letters 10.1029/2019GL082442\nFigure 1.Marginal probability distribution functions for (a) effective climate sensitivity, (b)\n\u221a\nKv, and (c) Faer derived\nusing variability estimates from each of the 25 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 models. Distributions\nare color coded based on how a model passes or fails the selection tests.\n3. Results\nWe present the probability distributions estimated using the variability estimates from each of the 25 differ-\nent CMIP5 models in Figure 1. As in Libardoni et al. (2018b), we estimate the joint PDF using each of the\nfour surface temperature data sets individually and then merge the estimates by taking the point-by-point\naverage of the four individual joint PDFs. Although not shown here, offline tests show changing to the\nshorter ocean diagnostic described in section 2 leads to lower ECS andKv estimates and have amuch smaller\nimpact on Faer estimates (see supporting information). The main results and conclusions of this study\nare independent of these changes, however. We present the median values of these distributions used to run\nthe additional MESM simulations in Figure 2.\nWe assume that the internal variability of each CMIP5 model is an equally likely representation the climate\nsystem and thus assign equal weight to each PDF estimate, choosing not to judge one model as better than\nany other. For this reason, we have not labeled the individual distributions. However, the distributions are\ncolor coded based on three selection methods that we describe next. For method one, we identify models\nbased on their control run length being longer or shorter than 500 years. As the length of the control run\nincreases, the number of estimates of the diagnostics used to calculate the noise-covariancematrix increases.\nFor the second and third methods, we use the MESM simulations with parameters set to the median values\nfrom each of the marginal distributions shown in Figures 1 and 2. We calculate the difference between the\nLIBARDONI ET AL. 10,003\nGeophysical Research Letters 10.1029/2019GL082442\nFigure 2.Median parameter values extracted from each distribution in Figure 1 for each combination of parameters.\nColors are as in Figure 1.\nglobal mean surface temperature in the last decade of the simulation (2001\u20132010) and the first 20 years of\nthe simulation (1861\u20131880) and compare the difference to the observed climate record (Morice et al., 2012).\nWe have identified models where the absolute value of the difference between the temperature change esti-\nmated from the model and calculated from the observations is less than 0.05 \u25e6C. The overall range of 0.1 \u25e6C\nis slightly wider than the spread in the estimates (0.08 \u25e6C) when the temperature change is calculated using\ndifferent surface temperature data sets for a common period (Hansen et al., 2010; Morice et al., 2012; Rohde\net al., 2013; Vose et al., 2012). Similarly, we have identifiedmodels bywhether the simulated change in global\nmean ocean heat content matches the observed change. A summary of which test each model passes and\nfails can be found in the supporting information.\nAlthough presented without uncertainty estimates, it is clear that the PDFs are sensitive to which CMIP5\nmodel is used to estimate the variability (Figure 1). The sensitivities arise because the patterns of internal\nvariability estimated fromeachCMIP5model are different, and the elements of the x(\ud835\udf03)\u2212y vector project dif-\nferently onto these patterns. Thus, a difference between the observations and model output that is assigned\nlittle weight with the pattern from onemodel may be assigned a large weight with the pattern from a second\nmodel.\nWe present the median parameter values for each PDF to further highlight the sensitivity of the estimates to\nthe internal variability and show the \ud835\udf03s for theMESM simulations used in the separationmethods described\nabove (Figure 2). We find the greatest agreement in the Faer medians. There are no extreme outliers and the\nestimates tend to center between \u22120.3 and \u22120.1 W/m2. Despite the relatively narrow range, it is wider than\nthose found when considering other factors such as which surface temperature data set is used and the end\ndate of the diagnostic (Libardoni & Forest, 2013; Libardoni et al., 2018b). For most of the models, we find\nclimate sensitivity to be centered between 3.0 and 4.0 \u25e6C. However, we do observe variation between the\nindividual estimates and five estimates greater than 4.8 \u25e6C and as high as 8 \u25e6C. We see a similar spread in\nthe marginal distributions of\n\u221a\nKv. While the distributions tend to cluster toward lower values between 1.5\nand 3.2 cm/s1/2, there are two estimates with\n\u221a\nKv greater than 4.0 cm/s1/2.\nWe note that all of the ECS and\n\u221a\nKv median outliers come from distributions where models with less\nthan 500 years of control run data are used to estimate the internal variability. In these cases, the con-\ntrol run simulation is too short to extract enough samples of the model diagnostics to accurately estimate\nthe noise-covariance matrix. To increase the number of samples used to estimate C\u22121N , we pool segments\nLIBARDONI ET AL. 10,004\nGeophysical Research Letters 10.1029/2019GL082442\nFigure 3.Marginal probability distribution functions for effective climate sensitivity (a),\n\u221a\nKv (b), and Faer (c) and\ncumulative distribution function for transient climate response (d) resulting from merging the variability estimates\nacross models with similar characteristics. Groupings are for all models (green), all models with length greater than 500\nyears (blue), all models with median parameters consistent with global mean temperature change (red), and all models\nwith median parameters consistent with global mean temperature change and ocean heat content change (black).\nColors for the merged groups are chosen so that the color of the last test passed before failure matches that from\nFigure 1 (e.g., models that fail all tests are plotted green in Figure 1 and therefore only fit in the \u201call models\u201d group).\nextracted from models with similar length and variability characteristics into a single internal variability\nestimate. From the increased collection of segments, we estimate a noise-covariance matrix and derive an\nadditional PDF using the estimate as if it came from a single model. Similar to the treatment of the indi-\nvidual models, we retain the leading 21 eigenvectors when determining the patterns of internal variability\nfrom the pooled samples.\nFor each of the separation methods discussed previously\u2014length of the control simulation, MESM simula-\ntion with median parameters matching global mean temperature change, and MESM simulation matching\nglobal mean ocean heat content change\u2014we group the diagnostic segments from all models that pass the\ntest into a single, merged pool of estimates. In total, four groupings are evaluated: (1) all models, (2) all\nmodels with a 500-year or greater control run, (3) all models where the median distribution values lead\nto a MESM simulation consistent with the observed global mean temperature change, and (4) all models\nwhere the median parameter simulation is consistent with both the global mean surface temperature and\nocean heat content changes. The models that are included in each grouping are given in the supporting\ninformation and the resulting distributions are shown in Figure 3.\nWe observe a much smaller spread in the parameter estimates when the merged variability estimates are\nused to calculate the noise-covariancematrix compared towhen individual CMIP5models are used. Climate\nsensitivity estimates are nearly independent of the criteria used to pool the variability estimates. Across the\nfour groupings, the 5th and 95th percentiles of the distributions vary between 2.4 and 2.5 and 4.4 and 4.9\n\u25e6C, respectively. The widths of these distributions are similar to the 90% confidence interval of 2.9 to 5.3 \u25e6C\nestimated from the distribution using only theCCSM4 internal variability derived in Libardoni et al. (2018b).\nWe note that similar to the climate sensitivity distributions, the Faer distributions show strong agreement\nregardless of which tests are used to group variability estimates. Unlike with the climate sensitivity and\naerosol distributions, we do not observe the\n\u221a\nKv distributions collapsing toward a single distribution with\nthe different merged variability estimates. We estimate 90% confidence intervals of 0.9\u20133.7, 0.9\u20133.5, 1.1\u20134.7,\nand 1.1\u20134.0 cm/s1/2 when variability from all models, models longer than 500 years, models that pass the\nLIBARDONI ET AL. 10,005\nGeophysical Research Letters 10.1029/2019GL082442\nFigure 4.

We also note longer upper tails in distributions\nwhen merged variability estimates are used compared to the distribution using variability from CCSM4\nalone (1.3\u20133.8 cm/s1/2 90% confidence interval).\nTo complement our estimates of ECS, we also estimate the transient climate response (TCR). As suggested\nin Knutti et al. (2017), TCR is a more relevant metric for predicting temperature change over the next few\ndecades. Following the methods of Libardoni et al. (2018a), we draw a 1,000-member Latin hypercube sam-\nple (McKay et al., 1979) of the model parameters from each of the joint PDFs derived using a single CMIP5\nmodel to estimate the internal variability. We convert each of the ECS-\n\u221a\nKv pairs to TCR using the func-\ntional fit derived in Libardoni et al. (2018a). We show the median and 90% confidence intervals for the\nTCR distributions derived from the variability estimates from each individual model along with the TCR\ndistribution derived using the merged variability estimate including all models in Figure 4. Similar to the\u221a\nKv distributions, the estimates of TCR are sensitive to the model used to estimate the internal variability.\nWhen compared to the transient climate response PDF using only CCSM4 (Libardoni et al., 2018b), using\nthe merged variability across all models broadens the 90% confidence interval from 1.5\u20132.0 to 1.4\u20132.1 \u25e6C.\n4. Conclusions\nIn this study, we show that the internal variability estimate, as used in the likelihood function to weight the\nresiduals between model output and observations, has a strong impact on parameter estimation. By esti-\nmating parameters using internal variability from different individual models, we observe that the posterior\ndistributions are sensitive to the control run data. We have explored several criteria to account for these\ndifferences. In particular, some models have control runs that are too short to extract enough samples of\nvariability to provide a good estimate of the noise-covariance matrix. Combining the variability from mul-\ntiple models provides enough samples for a stable covariance estimate and leads to a convergence of the\ndistributions. Because models are approximations of the real world, we cannot assume that any model will\nexactly simulate the internal variability of the natural world. Model developers make different decisions\nLIBARDONI ET AL. 10,006\nGeophysical Research Letters 10.1029/2019GL082442\nwhen choosing dynamical cores, cloud microphysics schemes, and many other components. These choices\nimpact model behavior, leading to structural uncertainty in the estimation of the patterns of internal vari-\nability. Drawing samples from a singlemodel cannot account for this structural uncertainty and leads to only\none of the many possible representations being used when estimating covariance matrices. Using multiple\nmodels to estimate the internal variability draws samples across the different model structures and better\nrepresents the uncertainty we have in knowing the variability of the natural world. When sampling across\nthis wider range of model structures, we see a broadening of our estimates of model parameters and tran-\nsient climate response. In particular, the constraints on all model parameters and transient climate response\nwhen using the merged estimate of the internal variability across 25 different CMIP5 models were either\nthe same as or narrower than those when using the CCSM4model alone. Given this, we suggest using mul-\ntiple models when estimating the internal variability of the climate system, rather than a longer run of a\nsingle model.\nReferences\nAldrin, M., Holden, M., Guttorp, P., Skeie, R.

Introduction\nThe investigation of the global structural properties plays\na central role in the provision of a unifying picture of the\nclimate system on a large variety of time and space scales, as\nenvisioned by the scientific perspective beautifully presented\nin the landmark book by Saltzman (2002).\nMany authors have approached this problemmainly from\na \u2018deterministic dynamical systems\u2019 point of view, with the\nCopyright c\u00a9 2010 Royal Meteorological Society\nSnowball Earth Hysteresis Experiment 3\nensuing successes due to the discovery of, possibly, general\nmathematical properties \u2013 see, for example, the analysis of\nthe stability of the thermohaline circulation (Rahmstorf,\n1995) \u2013 and the flaws due to the fact that the simplifications\nadopted in the heuristic derivation of the dynamical systems\nsometimes blur out the involved physical processes and\nhardly allow for an efficient representation of the actual\nfluctuations and of the thermodynamics of the system.\nThe introduction of stochastic forcing provides a relatively\nsimple but conceptually rich partial solution to some of\nthese problems, with, anyway, the unavoidable limitation of\nthe need for \u2018closure theory\u2019 \u2013 usually beyond reach \u2013 for\nthe statistical properties of noise. See Fraedrich (1978) and\nSaltzman (2002) for an in-depth discussion of these issues\nin a rather general setting.\nAnother way of addressing the \u2018big picture\u2019 of the climate\nsystem is to adopt a thermodynamic perspective. The\nanalysis of the energy cycle of the atmosphere (Lorenz,\n1955, 1967) highlighted the concept of availability by\nshowing that only a tiny part of the potential energy of\nthe atmosphere can be converted to mechanical energy.\nThe formalization of the concept of efficiency allowed\nfor defining an effective climate machine, driven by the\ntemperature difference between a warm and a cold thermal\npool. Thus, the atmospheric and oceanic motions are at\nthe same time the result of the mechanical work (then\ndissipated in a turbulent cascade) produced by the engine,\nand are processes which re-equilibrate the energy balance\nof the climate system (Lorenz, 1967; Stone, 1978; Peixoto\nand Oort, 1992). A rigorous definition of a Carnot engine-\nequivalent picture of the climate system has been recently\nprovided (Johnson, 1989, 2000) and further expanded. On\na parallel line, a great deal of attention has been paid\nto the application of non-equilibrium thermodynamics to\nthe climate system. The climate can be seen as a non-\nequilibrium system, which generates entropy by irreversible\nprocesses and keeps a steady state by balancing the input\nand output of energy and entropy with the surrounding\nenvironment. Peixoto and Oort (1992) provided a detailed\ntheoretical presentation of the entropy production in the\nclimate system and some reasonable estimates of its value are\ngiven,whereas inOzawa et al. (2003) andKleidonandLorenz\n(2005) a more modern perspective is given. Moreover,\nfollowing the stimulations by Johnson (1997), detailed\nanalyses of spurious entropy generation in dynamical cores\nof climate models have been recently presented (Woollings\nand Thuburn, 2006). Finally, in spite of its debated validity\n(Dewar, 2005; Grinstein and Linsker, 2007), an increasing\npopularity is enjoyed by methods related to the maximum\nentropy production principle (MEPP), first discussed by\nPaltridge (1975).MEPPproposes that anout-of-equilibrium\nnonlinear system adjusts in such a way as to maximize the\nproduction of entropy (Martyushev and Seleznev, 2006).\nFirst applications of theMEPP to general-circulationmodels\n(GCMs) have been provided by Kleidon et al. (2003, 2006)\nand Fraedrich and Lunkeit (2008).\nRecently, a line connecting the investigation of the\nclimate as a thermal engine to the analysis of its\nentropy production has been drawn (Lucarini, 2009).\nWithin the same perspective, in this paper we aim to\nexplore a major palaeoclimatic transition \u2013 namely the\nonset and decay of snowball conditions (Saltzman, 2002).\nFollowing the early stimulation by Kirschvink (1992) and\nthe subsequent indication of the possible occurrence of\nsnowball conditions for our planet in the Neoproterozoic\n(Hoffman et al., 1998), a great deal of attention has been\nplaced upon understanding the conditions under which\nsnowball conditions could be realized and, subsequently,\na reverse transition to a (relatively) ice-free planet could\nbe accomplished (Hoffman and Schrag, 2002). Simplified\nenergy balance models have emphasized that the ice-\nalbedo feedback (Budyko, 1969; Sellers, 1969) and the\nwater-vapour feedback (Fraedrich, 1979) constitute the\nfundamental mechanisms in determining such catastrophic\n(Arnol\u2019d, 1992) climate shifts. With the fast development of\ncomputer modelling and the possibility to take into account\nan increasing body of palaeogeographic information, the\nsimulation of snowball conditions has been extensively\ndiscussed in the climate modelling literature (see e.g.\nDonnadieu et al., 2004). In particular, it has been guessed\nthat, within a certain parametric range, the same irradiance\ncan support both the ice-covered and the ice-free conditions\n(Pierrehumbert, 2004), i.e. the climate system features\nbistability. As it is thought that the recovery from the\nguessed ice-covered state could have been provoked by\na massive increase in CO2 concentration, the impact\nof changes in atmospheric composition on deglaciation\nprocesses has been extensively studied. Nevertheless,\nwhen palaeo-conditions are considered, recent simulations\n(Pierrehumbert, 2005) have found unsatisfactory agreement\nwith estimates obtained with simplified models (Caldeira\nand Kasting, 1992). More recent studies, performed with a\nstate-of-the-art fully coupled climate model with present-\nday boundary conditions, have shown that recovery from\nthe ice-covered state is indeed possible with the injection of\nlarge amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere (Marotzke and\nBotzet, 2007; Voigt andMarotzke, 2009). These studies have\nalso emphasized the role of ocean transports in determining\nthe stability properties of the system.\nIn this paper, rather than trying to answer the specific\nquestion of whether the planet Earth underwent an actual\ncycle of global glaciation/deglaciation, we wish to study,\nusing a simplified yet Earth-like climate model (Planet\nSimulator: Fraedrich et al., 2005a, 2005b), how the macro-\nscale thermodynamics of the climate system changes when\nparametrically controlling the value of the solar constant\nand exploring glaciation/deglaciation transitions. Following\nthe theoretical framework described in Lucarini (2009), we\ncompute the Carnot efficiency, the entropy production and\nthe degree of irreversibility of the climate system for a\nlarge set of simulations representative of climate conditions\nrealized for value of the solar constants ranging between\n90% and 110% of the present value. Therefore, the goal we\npursue is to propose a framework suitable for defining in\na comprehensive way possibly new interpretations of large-\nscale climate processes and of major climate transitions.\nThis has significant relevance also in the context of the ever-\nincreasing attention paid by the scientific community to\nthe quest for reliable metrics to be used in the validation of\nclimatemodels of various degrees of complexity, as discussed\nin, for example, Held (2005), Lucarini et al. (2007a) and\nLucarini (2008). The paper is organized as follows. In section\n2 we recapitulate the theoretical framework considered in\nthis analysis. In section 3 we overview the main features\nof the climate model, the performed simulations, and the\ndata analysis strategies, including some techniques able to\ncircumvent some unavoidable model errors. In section 4 we\nCopyright c\u00a9 2010 Royal Meteorological Society Q. J. R. Meteorol. Soc. 136: 2\u201311 (2010)\n4 V. Lucarini et al.\npresent our main results; in section 5 our conclusions are\ndrawn and perspective future work outlined.\n2. Notes on the non-equilibrium thermodynamics of the\nclimate system\nLet the total energy of the \u0001 domain of the climatic system\nbe given by E(\u0001) = P(\u0001) + K(\u0001), where P represents the\nmoist static potential energy, given by the thermal \u2013 inclusive\nof the contributions due to water phase transitions \u2013 and\npotential contributions, and K is the total kinetic energy.\nThe time derivative of the total kinetic and potential\nenergy can be expressed as K\u02d9 = \u2212D\u02d9 + W\u02d9 , P\u02d9 = \u0002\u02d9 + D\u02d9 \u2212 W\u02d9 ,\nwhere we have dropped \u0001-dependence for convenience,\nD\u02d9 is the (positive definite) integrated dissipation, W\u02d9 is\nthe instantaneous work performed by the system, \u0002\u02d9\nrepresents the heating due to convergence of heat fluxes\n(which can be split into the radiative, sensible, and latent\nheat components), such that E\u02d9 = \u0002\u02d9. We denote the total\nheating rate as \u0003\u02d9 = \u0002\u02d9 + D\u02d9. If we are considering a non-\nequilibrium steady state system (NESS, see Gallavotti, 2006),\nthe quantities E, P, K are stationary (in terms of statistical\nproperties). Therefore E\u02d9 = P\u02d9 = K\u02d9 = 0, where the upper\nbar indicates time averaging over a long time-scale. At any\ninstant,we canpartition thedomain\u0001 into\u0001+ and\u0001\u2212, such\nthat the intensive total heating rate Q\u02d9 = 1/\u03c1(\u03b52 \u2212 \u0002\u2207 \u00b7 H),\ngiven by the sum of viscous dissipation and convergence of\nthe turbulent and radiative heat fluxes H, is positive in \u0001+\nand negative in \u0001\u2212. Therefore:\nP\u02d9 + W\u02d9 =\n\u222b\n\u0001+\ndV \u03c1Q\u02d9+ +\n\u222b\n\u0001\u2212\ndV \u03c1Q\u02d9\u2212 = \u0003\u02d9+ + \u0003\u02d9\u2212 = \u0003\u02d9\n(1)\nwhere the quantities \u0003\u02d9\n+\nand \u0003\u02d9\n\u2212\nare positive and negative at\nall times, respectively. Since dissipation is positive definite,\nwe obtain \u2212K\u02d9 + W\u02d9 = D\u02d9 = P\u02d9 + W\u02d9 = W\u02d9 = \u0003\u02d9+ + \u0003\u02d9\u2212 > 0.\nUsing the second law of thermodynamics, and assuming\nlocal thermodynamic equilibrium \u2013 which applies pretty\nwell everywhere except in the upper atmosphere, which\nhas a negligible mass \u2013 we have locally Q\u02d9 = s\u02d9T, with s\u02d9 the\ntime derivative of the entropy density. We hereby neglect\nthe contributions to entropy variations due to chemical\nmixing related to salinity fluxes in the ocean (Shimokawa\nand Ozawa, 2001) and due to the mixing of water vapour\nin the atmosphere (Pauluis and Held, 2002); as discussed\nin Lucarini (2009), both terms can be safely neglected. The\nderivative of the entropy of the system is:\nS\u02d9 =\n\u222b\n\u0001+\ndV\n\u03c1Q\u02d9+\nT\n+\n\u222b\n\u0001\u2212\ndV\n\u03c1Q\u02d9\u2212\nT\n=\n\u222b\n\u0001+\ndV \u03c1\n\u2223\u2223s\u02d9+\u2223\u2223\n\u2212\n\u222b\n\u0001\u2212\ndV \u03c1\n\u2223\u2223s\u02d9\u2212\u2223\u2223 = \u0006\u02d9+ + \u0006\u02d9\u2212 (2)\nwhere at all times \u0006\u02d9\n+\n> 0 and \u0006\u02d9\n\u2212\n< 0. Since the system\nis at steady state, S\u02d9 = 0, so that \u0006\u02d9+ = \u2212\u0006\u02d9\u2212. Moreover,\n2\u0006\u02d9\n+ = \u222b\n\u0001\ndV \u03c1|s\u02d9|, so that \u0006\u02d9+ measures the absolute\nvalue of the entropy fluctuations throughout the domain.\nWe obtain that \u0003\u02d9\n+ = \u0006\u02d9+\u0007+ and \u0003\u02d9\u2212 = \u0006\u02d9\u2212\u0007\u2212, where\n\u0007+(\u0007\u2212) is the time and space averaged value of the\ntemperature where absorption (release) of heat occurs.

We then obtain that the climate system can be\nrepresented as a Carnot engine such that W\u02d9 = \u03b7\u0003\u02d9+,\nwhere \u03b7 = (\u0007+ \u2212 \u0007\u2212)/\u0007+ = (\u0003\u02d9+ + \u0003\u02d9\u2212)/\u0003\u02d9\u2212 can be\nrigorously defined as the equivalent Carnot efficiency.\nAs shown in Lorenz (1955) \u2013 and clarified in Johnson\n(2000) \u2013 the long-term average of the work performed by\nthe system is equal to the long-termaverage of the generation\nof available potential energy, which can be interpreted as the\nportion of the total potential energy which is available for\nreversible conversion.\nThe second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy\nvariation of a system at temperature T receiving an amount\nof heat \u03b4Q is larger than or equal to \u03b4Q/T (Landau and\nLifshitz, 1980). In this case we have:\nS\u02d9in(\u0001) \u2265 S\u02d9min(\u0001) =\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\uf8ed\n\u222b\n\u0001\ndV \u03c1Q\u02d9\u222b\n\u0001\ndV \u03c1T\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f8 =\n(\n\u0003\u02d9\n+ + \u0003\u02d9\u2212\n\u3008\u0007\u3009\n)\n\u2248 \u0003\u02d9\n+ + \u0003\u02d9\u2212\n\u3008\u0007\u3009 \u2248\n\u0003\u02d9\n+ + \u0003\u02d9\u2212(\n\u0007+ + \u0007\u2212)/2 =\nW\u02d9(\n\u0007+ + \u0007\u2212)/2 ,\n(3)\nwhere S\u02d9in(\u0001) is the long-term average of the entropy\nproduction inside the system, S\u02d9min(\u0001) is its lower bound,\ni.e. the minimal value of the entropy production compatible\nwith the presence of a Lorenz energy cycle with intensity\nW\u02d9 , \u3008\u0007\u3009, and \u3008\u0007\u3009 is the density-averaged temperature of the\nsystem. The approximation holds as long as we can neglect\nthe impact of the time cross-correlation between the total\nnet heat balance and the average temperature and we can\nassume that \u3008\u0007\u3009 can be approximated by the mean of the\ntwo Carnot temperatures \u0007+ and \u0007\u2212. We can explicitly\nwrite S\u02d9min(\u0001) as:\nS\u02d9min(\u0001) \u2248 W\u02d9(\n\u0007+ + \u0007\u2212)/2 =\n\u03b7\u0003\u02d9\n+\n(\n\u0007+ + \u0007\u2212)/2\n= \u03b7 \u0007\n+(\n\u0007+ + \u0007\u2212)/2 \u0006\u02d9\n+ = \u03b7 1\n1 \u2212 \u03b7/2 \u0006\u02d9\n+ \u2248 \u03b7\u0006\u02d9+ (4)\nwhere the last approximation holds as long as \u03b7 \b 1, which\napplies in the case of the climate system.

Therefore, \u03b7 sets also the scale relating\nthe lower bound to the entropy production of the system\nS\u02d9min(\u0001) \u2013 due to macroscopically irreversible processes \u2013 to\nthe absolute value of the entropy fluctuations inside the\nsystem due to microscopically reversible heating or cooling\nCopyright c\u00a9 2010 Royal Meteorological Society Q.

Note that if the system is isothermal and at\nequilibriumthe internal entropyproduction is zero, since the\nefficiency \u03b7 is vanishing.We can express the averagematerial\nentropy production as S\u02d9in = S\u02d9min + S\u02d9exc, where S\u02d9exc is the\nexcess of entropy production with respect to the minimum,\nwhich results from the heat transport down-gradient the\ntemperature field. We can define:\n\u03b1 \u2248 S\u02d9exc\nS\u02d9min\n\u2248\n\u222b\n\u0001\ndV H \u00b7 \u0002\u2207 ( 1T )\nW\u02d9\n/\n\u3008\u0007\u3009\n\u2265 0 (5)\nas a parameter of irreversibility of the system, which\nis zero if all the production of entropy is due to\nthe \u2013 unavoidable \u2013 viscous dissipation of the mechanical\nenergy. As S\u02d9in \u2248 \u03b7\u0006+(1 + \u03b1), we have that entropy\nproduction is maximized if we have a joint optimization\nof heat transport and of production of mechanical work.\nNote that, if heat transport down-gradient the temperature\nfield is very strong, the efficiency \u03b7 is small because the\ndifference between the temperatures of the warm and the\ncold reservoirs is greatly reduced (the system is almost\nisothermal), whereas, if the transport is very weak, the\nfactor \u03b1 is small. This provides a new way of interpreting\nthe controversial MEPP, and in particular clarifies why\nin Kleidon et al. (2003, 2006) the entropy production\nis maximized when the efficiency of the meridional heat\ntransport is neither too high nor too low.\n3. Data andmethods\n3.1. Model and experimental design\nThe Planet Simulator (PLASIM) is a climate model of inter-\nmediate complexity, freely available at http://www.mi.uni-\nhamburg.de/plasim (Fraedrich et al., 2005a, 2005b). The\nprimitive equations formulated for vorticity, divergence,\ntemperature and the logarithmof surface pressure are solved\nvia the spectral transform method (Eliasen et al., 1970;\nOrszag, 1970). The parametrizations for unresolved pro-\ncesses consist of long (Sasamori, 1968) and short (Lacis and\nHansen, 1974) wave radiation, interactive clouds (Stephens,\n1978; Stephens et al., 1984; Slingo and Slingo, 1991), moist\n(Kuo, 1965, 1974) and dry convection, large-scale precipita-\ntion, boundary-layer fluxes of latent and sensible heat, and\nvertical and horizontal diffusion (Louis, 1979; Louis et al.,\n1982; Laursen and Eliasen, 1989; Roeckner et al., 1992).\nThe land surface scheme uses five diffusive layers for the\ntemperature and a bucket model for the soil hydrology. The\nmodel includes a 50 m mixed-layer (swamp) ocean which\nincludes a 0-dimensional thermodynamic sea-ice model. In\nspite of their obvious limitations, as recently discussed by\nDanabasoglu and Gent (2009), slab ocean climate models\nare well suited for providing an accurate steady-state climate\nresponse.\nIn a previous study (Fraedrich and Lunkeit, 2008)\nPLASIM has been subjected to an analysis of the entropy\nbudget and its sensitivity by directly computing the\ncontribution from each individual process to the total\nentropy production. Compared to that study, one major\nmodification of the model is made. Following Lucarini and\nFraedrich (2009), the global atmospheric energy balance is\ngreatly improved with respect to previous versions of the\nmodel by re-feeding the kinetic energy losses due to surface\nfriction and horizontal and vertical momentum diffusion.\nSee Becker (2003) for an in-depth discussion on these topics.\nPLASIM performs satisfactorily well, as the average energy\nbias is in all simulations smaller than 0.2 W m\u22122, which\nis almost one order of magnitude smaller than most state-\nof-the art climate models (Lucarini and Ragone, 2009).\nThis is done locally by an instantaneous heating of the\nenvironmental air.\nHere, PLASIM is used in the configuration with\nT21 horizontal resolution (approx. 5.6\u25e6 \u00d7 5.6\u25e6 on the\ncorresponding Gaussian grid) with five sigma levels in\nthe vertical. For the present study the usually prescribed\noceanic heat transport is set to zero. A parameter sweep (or\nhysteresis) is performed by changing the solar constant. The\nexperiment consists of 81 simulations: (1) From a present-\nday value (1365 W/m2) the solar constant is gradually\ndecreased by steps of 0.5% of the present-day value (i.e.\n6.825 W/m2) to 1228.5 W/m2 (\u221210%); (2) then it is\ngradually increased to 1501.5 W/m2 (+10% of the present-\nday value); (3) finally, it is gradually decreased again to\nthe present-day value. Each simulation (with a fixed solar\nconstant) has a length of 100 years to ensure that the system\nachieves equilibriumwell before the end of the run. The next\nsimulation (withmodified solar constant) is started from the\nend of the previous one (the first present-day integration is\nstarted from an initial state with an atmosphere at rest).\nThe statistical properties of the observables considered\nin this study are computed on the last 30 years of the\nsimulations in order to rule out the presence of transient\neffects. We consider, in addition to the global, time averaged\nsurface temperature Ts, the following bulk thermodynamic\nobservables: \u0006\u02d9\n+\n, \u0006\u02d9\n\u2212\n, \u0003\u02d9\n\u2212\n, \u0003\u02d9\n+\n(computed as described\nin section 2) and S\u02d9in, computed as described in Ozawa\net al. (2003) and Kunz et al. (2008).\n3.2. Accounting for spurious biases in the model diagnostics\nThe theoretical framework proposed in section 2 needs\nsome amendments in order to be applicable to actual\ndata as it requires a rigorous agreement with the NESS\nhypothesis \u2013 namely, when first moments are considered,\nE\u02d9 = P\u02d9 = K\u02d9 = S\u02d9 = 0. If this condition is not obeyed, the\ndefinition of the efficiency \u03b7, which is central in our\nargumentation, becomes problematic. In spite of the\nimprovements to the energy budget described above,\nPLASIM presents some modest biases in the global energy\nand entropy budgets, due basically to numerical errors\naffecting heating/cooling terms. This is a relatively neglected\ninadequacy common to all climate models, which has been\nthe subject of a recent investigation (Lucarini and Ragone,\n2009) focusing on the energy budget of all the GCMs\nincluded in the Fourth IPCC Assessment Report (IPCC,\n2007). We anticipate that PLASIM budgets are closer to\nzero than those of any state-of-the-art GCM. Moreover, the\npurely \u2018adiabatic\u2019 numerical error in the entropy budget\ndiscussed thoroughly in Johnson (2000) has been estimated\nto be at least one order of magnitude smaller than what is\ndiscussed below, so it will not be further considered.\nLet us assume that themodel errors are relatively small, so\nthat S\u02d9 = \u0006\u02d9+ + \u0006\u02d9\u2212 = \u000bS, with\u000bS \b\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u0006\u02d9+\u2223\u2223\u2223 , \u2223\u2223\u2223\u0006\u02d9\u2212\u2223\u2223\u2223, and that\nE\u02d9 = P\u02d9 + K\u02d9 = \u000bE, with \u000bE \b\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u0003\u02d9+\u2223\u2223\u2223 , \u2223\u2223\u2223\u0003\u02d9\u2212\u2223\u2223\u2223.

Details in the\ntext.\nthat the kinetic energy budget is unbiased \u2013 as actually is\nthe case \u2013 we have P\u02d9 = \u000bE = \u0003\u02d9 \u2212 W\u02d9 = \u0003\u02d9\n+ + \u0003\u02d9\u2212 \u2212 W\u02d9 .\nTherefore, W\u02d9 = \u0003\u02d9+ + \u0003\u02d9\u2212 \u2212 \u000bE, and we can simply define\nW\u02d9 = \u03b7E\u0003\u02d9\n+\nwith \u03b7E =\n(\n\u0003\u02d9\n+ + \u0003\u02d9\u2212 \u2212 \u000bE\n)/\n\u0003\u02d9\n+\n. Note that\nsince \u000bE can be comparable to the algebraic sum of \u0003\u02d9\n+\nand\n\u0003\u02d9\n\u2212\n, neglecting the energy bias can cause notable errors in\nthe definition of the efficiency and in the estimate of the\naverage work W\u02d9 .\nIf, instead, we adopt straightforwardly the\ndefinition \u03b7\u0007 =\n(\n\u0007+ \u2212 \u0007\u2212)/\u0007+, and use the\ndefinitions \u0003\u02d9\n+ = \u0006\u02d9+\u0007+ and \u0003\u02d9\u2212 = \u0006\u02d9\u2212\u0007\u2212,\nwe obtain \u03b7\u0007 =\n(\n\u0003\u02d9\n+ \u2212 \u0003\u02d9\u2212\u0006\u02d9\u2212\n/\n\u0006\u02d9\n\u2212)/\n\u0003\u02d9\n+ =(\n\u0003\u02d9\n+ + \u0003\u02d9\u2212 \u2212 \u0003\u02d9\u2212\u000bs\n/\n\u0006\u02d9\n\u2212)/\n\u0003\u02d9\n+\n. Of course, if\n\u000bE = \u000bS = 0, \u03b7E = \u03b7\u0007 = \u03b7. The second law of thermo-\ndynamics imposes that the energy and entropy biases are\nrelated as follows: \u000bE \u2248 \u3008\u0007\u3009\u000bS, with a relative error of\nthe order of \u2248 (\u0007+ \u2212 \u0007\u2212)/\u3008\u0007\u3009 \u2248 \u03b7. Substituting in the\nexpression of \u03b7\u0007, we obtain:\n\u03b7\u0007 \u2248\n(\n\u0003\u02d9\n+ + \u0003\u02d9\u2212 \u2212 \u000bE\u0007\u2212\n/\n\u3008\u0007\u3009\n)/\n\u0003\u02d9\n+\n\u2248\n(\n\u0003\u02d9\n+ + \u0003\u02d9\u2212 \u2212 \u000bE\n)/\n\u0003\u02d9\n+ = \u03b7E. (6)\nWithin a correction of the order of \u03b7\u00072, the two\ndefinitions of efficiency are consistent. Therefore, the\nformula \u03b7\u0007 =\n(\n\u0007+ \u2212 \u0007\u2212)/\u0007+ can be used also in the\ncase of a climate model featuring biases in the energy and\nentropy budgets without explicit need to diagnose \u000bE and\n\u000b\u0007. For all the simulations described in section 3.1 we have\nverified that \u000bE and \u000bS are small and related up to a high\ndegree of approximation as described above.\n4. Results\nAs a first step, we have analysed the dependence of the global\naverage surface temperature Ts with respect to the solar\nconstant S\u2217, in order to have a clear view of the large-scale\nsimulated climate conditions using as indicator the most\ncommonly used benchmark variable in climate studies. For\nthe present value S\u2217 = 1360 Wm\u22122, we have as output\nTs = 287.15K, which, given the simplification involved in\nthe PLASIM structure, is quite satisfactory. As shown in\nFigure 1, for a large range of values of the solar constant\nwe foresee two possible distinct climatic steady states, which\ncan be first characterized by a large difference \u2013 of the\norder of 40\u201350 K \u2013 in the value of Ts. Correspondingly, the\nsystem features two distinct branches, which correspond to\nthe warm (W) \u2013 which the present climate belongs to \u2013 and\nthe snowball (SB) climate conditions. In all figures, the W\nbranch is depicted with a thin line, whereas the SB branch is\ndepicted with a thick line.\nIn the SB regime, the planet is characterized by a very cold\nclimate corresponding to a greatly enhanced albedo due to\nthe massive ice-cover. In our actual integration, we start\nfrom present climate conditions, decrease the value of S\u2217\nand observe a sharp W \u2192 SB transition, corresponding to\na bifurcation, occurring at S\u2217 \u2248 1263 Wm\u22122 \u2261 SWSB\u2217 . The\nvalue of the reduction of solar constant needed to induce\nthe onset of snowball conditions basically agrees with that\nfound by Poulsen and Jacob (2004) and by Voigt and\nMarotzke (2009); see also Wetherald and Manabe (1975,\nFig. 5). The SB steady state is realized for values of the solar\nconstant up to S\u2217 \u2248 1433Wm\u22122 \u2261 SSBW\u2217 , where the reverse\nSB \u2192 W transition, with the corresponding bifurcation,\nis realized. Therefore, again in agreement with Voigt and\nMarotzke (2009), the present solar irradiance supports two\nrather distinct climatic states. These bifurcations correspond\nto the condition when the ice-albedo positive feedback is\nstrong enough to destabilize the system. In Figure 1 the\nleft-pointing triangle describes the transition W \u2192 SB, the\nright-pointing triangle indicates the SB \u2192 W transition.\nMoreover, the W branch is indicated with a thin solid\nline, the SB branch in indicated with a thick solid line,\nwhereas the transitions are depicted with dashed lines.\nWe will use this convention throughout the paper. As\nexpected in both SB and W conditions Ts monotonically\nincreases with S\u2217, because the system has an input of\nlarger amounts of energy. Far from the unstable region,\nwe observe an extended quasi-linear regime with a constant\nsensitivity of dT\u00afs/dS\u2217 \u2248 0.1 K\n/ (\nW m\u22122\n)\nin the W and\ndT\u00afs/dS\u2217 \u2248 0.07 K\n/(\nWm\u22122\n)\nin the SB branch, respectively.\nInstead, as typical when stability is lost, the sensitivity\nincreases when the bifurcation is approached.\nAt this point a mathematical clarification is required. In\nsimple models (e.g. Scott et al., 1999) or, in general, in\nnon-chaotic models (e.g. Lucarini et al., 2007b), bistability\nis typically associated with the presence of two fixed points\nseparated by an unstable equilibrium, and the loss of stability\non an equilibrium is related to a bifurcation determining\nthe change in the sign of one eigenvalue of the linearized\nproblem. In the present case, instead, the two branches\ndefine the presence of two parametrically modulated (by\nthe changes in the value of the solar constant) families\nof disjoint strange attractors, as in each climate state the\ndynamics of the system is definitely chaotic, as shown by\nthe fact that, for example, the system features variability on\nall time-scales. This corresponds, in Lorenz\u2019s terminology,\nto having intransitive climate conditions (Lorenz, 1967;\nPeixoto and Oort, 1992). The loss of stability realized\nin the W \u2192 SB and SB \u2192 W transitions is related to\nthe catastrophic disappearance of one of the two strange\nattractors, resulting from complicated bifurcations. In this\ncase, transitive climate conditions are realized. Near the\nCopyright c\u00a9 2010 Royal Meteorological Society Q. J. R. Meteorol.

Global work\nWe next investigate the time-averaged global work,\ncomputed as W\u02d9 = \u0003\u02d9+ + \u0003\u02d9\u2212 \u2212 \u000bE, which results in\nproduction of kinetic energy, eventually dissipated by\nviscous dissipation. Notably (Figure 2(a)), the work\ndecreases with increasing solar constant in W climate\nconditions (with plateaus at both ends). This is in agreement\nwith the recent findings of Herna\u00b4ndez-Deckers and von\nStorch (2009), who observed in a fully coupled GCM a\ndecrease in the amount of kinetic energy production in a\nwarmer climate with increased CO2 concentrations. Note\nthat smaller values of W\u02d9 imply smaller values of dissipation,\nwhich in turn imply a smaller intensity of surface winds. As\nopposed to that, in SB conditions the time-averaged global\nwork increases with S\u2217, thus implying that a warmer climate\nis accompanied with enhanced generation of kinetic energy\nand stronger dissipation. This constitutes a very important\ndifference between the W and SB climate conditions, which\nwe will further explore below. As a further result of this\ndiscrepancy, we have that the jump in the value of W\u02d9 in the\nW \u2192 SB transition is much larger than that in the SB \u2192 W\ntransition.\nMoreover, as for the surface temperature, in a relatively\nlarge parametric range W\u02d9 is approximately linear with S\u2217.\nWe can then robustly define the sensitivity of the kinetic\nenergy production with respect to the solar constant, with\nresulting values of dW\u02d9\n/\ndS\u2217 \u2248 \u22121.5 \u00b7 10\u22123 in the W and\ndW\u02d9\n/\ndS\u2217 \u2248 1.5 \u00b7 10\u22123 in the SB climate regime.\n1200 1250 1300 1350 1400 1450 1500 1550\n0.015\n0.01\n0.02\n0.025\n0.03\n0.035\n0.04\n0.045(a)\n(b)\nS\n*\n(Wm\u22122)\nWarm Climate\nSnow Ball Climate\nPresent Climate\nW-SB Transition\nSB-W Transition\n220 230 240 250 260 270 280 290 300 310\n0.015\n0.01\n0.02\n0.025\n0.03\n0.035\n0.04\n0.045\nWarm Climate\nSnow Ball Climate\nPresent Climate\nW-SB Transition\nSB-W Transition\nTs(K)\nh\nh\nFigure 3. Time average of the thermodynamic efficiency \u03b7 (time and global\naveraged fraction of absorbed heat Q1 converted into kinetic energy). In\n(a), \u03b7 is plotted against the solar constant, in (b) it is plotted against surface\ntemperature.\nSince Ts is monotonically increasing with respect to\nS\u2217 in both the W and SB branches, we can plot W\u02d9 as\na function of Ts (Figure 2(b)). W\u02d9 is almost perfectly\nlinear with respect to Ts in the SB regime, whereas in\nthe W regime linearity is restricted within 20 K around\nthe present climate conditions. Such a graphical/functional\nrepresentation could be especially useful for developing\nsimplified parametrizations to be used in minimal models.\n4.2. Efficiency\nWhat is observed in Figure 2(a)\u2013(b) is made clearer when\nconsidering the thermodynamic efficiency \u03b7 of the system.\nAs thoroughly analysed in section 3, the expression \u03b7\u0007\nis valid also in the presence of small energy and entropy\nbiases, so we have adopted it in the actual computations\nof the efficiency in this paper. Figure 3(a) shows that the\nthermodynamic efficiency of the present climate is about\n0.025 and all the analysed climate states considered in this\ncontext feature an efficiency ranging between 0.01 and 0.045.\nNote that the range of variation of work (Figure 2) is about\nhalf of that of \u03b7 because of the (partially) compensating\nvariation of \u0003\u02d9\n+\n, which is higher in W than in SB conditions\nand increases monotonically with Ts and S\u2217.\nThe efficiency decreases with a marked linear behaviour\nwith increasing solar constant in W conditions, whereas the\nbehaviour is opposite in SB conditions. We can estimate\nthe linear sensitivities as d\u03b7\n/\ndS\u2217 \u2248 4 \u00b7 10\u22125 W\u22121m2 and\nd\u03b7\n/\ndS\u2217 \u2248 \u22121.6 \u00b7 10\u22124 W\u22121m2 for the SB and W climate\nregimes, respectively.\nSuch a discrepancy in the response of the fundamental\nproperty of the Carnot engine of the climate system defines,\nCopyright c\u00a9 2010 Royal Meteorological Society Q. J. R. Meteorol. Soc. 136: 2\u201311 (2010)\n8 V. Lucarini et al.\nin terms of the second law of thermodynamics, a crucial\ndifference between the SB and W regimes. The fact that the\nincreases in S\u2217 improve the efficiency of the climate engine\nin the SB regime and decrease it in the W regime can be\ninterpreted as follows.\nIn the SB regime the main effect of increases in S\u2217 is\nfavouring the melting of larger portions of the low latitudes,\nwith the resulting increase of the meridional temperature\ngradient due to the strongmeridional albedo contrast, which\nleads to a more efficient \u2013 in terms of Carnot \u2013 climate\nmachine. Instead, in the W regime, increases in the solar\nconstant, thanks to the Clausius\u2013Clapeyron effect (made\nintense by a warm background temperature), cause relevant\nenhancements in the efficacy of the turbulent latent heat\nfluxes, which tend to flatten the temperature gradients and\nimpact negatively on the thermodynamic efficiency of the\nsystem. In other terms: the warmer, the more isothermal in\nthe W regime; the colder, the more isothermal in the SB\nregime (Figure 3(b)).\nMoreover, we wish to underline that the crossing of the\nthin and thick curves as observed in Figure 3(a) implies that\nthe efficiency decreases in both the W \u2192 SB and SB \u2192 W\ntransitions. Since, as discussed in section 3, a larger value of\n\u03b7 corresponds to a state more distant from equilibrium, this\nproperty agrees nicely with the fact that at the bifurcation\nthe system make a transition to a more stable state.\nNote also that, since the fractional variation of \u00071\nas a function of the solar constant, being analogous of\nthat of the surface temperature (see Figure 1), is much\nsmaller than that of \u03b7, Figure 3(a) and (b) look almost\nidentical to corresponding plots of \u00071 \u2212 \u00072 (not shown),\nwith \u03b7 = 0.02 corresponding roughly to \u00071 \u2212 \u00072 = 5K.\nTherefore, in the present climate we have \u00071 \u2212 \u00072 \u2248 6K\nand spanned over the whole range goes from\u00071 \u2212 \u00072 \u2248 3K\nto \u00071 \u2212 \u00072 \u2248 11K. These numbers are always much\nsmaller \u2013 by a factor of 5 or so \u2013 than the observed\ntemperature difference between high and low latitudes\nwhich, therefore, are not reliable for providing an estimate\nof the climate efficiency.\n4.3. Entropy production\nWe next analyse the material entropy production as\ndescribed in Ozawa et al. (2003) and explicitly computed\nin Fraedrich and Lunkeit (2008) for PLASIM. Results are\nshown in Figure 4(a)\u2013(b). The entropy production in both\nthe W and SB branches monotonically increases with the\nsolar constant, with an extended range of linear behaviour.\nIn particular, we can define linear sensitivities whose values\nare dS\u02d9in\n/\ndS\u2217 \u2248 4 \u00b7 10\u22124K\u22121 and dS\u02d9in\n/\ndS\u2217 \u2248 1.5 \u00b7 10\u22124K\u22121\nin theW and SB regime, respectively. For a given value of the\nsolar constant, the entropyproduction in theWstate is larger\nby a factor of about 4, and awide gap exists between the range\nof the S\u02d9in values in the W and in the SB regimes. Therefore,\nS\u02d9in is a very well defined \u2018state variable\u2019 of the climate system\nand seems to provide amore robust qualitative classification\nof the overall climate state than the surface temperature, and,\nin this sense, useful threshold values could be devised.When\nplotted against the surface temperature, thematerial entropy\nproduction is monotonically increasing with obviously a\nmarked quasi-linear behaviour in both branches, so that\nsimple parametrizations can be envisaged to be used in\nconceptual climate models.\n4.4. Irreversibility\nThe last step in the analysis of the \u2018second law\u2019 properties\nof the system is to observe the behaviour of the factor \u03b1,\nwhich, as described in section 3, determines the degree\nof irreversibility of the system, The factor \u03b1 = 0 when no\nheat transport (via radiation or turbulent fluxes) occurs\ndown-gradient the temperature field. In this case, the only\nirreversible process is the unavoidable viscous dissipation\nof kinetic energy. Large values of \u03b1 correspond to a \u2018very\nirreversible\u2019 system. In the SB branch, \u03b1 is small (<1), with\na very weak quasi-linear dependence on S\u2217, such that we can\nestimate d\u03b1\n/\ndS\u2217 \u2248 10\u22123 W\u22121m2. In theW branch, instead,\nthe observed values of \u03b1 are much higher and feature a fast\nincrease with S\u2217, with a marked linear behaviour around the\npresent climate conditionswith d\u03b1\n/\ndS\u2217 \u2248 3 \u00b7 10\u22122 W\u22121m2.\nIn the upper range of S\u2217 values, the increase becomes super-\nlinear. This clearly points to the role of the latent heat fluxes,\nwhose strength depends exponentially on the temperature\nof the system, consistent \u2013 but from a different point of\nview \u2013 with what is observed regarding the decrease in the\nefficiency of the system (Figure 3).\n5. Conclusions\nFor about twenty years nonlinear dynamics tools, which\nare based on the scaling properties of local time series,\nhave supplemented the traditional climate data analysis.\nThese methods provide information on predictability, long-\nterm memory and extremes. Here we introduce a set of\nnovel diagnostic quantities, which are based on the laws of\nthermodynamics, to characterize global properties of climate\nsystem dynamics. These methods provide information on\nefficiency, entropy production, and irreversibility. Using\nthis set of diagnostic tools derived from fundamental laws\nof physics based on non-equilibrium thermodynamics, we\nhave analysed the warm (W) and snowball (SB) Earth\nclimate regimes of a general circulation model to identify\nsome crucial differences between these regimes. From a basic\npoint of view, this diagnostics characterizes features of the\nmacro-state of the climate system. While the W and SB\nregimes agree, as expected, in featuring a positive response\nof surface temperature to increases in the solar constant,\ntheir behaviour is opposite when looking at the dependence\nof the efficiency and of the irreversibility.\nIn the SB regime, increases in the solar constant lead\nto increases in the work performed by the system and\nwith the ensuing dissipation (Figure 2); this is due to an\nenhancement of the efficiency of the system (Figure 3),made\npossible by strong meridional albedo gradients on the top\nof increases in the heat absorption. The material entropy\nproduction increases with the solar constant (Figure 4),\nwith a dominating contribution given by the unavoidable\nviscous-driven dissipation for all values considered of the\nsolar constant. The portion of entropy production due\nto irreversible heat transport processes is almost constant,\nwhich implies that the material entropy production scales\nlinearly with the total dissipation (and the total work) of the\nsystem.\nIn the W regime, higher values of the solar constant lead\nto decreases in the work performed by the system (Figure 2),\nwhich, together with the increases in the heat absorption,\nleads to a dramatic decrease of the efficiency (Figure 3).\nThis corresponds to the fact that the system becomes almost\nCopyright c\u00a9 2010 Royal Meteorological Society Q.

The ensuing decrease\nin the entropy production due to viscous dissipation is\nmore than compensated by the large increase in the\nentropy production related to irreversible heat transport\ndown-gradient the temperature field, deriving from the\ntemperature-driven enhancement in the latent hear fluxes.\nTherefore, the material entropy production of the system is\ngreatly enhancedby increases in the solar constant (Figure4),\nand the degree of irreversibility, measured by the ratio\nbetween the excess of entropy production and the lower\nbound to the material entropy production determined by\nthe second law of thermodynamics, increases very rapidly\n(Figure 5). The fact that, in the warm climate regime,\nchanges in the intensity of latent heat fluxes are crucial\nfor determining macro-scale thermodynamic properties\nsubstantiates the importance of addressing correctly the\nvariations of the hydrological cycle in a changing climate.\nAll of the diagnostics considered feature, in both the\nSB and W regimes, smooth dependence with respect to\nthe solar constant, with extended regions where linear\nfits provide rather good approximations. This suggests\nthe possibility of developing parametrization schemes (e.g.\nvariables expressed as functions of the surface temperature)\nto be adopted in conceptual and intermediate-complexity\nmodels or for the reconstruction of past climate conditions.\nThe transitions between the W and the SB regime (both\nways) are characterized by a decrease in the efficiency of the\nsystem. Since a larger value of \u03b7 corresponds to a state more\ndistant from equilibrium, this property agrees conceptually\nwith the fact that, at the bifurcations, the system makes\na transition from an unstable to a stable state. Moreover,\nsince a larger efficiency is related to the presence of larger\nfluctuations of the climate state, macro-scale destabilizing\nmechanisms are more easily triggered.\nWell within the parametric region where two distinct\nstationary states are detected, instead, if we accept the\nCopyright c\u00a9 2010 Royal Meteorological Society Q.

Lucarini et al.\nprinciple that states with higher entropy production are\nmore probable (Kleidon and Lorenz, 2005), we may\nconclude that it is in general more likely to find the system\nin the W rather than in the SB condition. This stimulating\nhypothesis agrees with the climate conditions observed in\nthe planet in the last hundreds of millions of years.\nOur analysis may provide tools for understanding, apart\nfrom the specific problem of snowball Earth conditions\ninception/decay, the processes involved in the determination\nof the so-called climate \u2018tipping points\u2019, i.e. the conditions\nunder which catastrophic changes may occur for small\nvariations in the boundary conditions or in the internal\nparameters of the system. In this sense, we plan to investigate\nusing the tools described here the impacts of very large\nchanges in the CO2 concentration, and we want to explore\nwhether new insights on the processes controlling the\nrunaway greenhouse effect can be attained. Of course, in\norder to have a more realistic and quantitative picture\nof all the processes involved in the Earth system, the\nadoption of more advanced modelling tools is required.\nIn particular, a better representation of the ocean dynamics\nwould constitute a crucial improvement, considering that\nthe ocean basically provides the bulk of the climate\nsignal on multi-decadal time-scales. The computationally\nproblematic side of adopting a more realistic representation\nis not only that fully coupled atmosphere\u2013ocean models\nare more demanding in terms of computer power per se,\nbut also that, by possessing longer internal time-scales, the\nnumber of years of simulation required for realizing a good\nrepresentation of the steady-state statistical properties is\nhigher than in the case analysed here.\nNevertheless, lower-complexity models can be of\nextraordinary importance fordevisingGedankenexperimente\nand for providing guidance in the definition of specific\ncrucial experiments to be performed with more complex\nmodels.\nOur results support the adoption of a new generation\nof diagnostic tools for auditing climate models of any\nlevel of complexity (Held, 2005; Lucarini et al., 2007a;\nLucarini, 2008).Wemaintain that the adoption ofmetrics of\nvalidation based on the second law of thermodynamics will\ncontribute to improving dramatically the ability of current\nclimate models in representing the global thermodynamical\nproperties of the climate system. Future work in this\ndirection includes the analysis of the impact of CO2 increase\non the thermodynamic properties of the system, and the\ncomputation of the entropy production in state-of-the-art\nclimate models, to be estimated, following the suggestion by\nOzawa et al. (2003), by using radiation budgets at the top of\nthe atmosphere.\nAcknowledgements\nWe appreciate referees\u2019 comments that helped improving\nthe manuscript, X.

Introduction\n[2] The Southern Ocean plays a key role in regulating\nthe Earth\u2019s climate: it connects the three main ocean basins,\ntransporting heat and carbon [S\u00e9f\u00e9rian et al., 2012], and its\nsea ice greatly affects the planetary albedo. Bottom water\nformed in the Southern Ocean circulates worldwide [Orsi\net al., 1999].\n[3] Numerous global climate models (GCMs), with dif-\nferent parameterizations, resolutions and structure, are being\nused by scientists worldwide to estimate the likely climate\nin 50\u2013100 years (e.g., global temperature increase or sea\nlevel rise). The ability of a model to adequately depict bot-\ntom water formation is crucial for accurate prediction of\nchanges in the thermohaline circulation [Hay, 1993]. In the\nreal ocean, Antarctic Bottom Water usually forms when\ncold dense water spills off the shelf [Orsi et al., 1999]\nand then spreads northwards. This process is particularly\nchallenging to represent in the current generation of cli-\nmate models. There have also been episodes of open ocean\ndeep convection, mostly observed in the Weddell Sea in\nAdditional supporting information may be found in the online version\nof this article.\n1School of Environmental Sciences, University of East Anglia,\nNorwich, UK.\n2School of Mathematics, University of East Anglia, Norwich, UK.\n3Met Of\ufb01ce Hadley Centre, Exeter, UK.\nCorresponding author: C.

Here, we assess how dense\nwater is formed in climate models, and how this impacts the\nrepresentation of ocean properties at the sea bed.\n[4] The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase\n5 (CMIP5) project [Taylor et al., 2012] facilitates assess-\nment of the models\u2019 ability to depict the present observed\nstate of the climate system, a prerequisite for reliable future\nprediction. Southern Ocean observational data coverage has\ndramatically increased over recent decades, particularly in\nthe ice-free regions, enabling a detailed analysis of climate\nmodel simulations of this key region. The last generation of\nmodels in CMIP3 poorly represented Southern Ocean trans-\nport and heat \ufb02uxes [Russell et al., 2006]. Subantarctic Mode\nWater and Antarctic Intermediate Water layer thicknesses\nand northward extensions were too small, despite a reason-\nably accurate depiction of temperature and salinity [Sloyan\nand Kamenkovich, 2007]. To our knowledge, there has been\nno assessment of Antarctic Bottom Water in CMIP3 models.\nHere, we evaluate bottom water properties in the Southern\nOcean in CMIP5 models.\n2. Methodology\n[5] We assess Southern Ocean potential temperature,\nsalinity, density and sea ice concentration in 15 CMIP5\nhistorical simulations (means of the 20 August monthly\nmean \ufb01elds from 1986 to 2005, of the \ufb01rst ensemble\nmember, designated r1i1p1 in PCMDI terminology).\nThe models include a hybrid/isopycnal model: GFDL-\nESM2G [Dunne et al., 2012], available through CMIP5 on\nz-level coordinates, and three \u0002-coordinate models:\nINMCM4 [Volodin et al., 2010] requiring conversion to\nz-coordinates, MIROC4h [Sakamoto et al., 2012] and\nMIROC-ESM-CHEM [Watanabe et al., 2011], both avail-\nable converted to z-level coordinates. The remaining 11 are\ntraditional z-level models: CanESM2 [Chylek et al., 2011],\nCNRM-CM5 [Voldoire et al., 2011], CSIRO-Mk3-6-0\n[Gordon et al., 2010], GFDL-ESM2M [Dunne et al., 2012],\nGISS-E2-R [Schmidt et al., 2006], HadGEM2-ES [Jones\net al., 2011], HiGEM [Shaffrey et al., 2009], IPSL-CM5A-\nLR [Dufresne et al., in revision], MPI-ESM-LR [Jungclaus\net al., 2010], MRI-CGCM3 [Yukimoto et al., 2011] and\nNorESM1-M [Tjiputra et al., 2012].\n[6] The 20 year mean model \ufb01elds are compared with his-\ntorical hydrographic data on a grid spacing of 0.5\u0131 \u0002 0.5\u0131\n[Gouretski and Koltermann, 2004], and with the Hadley\nCentre sea ice climatologies [Rayner et al., 2003]. The\nmodel \ufb01elds have all been interpolated to the same grid as\nthe hydrographic climatology, and the climatological values\nsubtracted from the model \ufb01elds to provide difference maps.\nFor each model, we calculate the area-weighted root mean\nsquare (RMS) difference from the climatology of the diag-\nnostic \ufb01elds at all depths (similar results were obtained for\ndifferent depth ranges); in the absence of relevant uncer-\n1409\nHEUZE ET AL.: AABW IN CMIP5\ntainty measurements for the climatological \ufb01elds, the model\nwill be considered as accurate if for each parameter, its RMS\ndifference is smaller than the mean RMS difference of the\n15 models.\n[7] The hydrographic climatology is biased towards sum-\nmer observations, but this does not affect our results since\nbottom properties are seasonally decoupled from the sur-\nface. To estimate the climatological mixed-layer values in\nwinter, we assume that the properties of the subsurface\ntemperature minimum (Winter Water) represent the temper-\nature and salinity that the mixed-layer would have had the\nprevious winter.\n[8] For all models, we calculate potential density rela-\ntive to 2000 m (\u00022) and relative to the surface (\u0002\u0002 ) using\nthe equation of state EOS80 [Fofonoff and Millard, 1983].\nSalinities are quoted on the practical salinity scale and so\nhave no units. We analyze the properties at the deepest grid\ncell during the August mean, when sea ice extent is great-\nest and deep water forms. In considering the replenishment\nof deep water, we determine for each grid point for each\nAugust throughout the 20 years of the study, the maximum\nof the mixed-layer depth (MLD) using a density \u0002\u0002 thresh-\nold of 0.03 kg m\u20133 from the 10 m depth value (as de\ufb01ned\nby de Boyer Mont\u00e9gut et al. [2004]). The same technique is\nused for the climatology, using the Winter Water density as\nthe 10 m value. To show the percentage of the water col-\numn that is well-mixed, we present the MLD divided by\nthe water depth at each point. A value close to 100% indi-\ncates areas where deep convection occurs. We do not use\nthe mixing parameters mlotst and omlmax, which are some\nof the recommended CMIP5 outputs, because they are not\navailable for all the models. We prefer using a consistent\nde\ufb01nition for all models and the climatology. We also found\nthat the CMIP5-recommended globally applied threshold of\n0.125 kg m\u20133 was too high to correctly determine MLD in\nthe relatively unstrati\ufb01ed Southern Ocean. Salinity is not\nshown, but whether each model is too salty or too fresh can\nbe deduced from considering the temperature and density\nmaps together, since density depends on both temperature\nand salinity.\n3. Results\n[9] The RMS differences from the climatology for bot-\ntom temperature and density for each model are indicated\non Figures 1 and 2, respectively. They can also be found in\nTable S1 (in the Auxiliary Material) along with the RMS dif-\nferences for salinity, the area-weighted mean differences for\neach parameter, and the 20 year trends that we discuss at the\nend of this section.\n[10] Bottom temperature in the whole deep Southern\nOcean in locations deeper than 1000 m for CNRM-CM5\n(Figure 1c), GFDL-ESM2M (Figure 1e), MPI-ESM-LR\n(Figure 1j), MRI-CGCM3 (Figure 1k) and MIROC4h\n(Figure 1o) is on average about 1\u0131C warmer than the clima-\ntology. As their salinity \ufb01elds (not shown) are within 0.05\nof the climatological value in the same area and therefore do\nnot dominate the density difference, they are less dense than\nthe climatology by on average 0.15 kg m\u20133 (Figures 2c, 2e,\n2j, 2k and 2o). In contrast, GFDL-ESM2G (Figure 1m) and\nINMCM4 (Figure 1n) are more than 0.5\u0131C colder than the\nclimatology on average for locations deeper than 1000 m in\nthe Southern Ocean. The largest difference is encountered\nin the Paci\ufb01c sector for INMCM4 (1.4\u0131C colder) and in the\nAtlantic for GFDL-ESM2G (0.8\u0131C colder). GFDL-ESM2G\nis also fresher than the climatology in the whole area\n(by 0.1), hence, its density is within 0.05 kg m\u20133 of the cli-\nmatology on average in the Southern Ocean (Figure 2m).\nHowever, the deep waters of INMCM4 are 0.7 saltier across\nthe entire deep Southern Ocean, and so 0.7 kg m\u20133 denser in\nthis area (Figure 2m). CanESM2 (Figure 1b) and MIROC-\nESM-CHEM (Figure 1p) temperatures lie within 0.2\u0131C of\nthe climatology, but are on average 0.2 saltier, so they\nare 0.15 kg m\u20133 denser than the climatology (Figures 2b\nand 2p), consistent with the dominant effect of the salin-\nity. GISS-E2-R (Figure 1f) is on average within 0.5\u0131C of\nthe climatological values, but its temperature RMS differ-\nence is greater (1.24\u0131C) because of the meridional gradi-\nent in temperature: the model displays a 6\u0131C difference\nbetween the subtropics (50\u0131S) and the Antarctic waters\n(80\u0131S), whereas the climatology displays a maximum of\n3.5\u0131C difference over the same latitude range. The same\nphenomenon is observed for GISS-E2-R\u2019s salinity and den-\nsity (Figure 2f). For locations deeper than 1000 m in the\nSouthern Ocean, CSIRO-Mk3-6-0 (Figure 1d), HadGEM2-\nES (Figure 1g), HiGEM (Figure 1h), IPSL-CM5A-LR\n(Figure 1i) and NorESM1-M (Figure 1l) are within 0.5\u0131C\nand 0.1 in salinity, and is within 0.05 kg m\u20133 of the observed\nclimatology (Figures 2d, 2g, 2h, 2i and 2l).\n[11] We now consider if the source of the dense bottom\nwater could originate from dense shelf water (Figure 2). Bot-\ntom density maps are not shown, but shelf production can\nbe seen where areas of deep convection (inside the black\ncontour) intersect regions shallower than 3000 m (inside\nthe gray contours). Five models produce very little or no\ndense water on the shelf: CNRM-CM5 (Figure 2c), MRI-\nCGCM3 (Figure 2k), NorESM1-M (Figure 2l), MIROC4h\n(Figure 2o) and MIROC-ESM-CHEM (Figure 2p). Mod-\nels have a \ufb01xed freezing point, set to values ranging from\n\u20132.5\u0131C to \u20131.8\u0131C, so the difference between the shelf tem-\nperature and the climatology has an upper limit. The water\nproduced on the shelf is not dense enough in these models,\nbecause it is far too fresh: more than 0.25 fresher than in\nthe deep ocean. No consistent link has been found between\nshelf water density and sea ice extent.\n[12] The other models produce dense water on the\nRoss and Weddell Sea shelves, with enhanced local\ndensities of more than 0.2 kg m\u20133, in agreement with the\nclimatology. However, because of the horizontal/isopycnal\ndiffusion schemes in z-level GCMs, this dense water formed\non the Antarctic shelf mixes horizontally as well as vertically\nat each grid point as it travels down the shelf slope. Longi-\ntudinal sections (not shown) suggest that through enhanced\nmixing, the dense shelf water is unable to maintain its prop-\nerties while sinking and propagating northwards, becoming\nmixed with intermediate waters. None of the models are\nable to form dense bottom water through export from the\ncontinental shelf. Even though one might expect that the\nisopycnal (Figure 2m) or \u0002-coordinate (Figures 2n, 2o and\n2p) models should simulate this process better, we \ufb01nd no\nevidence that these four models are any better at exporting\ndense water from the shelf.\n[13] The climate models in this study generate dense\nbottom water through open ocean deep convection. In\nobservations, this process occurs rarely [Marshall and\nSchott, 1999] and does not penetrate to the sea bed.\n1410\nHEUZE ET AL.: AABW IN CMIP5\nFigure 1.

Thick dashed black line is the mean August sea ice extent (concentration > 15%); thick continuous black line\nis the mean February sea ice extent (concentration > 15%). Numbers indicate the area-weighted root mean square error for\nall depths between the model and the climatology (unit \u0131C); mean RMS = 0.97\u0131C.\nDeep convection is likely to occur in regions where the\nmixed-layer extends deeper than half of the whole water\ncolumn (regions enclosed by the black line on Figure 2).\nThe results are insensitive to the choice of indicator\nfor deep convection. Some models produce dense water\nby strong deep convection over a large area: GFDL-\nESM2M (Figure 2e), GISS-E2-R (Figure 2f) and GFDL-\nESM2G (Figure 2m). HadGEM2-ES (Figure 2g), HiGEM\n(Figure 2h), IPSL-CM5A-LR (Figure 2i) and MPI-ESM-\nLR (Figure 2j) host deep convection in smaller areas\nwithin the Weddell and Ross Gyres, and it is these models,\nwhich compare well against the bottom water properties of\nthe climatology.\n[14] In contrast, CNRM-CM5 (Figure 2c) and MIROC4h\n(Figure 2o) have almost no deep convection, and MRI-\nCGCM3 (Figure 2k) only in the Indian sector but not in\nthe subpolar gyres. These three models develop low-density\nbottom water (and even lower density surface water) which\nis too warm, not even producing dense water on the shelf.\nIt might appear that GFDL-ESM2M (Figure 2e) performs\nsimilarly, with warm low-density bottom water, but unlike\nthe three other models, it hosts deep convection in the\nWeddell Gyre. GFDL-ESM2M also has much less winter\nsea ice than CNRCM-CM5, MRI-CGCM3 and MIROC4h,\nwhich may explain the different convective behavior (as we\nexplain below).\n[15] CanESM2 (Figure 2b), CSIRO-Mk3-6-0 (Figure\n2d), NorESM1-M (Figure 2l), INMCM4 (Figure 2n) and\nMIROC-ESM-CHEM (Figure 2p) do not host deep con-\nvection. They are more saline and/or colder than the\nother models, and therefore denser at the sea bed, so\nthe ocean is too strati\ufb01ed to convect.

In contrast, CSIRO-Mk3-6-0, NorESM1-\nM and MIROC-ESM-CHEM global bottom properties\n(not shown) indicate that brief open ocean deep convec-\ntion episodes occur in the Weddell Sea for these mod-\nels, but a higher temporal resolution than the monthly\nmean output available would be necessary to observe this\nprocess happening.\n[16] Some of the different behaviors in the models\u2019 bot-\ntom water densities can be explained by the models\u2019 repre-\nsentation of the seasonal cycle in sea ice extent (black lines\non Figure 1). GISS-E2-R (Figure 1f) and GFDL-ESM2G\n(Figure 1m) have no sea ice left in February and extensive\ndeep convection areas. These models\u2019 sea ice needs to be\nreplaced entirely each year, leading to large amounts of brine\nrejection as the new ice forms, which may cause the vigor-\nous deep convection. Likewise, HadGEM2-ES (Figure 1g),\nHiGEM (Figure 1h), IPSL-CM5A-LR (Figure 1i) and MPI-\nESM-LR (Figure 1j) have less sea ice in February than is\nobserved and host deep convection in the Weddell and Ross\nGyres, but as some sea ice remains in February, their deep\nconvection is less intense than for GISS-E2-R and GFDL-\nESM2G. In contrast, CanESM2 (Figure 1b), CSIRO-Mk3-\n6-0 (Figure 1d), MRI-CGCM3 (Figure 1k), NorESM1-M\n(Figure 1l) and MIROC-ESM-CHEM (Figure 1p) maintain\nextensive sea ice during summer, and have no deep convec-\ntion in the subpolar gyres. As the ocean remains covered by\nsea ice all year long in these models, the mixed-layer is insu-\nlated from the cold atmosphere, the brine rejection process is\nsigni\ufb01cantly reduced, and no dense water is created by deep\nconvection in the subpolar gyres.\n1412\nHEUZE ET AL.: AABW IN CMIP5\n[17] Finally, INMCM4 (Figure 1n) and GFDL-ESM2M\n(Figure 1e) August sea ice extents exhibit unusual patterns,\nwith very little sea ice respectively in the Ross and Wed-\ndell Seas. This could explain why INMCM4 (Figure 2n) is\ndenser than the climatology but does not host deep convec-\ntion, while GFDL-ESM2M (Figure 2e) is less dense than\nthe climatology but has an extensive area of deep con-\nvection. However, it is also possible that these models are\nexhibiting low frequency variability or are not yet at equi-\nlibrium. Trends during the two decades of the study of the\narea-weighted mean bottom properties (see Table S1) give a\ndecrease of INMCM4\u2019s salinity of 0.008 per decade, while\nGFDL-ESM2M is cooling by 0.013\u0131C per decade. Like-\nwise, CNRM-CM5A (Figure 2c) and MIROC4h (Figure 2o),\nwhich both have low-density, warm bottom waters, also have\nsigni\ufb01cant cooling trends of 0.02\u0131C per decade.\n[18] Of the 15 models in this study, four others have\na decreasing bottom temperature trend and their bottom\ntemperature is warmer than the climatology: CSIRO-Mk3-\n6-0 (-0.011\u0131C/decade), MRI-CGCM3 (-0.010\u0131C/decade),\nNorESM1-M (\u20130.022\u0131C/decade) and MIROC-ESM-CHEM\n(\u20130.020\u0131C/decade). This suggests that these models exhibit\nlow frequency variability in bottom water properties. In\ncontrast, GISS-E2-R seems to be adjusting to a new cli-\nmate state: while it is already colder than the climatology\nin the Weddell and Ross basins, it continues cooling by\n0.023\u0131C/decade over the whole Southern Ocean. We note\nthat any model drift (as determined from control runs) has\nnot been removed from the model trends quoted here.\n4. Conclusions\n[19] Half of the 15 climate models studied here demon-\nstrate an acceptable representation of the water mass\nproperties at the sea bed around Antarctica, with their area-\nweighted RMS difference from the climatology being lower\nthan the mean of the group of models studied here for bottom\ntemperature, bottom salinity and bottom density. The other\nhalf are either too warm or too cold, too salty or too fresh.\nHowever, a difference between the modeled bottom waters\nand the observations can arise because the climate model\u2019s\nocean state has not fully adjusted from the initial conditions\nand may never approach an equilibrium state due to some\ninternal long-term trends [Sen Gupta et al., 2012].\n[20] Ten of the 15 GCMs produce dense water on the\ncontinental shelf, but in none of them can this water spill\noff the shelf, sink and spread northwards as dense bottom\nwater. For half of the models, deep water is created by\ndeep convection in the open ocean, a mechanism that rarely\noccurs in the real ocean. However, this mechanism can result\nin relatively realistic deep water properties. Such convec-\ntion would have implications for the model carbon and heat\nuptake by inducing too strong mixing and ventilation, and\nhence climate sensitivity. Models with extensive deep con-\nvection areas (GFDL-ESM2M, GISS-E2-R, MRI-CGCM3\nand GFDL-ESM2G) are the ones with a strong seasonal\ncycle in sea ice: their ocean undergoes a larger heat trans-\nfer to the atmosphere, hence cools more, becomes saltier\nthrough brine rejection and thus denser.\n[21] The three models with the best representations of\nthe sea bed properties (HadGEM2-ES, HiGEM and IPSL-\nCM5A-LR) are the ones hosting deep convection in the\nsubpolar gyres only. In contrast, models which do not\ngenerate deep convection depict poor bottom water proper-\nties and are unlikely to lead to accurate predictions of the\nfuture state of the deep ocean. Global analyses (not shown)\nsuggest that these models form their deep water either out-\nside of our area of study or through brief deep convection\nevents that we cannot detect with our temporal resolution of\nmonthly average model output.\n[22] In this study, no correlation has been found between\nthe models\u2019 performances and either their resolution\n(horizontal or vertical) or the vertical coordinate system\n(isopycnal, z-level or sigma) used.\n[23] No model reproduces the process of Antarctic bottom\nwater formation accurately. Instead of forming dense water\non the continental shelf and allowing it to spill off, mod-\nels present extensive areas of deep convection, thus leading\nto an unrealistic, unstrati\ufb01ed open ocean. Further efforts\nshould be put into a better representation of Antarctic water\nmasses and shelf processes, a key challenge to improve the\nreliability of climate projections. A grid box model can-\nnot adequately represent the down-slope \ufb02ow, and it is not\nclear that higher resolution provides improvements. It is con-\nceivable that a super-parameterization scheme [Stan et al.,\n2010] might be devised, perhaps based on a high resolution\nisopycnal model, which would improve the down-slope \ufb02ow\nrepresentation. Adaptive meshes and \ufb01nite element meshes\n[Ford et al., 2004] could be a solution to model shelf pro-\ncesses at a higher resolution than the open ocean, although\nthey are computationally costly. A simpler solution may be\nto use tunnels to instantly transport water from the shelf seas\nto the deep ocean [Briegleb et al., 2010].\n[24] Acknowledgments.

BMC Health Services Research  (2018) 18:353 \nhttps://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-018-3167-x\nBackground\nPatient safety in healthcare organizations has received\nmuch attention following the publication of the Institute\nof Medicine\u2019s (IOM) report \u201cTo Err Is Human: Building a\nSafer Health System\u201d in 2000. In its report, IOM\nhighlighted the magnitude of preventable adverse events\nand identified the underlying \u201csafety culture\u201d as a key\nelement influencing the ability of healthcare organizations\nto learn effectively from these events and implement pre-\nventative measures to reduce related harm to patients [1].\nAssessing the status of the existing safety culture in a\nhealthcare organization has been identified as the first step\nfor developing a strong and solid safety culture [2]. Safety\nculture has been defined as \u201cthe product of individual and\ngroup values, attitudes, perceptions, competencies, and\npatterns of behavior that determine the commitment to,\nand the style and proficiency of, an organization\u2019s Health\nand Safety management\u201d ([3], p.23). According to Zohar\n[4], safety culture can be described as one aspect of an or-\nganization\u2019s overall culture reflecting individual perform-\nance and organizational features that influence health and\nsafety. Nevertheless, the concept remains poorly defined\n[5]. Pidgeon [6] has criticized earlier research for being\n\u201cunsystematic, fragmented and in particular underspeci-\nfied in theoretical terms\u201d (p.203). Safety climate is often\nused interchangeably with safety culture [7] and can be\nperceived as \u201cthe measureable components of safety cul-\nture\u201d ([8], p.364). It provides a \u201csnapshot\u201d of the percep-\ntions and attitudes of the organization\u2019s workforce about\nthe surface-level aspects of culture during a particular\npoint in time ([9], p.5). Safety culture and safety climate\nare clearly derivatives of organisational culture and climate\n[5, 10]. Researchers suggested that the concept of safety\nculture could be studied within the wider context of organ-\nisational culture [5, 11]. According to Neal and Griffin et al.\n[12], \u201cSafety climate is a specific form of organisational\nclimate, which describes individual perceptions of the value\nof safety in the work environment\u201d (p.100). Reichers and\nSchneider [13] tracked the evolution of the two concepts\nand concluded that \u201cculture exists at a higher level of\nabstraction than climate, and climate is a manifestation of\nculture\u201d (p.23). In other words, safety culture is a broader\norganisational feature while safety climate is a sub-set of\nsafety culture. Guldenmund [5] concludes that safety cli-\nmate might be considered an alternative safety performance\nindicator. Cox and Flin [14] describe safety culture as the\npersonality of an organization with its relative stability of\nsystems, procedures and behaviours. Safety climate, on the\nother hand, was described as a transient mood state as\nchanges in response to external events and pressures.\nGinsburg and Tregunno et al. [15] argue for the lack of\nclarity in defining the construct of safety culture and cli-\nmate in addition to the construct of patient safety culture.\nIt is, therefore, logical to suggest that the creation of a\nuniversal model or definition of safety culture is not\nstraightforward [10]. Yet, it appears that most of the safety\nculture definitions across different organisations share\nessential elements including attitude and behaviour of\nworkers in terms of health and safety performance [10].\nThese common elements indicate the psychological aspect\nof safety culture. This aspect refers to the highly related\nconcept of safety climate. Safety climate is most com-\nmonly assessed by safety climate questionnaires to meas-\nure employee attitudes and perceptions of safety, as they\nare practical to apply in terms of time and cost-\neffectiveness [5, 16]. Cheyne and Oliver et al. [17] argue\nthat these quantitative measurements apply only to a spe-\ncific setting at a particular point in time and are subject to\nshort-term fluctuations. Kirk and Parker et al. [18] add\nthat despite their usefulness as safety measures, they offer\na superficial evaluation of an organization\u2019s culture. Add-\nitionally, Pronovost and Berenholtz et al. [19] demands\nthe need for scientifically sound and feasible measures of\npatient safety. A range of questionnaire tools have been\ndeveloped to assess safety climate in acute hospital set-\ntings, however the rigour with which they have been de-\nveloped and psychometrically tested is variable [8, 20, 21].\nA lack of rigorous psychometric evaluation makes it diffi-\ncult to confirm the validity and reliability of survey scores\nand inform organisational learning and improvement.\nThus, it is imperative that questionnaire tools are devel-\noped with robust psychometric properties [20].\nAgainst this background, our systematic review aimed\nto identify and critically review the adequacy of the re-\nported psychometric properties of tools designed to\nmeasure safety climate in acute hospital settings.\nMethods\nSearch strategy\nElectronic search of Medline, PubMed, CINAHL, Web of\nScience, PsycINFO, Embase and Scopus was performed,\nusing the key terms: \u201cSafety Culture\u201d, \u201cSafety Climate\u201d,\n\u201cSafety Attitudes\u201d, \u201cHospital Safety\u201d, \u201cPatient Safety\u201d, paired\nwith \u201cHealth Care Workers\u201d, with manual searches of\nbibliographies of included papers and key journals. This re-\nview covered English language studies published between\nJanuary 2004 to December 2014. A detailed overview of the\nsearch strategies can be found in Additional file 1.\nStudy selection\nTwo independent reviewers screened titles and abstracts\nof relevant records (GA, JM) while a third reviewer vali-\ndated the data (PB).\nSelection criteria\nThe process of identification and selection of eligible pa-\npers was conducted in two stages. The first stage involved\nevaluating the potential relevance of all titles and abstracts\nAlsalem et al. BMC Health Services Research  (2018) 18:353 Page 2 of 14\nidentified from the electronic database searches. Studies\nwere included if they met the following criteria: (1) de-\nscribed a quantitative method of assessing patient safety\nclimate, (2) described the results of tool development and\npsychometric evaluation, (3) directed at healthcare staff in\na hospital setting. In the second stage, papers that were\njudged to be potentially relevant were retrieved and\nreviewed against the full text inclusion and exclusion cri-\nteria. To be eligible for inclusion at this stage, studies had\nto primarily focus on questionnaire development and ex-\nplicitly state that the purpose of the study was to establish\nthe psychometric properties of the tool as part of tool de-\nvelopment, testing and implementation. Also, the tool also\nhad to be designed for general administration to all\nhealthcare staff working in a hospital setting and publically\navailable. Only original tools developed in English-\nlanguage were included as well as any updated version of\nan original tool that was produced by the original team in\nwhich the latest improved version was included.\nThe flow chart in Fig. 1 shows the selection process,\nincluding the detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria.\nData extraction\nData extracted included a description of study setting;\nsample characteristics; study method; and tool features\nincluding dimensions covered, psychometric performed,\ntheoretical basis and outcome measures (Tables 1, 2, 3).\nQuality appraisal\nMethodological quality of included studies was assessed\nbased on the quality criteria developed by Flin and Burns\net al. [20] (Table 4). Assessment of the quality of each\nstudy, included seven items related to the appropriate-\nness of the study methodology, study population, data\ncollection and analysis, response rate and results.\nHigher quality studies were considered to be those\nthat met a minimum of six of these seven indicators.\nPsychometric evaluation of included tools was based\non recommendations by [20] and Flin and Burns et al.\n[20] and included aspects related to content, criterion\nand construct validity and reliability (Table 3).\nVariability in safety climate dimensions across the\nreviewed papers have led the authors to evaluate the\ncontent of included dimensions in each tool. A list was\ndeveloped including the most common safety climate\ndimensions that had been previously mentioned in studies\naddressing safety climate measures in healthcare (Table 5)\n[20]. Items and their suitability in each dimension were in-\ndependently evaluated, by the three authors (GA, JM, PB),\nagainst the proposed list.\nThis study updates an earlier review by Flin and Burns\net al. [20] of quantitative studies of safety climate in\nhealthcare aimed at examining their reported psychomet-\nric properties.\nResults\nThe search strategy identified a total of 3576 potential\npapers. Of these, 88 papers were reviewed against the\nfull text inclusion criteria. Five studies met the criteria\nand were included for this review [15, 22\u201325] (Fig. 1).\nThe tools included the Hospital Survey on Patient\nSafety Culture (HSOPSC) [23], Safety Attitudes Ques-\ntionnaire (SAQ) [22], Patient Safety Climate in Health-\ncare Organizations (PSCHO) [24], Canadian Patient\nSafety Climate Scale (Can-PSC) [15], and the Safety\nOrganizing Scale (SOS) [25]. The key features and\ncharacteristics of each included study and their\nreported psychometric properties are summarized in\nTables 1, 2 and 3. Further information regarding each\ntool is in Additional file 1.\nGeneral characteristics of reviewed studies\nThe five tools were designed for general assessment of\npatient safety climate in acute hospital settings. They\naimed to assess respondents\u2019 attitudes, perceptions and\nbehaviors about various aspects of patient safety. They\nalso sampled a variety of hospital personnel across\ndifferent occupations, staff positions and work areas.\nFour of the included tools originated from US studies\n[22\u201325] while one tool originated from a study in\nCanada [15].\nAll survey tools used Likert response scales. Length of\nsurvey tools ranged from nine to 60 questionnaire items\nwith a total of 141 items distributed under 36 climate\ndimensions. Each tool covered between one (e.g. SOS)\nand twelve reported dimensions (e.g. HSOPSC).\nSeven dimensions were addressed by the majority of\nthe reviewed tools including: (1) Top management sup-\nport, (2) Safety systems, (3) Safety attitudes of staff, (4)\nReporting incidents, (5) Communication openness, (6)\nOrganizational learning and (7) Teamwork (Table 5).\nA number of tools were adapted from other industries.\nThe SAQ, for example, is a an adaptation of a widely\nused questionnaire in the aviation industry [22]. More\nrecently, tools have been developed specifically for\nhealthcare settings such as the HSOPSC [23].\nFour studies used theory to guide their tool develop-\nment process. Within these studies, the PSCHO & SOS\nwere based on High Reliability Organization Theory\n(HROT) [24, 25]. The SAQ employed more than one\ntheory. Sexton and Helmreich et al. [22] Stated that the\nSAQ was based upon two conceptual models: Vincent\u2019s\nframework for analyzing risk and safety [26] and Dona-\nbedian\u2019s conceptual model for assessing quality [27].\nVincent\u2019s framework incorporates the many factors in-\nfluencing clinical practice including organizational fac-\ntors and work environment factors while Donabedian\u2019s\nconceptual model provides a framework for evaluating\nAlsalem et al. BMC Health Services Research  (2018) 18:353 Page 3 of 14\nthe quality of healthcare [26, 27]. The theoretical basis\nfor the Can-PSCS is rooted in Zohar\u2019s definition of safety\nclimate and Hofmann and Mark\u2019s model on safety cli-\nmate [15]. Zohar\u2019s definition of safety climate stresses\nmanagement commitment to, and support of safety by\nleadership at multiple levels [28]. Hofmann and Mark\u2019s\nmodel of safety climate emphasizes open communicating\nand constructive response to errors and the degree to\nwhich the social environment encourages these behav-\niours\u2019 [29].

The response rate fell\nbelow 60% for two of those studies [23, 25]. One study\ndid not report their study population in sufficient detail\nto allow judgment to be made [22].\nPapers rated as \u2018fair\u2019 quality, including Singer and\nMeterko et al. [24] and Ginsburg and Tregunno et al.\n[15], did not describe their study population in sufficient\ndetail. The response rate was not acceptable in PSCHO\nwhile data collection was not sufficiently described in\nCan-PSC. The quality appraisal results for each individ-\nual study are summarized in Table 4.\nPsychometric properties of reviewed instruments\nThe psychometric properties of included safety tools were\nexamined with respect to content validity, criterion valid-\nity, construct validity (EFA, CFA) in addition to reliability\n(Table 6). Other measure included correlation across di-\nmensions, item analysis, test/retest reliability and analysis\nof variance. All of the reviewed tools covered the standard\npsychometric criteria, as recommended by Flin and Burns\net al. [20] (Table 3). However, three tools, including the\nHSOPSC, SAQ and SOS, reported more robust psycho-\nmetric properties following their psychometric assessment\nin comparison to PSCHO and Can-PSCS.\nThe quality appraisal results of each survey tools\u2019 psy-\nchometric properties are shown in Table 3.\nContent validity\nInstrument development, in all studies, typically involved\nthe use of literature reviews, opinions of safety experts and\nuser populations to conceptualize the domains of safety cul-\nture to be measured, and to generate related questionnaire\nitems. Definitions of safety climate and culture overlapped\namong the studies although two studies clearly draw a dis-\ntinction between the two terms and stressed that they set\nout to measure safety climate [15, 22].\nRegarding the theoretical basis of the tools, three stud-\nies [15, 22, 25] stated that their survey items were based\non a conceptual model but it was not clear how they re-\nlated theory to their questionnaire items. One exception\nwas the PSCHO where an explanation of its nine-\ndimension theoretical model was provided [24]. The\nHSOPSC had no explicit theoretical basis [23].\nTwo \u201ccore\u201d safety dimensions from the non-healthcare\nindustrial sector, \u2018management and supervisory commit-\nment to safety\u2019 and \u2018safety systems\u2019, were measured in\nfour studies as components of safety climate in health-\ncare [20] (Table 2). A plausible explanation is that most\nof the instruments were based on High Reliability\nOrganization Theory or were derived from tools de-\nsigned for those specific industries such as the SAQ.\nCriterion validity\nThree studies had no reported independent outcome\nmeasures of safety climate [15, 22, 24]. The HSOPSC in-\ncluded two self-reported outcome measures: \u2018Patient\nSafety Grade\u2019 and \u2018Number of Events Reported\u2019. Positive\nassociations have been shown between climate scores\nand self-reported safety measures [23].\nA single study used independent measures to examine\nsignificant associations between safety climate scores\nand outcomes where multilevel regression analysis\nshowed a negative relationship between SOS and re-\nported medication errors and patient falls [25].\nConstruct validity\nFactor structure and internal reliability\nAll five studies reported the results of a factor ana-\nlysis (Table 3).

CFA results are evaluated by examin-\ning the items factor loadings (0.40 or greater) and the\noverall model fit indices.\nThe HSOPSC reported factor loadings ranging from 0.\n36 to 1.00. The staffing composite had one item with\nlow factor loadings (0.36). The model fit indices were good\nwith the exception of Supervisor/Manager Expectations\nand Actions Promoting Patient Safety which reported\ncomparative fit indicator (CFIs) below the recommended\n0.90 criterion.\nSAQ reported factor loadings ranging from 0.40 to 0.\n99. The overall model fit indices were good. The SOS\nand the Can-PSC scales reported good model fit indices\nas well. PSCHO did not report any model fit indices.\nEFA was reported to be performed in all studies except\nthe SOS [25].\nReliability was reported in all of the studies (Table 3)\nand internal consistency (Cronbach\u2019s Alpha) was re-\nported in four out of five studies and exceeded the ac-\ncepted standard (\u2265 0.70), in the majority of the scale\ncomposites. The only two exceptions were the HSOPSC\n(Staffing \u03b1 = 0.62) and the PSCHO (Learning \u03b1 =0.50,\nFear of shame \u03b1 =0.58, Fear of blame \u03b1 =0.61). Raykov\u2019s\n\u00f1 coefficient was reported as the scale reliability estimate\nfor the SAQ [22]. Raykov\u2019s \u00f1 coefficient value was 0.90,\nindicating strong scale reliability.\nIntercorrelations\nThe HSOPSC intercorrelations, both among and be-\ntween the 12 safety composites and the tool\u2019s two out-\ncome measures, were moderate [23]. SAQ\u2019s reported\nintercorrelations were significant with a few exceptions\n[22]. PSCHO reported results confirm that the measure\nreflects correlated but distinct aspects of safety climate\n[24]. The Can-PSC showed that discriminant validity\nwas supported for all dimensions with the exception of\nthe incident follow-up dimension [15].\nDiscussion\nThis study aims to provide a comprehensive review of\nquantitative studies designed to assess safety climate in\nthe hospital setting, with particular focus on question-\nnaires. The objective of the systematic review was to\nprovide a structured overview of their psychometric ad-\nequacy as measurement tools for their stated purpose.\nAll of the five reviewed safety climate tools have key\nsimilarities and common dimensions. Yet, they vary in\nterms of length, theoretical grounding and reported psy-\nchometric properties. Instruments varied in scope, with\nsome covering a more comprehensive range of dimen-\nsions while others focused on the assessment of specific\ndimensions of safety culture. For example, the HSOPSC\nis a broad 42 items\u2019 tool that covers twelve safety culture\nTable 5 Safety Climate Dimensions Categorization\nSafety Climate Dimension SOS\nitems\nHSOPSC\nItems\nSAQ\nitems\nPSCHO\nitems\nCan-PSC\nitems\nTotal Number\nof items/dimension\nPercentage of items\n/dimension %\nTop management support & institutional\ncommitment to safety\n0 7 6 9 7 29 20.6\nTeamwork 5 8 7 0 0 20 14.2\nSafety systems: \u201cPolicies&Procedures, Safety\nPlanning, Hand offs & Transitions, Staffing,\nEquipment\u201d\n2 7 3 6 0 18 12.8\nSafety perceptions & Attitudes of staff,\nRisk perceptions\n0 3 3 9 1 17 11.3\nReporting Incidents & \u201cnon-punitive\u201d\nresponse to error\n0 3 1 6 5 14 10.6\nCommunication openness 1 4 4 1 0 10 7.1\nOrganizational learning and continuous\nimprovement\n1 3 0 1 4 9 6.4\nBeliefs about the causes of errors &\nadverse events\n0 0 4 3 0 7 5.0\nTraining & continuous education 0 0 3 2 0 5 3.5\nStaff satisfaction 0 0 5 0 0 5 3.5\nFeedback & Communication about\nadverse events\n0 2 0 0 2 4 2.8\nWork Pressure 0 2 0 1 0 3 2.1\nOther 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.0\nTotal 9 39 36 38 19 141 100%\nHSOPSC Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture, SAQ Safety Attitudes Questionnaire, PSCHO Patient Safety Climate in Healthcare Organizations, Can-PSC\nCanadian Patient Safety Climate Scale, SOS Safety Organizing Scale\nAlsalem et al.

It is arguably more suitable\nfor a patient safety interventional programme as it may\nhave greater potential for uncovering areas in need of\nimprovement compared to shorter questionnaires like\nthe one dimensional 9-item SOS. As a result, this tool\nmay be less sensitive in identifying problematic areas\n[30]. Shorter questionnaires, however, have the potential\nto increase the response rate and reduce the non-\nresponse bias associated with longer surveys [23, 31].\nPsychometric properties\nDespite the growing body of evidence about the value\nof establishing the psychometric properties of safety\nclimate tools, there is still a lack of proper reporting of re-\nlated questionnaire properties across published literature\n[8, 20, 32, 33]. Studies have shown considerable variation\nregarding the methods and the standards applied in\nreporting the psychometric properties [34]. This can be\npartly explained by the methodological rigor and re-\nsources required for safety climate tools to be appropri-\nately developed and psychometrically tested [21].\nFlin and Burns et al. [20] proposed that tools must be\ndeveloped with robust psychometric properties to confirm\nthe validity and reliability of safety climate test scores and\nenable proper identification of underlying dimensions.\nEmerging evidence about the predictive validity of\nsafety climate measures suggest that positive safety cli-\nmate scores are associated with clinical outcomes in-\ncluding shorter lengths of stay and fewer medication\nerrors [21]. Favourable scores have been linked also to\nsafety-related behaviours and attitudes of healthcare staff\n[4, 35, 36]. Thus, in order to provide reliable data, it is\nimperative that tools are developed with robust psycho-\nmetric properties that enable valid interpretations of pa-\ntient safety climate test scores [20].\nColla and Bracken et al. [8] and Flin and Burns et al.\n[20] argued that there was a limitation on reporting the\npsychometric properties for most of their reviewed safety\nclimate tools. Two notable exceptions were the HSOPSC\nand the SAQ where more of the indicated psychometric\ncriteria were met. Conversely, Perneger and Staines et al.\n[37] argue that even the original HSOPSC instrument did\nnot fulfill the standard psychometric criteria of a sound\nstructure as proposed by Hu and Bentler [38] and recom-\nmended that the instrument be partially redesigned.\nIn comparison to earlier studies, where standard psy-\nchometric criteria were not reported [12, 39\u201342], our\nstudy showed that all of the reviewed tools covered the\nstandard psychometric criteria, as recommended by Flin\nand Burns et al. [20]. This provide evidence for an im-\nproving trend in reporting the psychometric properties\nof tools in this area. This, as a result, places safety cli-\nmate assessment on the right track.\nA number of reported adaptations of the HSOPSC, in\nChina, France, Norway and the UK [37, 43\u201346], have\nperformed less well than the original tool. This might be\ndue to the contextual specificity of the construct of\nsafety culture [47]. As a result, there is a need for appro-\npriate validation of safety climate questionnaires before\nextending their usage in healthcare contexts different\nfrom those in which they were originally developed [34].\nSafety climate dimensions\nOver the past 10 years, a number of comprehensive re-\nviews of studies addressing patient safety in general or\npatient safety climate instruments in particular have\nbeen conducted [8, 20, 21, 48\u201352]. Most studies have\nTable 6 Psychometric Properties\nContent Validity\nHaynes et al. (1995, [77] p.238) defined Content Validity as \u201cthe degree\nto which elements of an assessment instrument are relevant to and\nrepresentative of the targeted construct for a particular assessment\npurpose\u201d. It is used for ascertaining whether the content of the measure\nwas appropriate and pertinent to the study purpose and is usually\nundertaken by seven or more experts in addition to other sources\nincluding review of empirical literature and relevant theory [78].\nCriterion Validity\nCriterion validity delivers evidence about how well scores on a measure\ncorrelate with other measures of the same construct or very similar\nunderlying constructs that theoretically should be related [79]. As Flin\net al. (2006) [20] indicated, Criterion Validity could be established by\ncorrelating the safety climate scores with outcome measures. Outcome\nmeasures of safety in health care could include items such as patient\ninjuries, worker injuries, or other organizational outcomes [20].\nConstruct Validity\nConstruct validity can be defined as the degree to which items on an\ninstrument relate to the relevant theoretical construct [80]. A variety of\nways exists to assess the construct validity of an instrument, including\nFactor analysis. Factor analysis is a statistical method that \u201cexplores the\nextent to which individual items in a questionnaire can be grouped\ntogether according to the correlations between the responses to them\u201d,\nthus reducing the dimensionality of the data (Hutchinson et al.,\n2006, [81] p.348). Convergent Validity represents the degree to which\ndifferent measures of the same construct show correlation with each\nother and is tested using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Conversely,\nDiscriminant Validity represents the extent to which measures of\ndifferent constructs show correlation with one other [78]. The two main\ntechniques of Factor Analysis are Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), and\nConfirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). EFA is used to uncover the\nunderlying factor structure of a questionnaire, while CFA is used to test\nthe proposed factor structure of the questionnaire [81]. A CFA\nmeasurement model shows convergent validity if items load\nsignificantly (.40 or greater) onto the assigned factor and model fit\nindices suggest adequate fit [25]. Models with a cutoff value close to\n.90 for CFI; a cutoff value close to .08 for SRMR; and a cutoff value close\nto .06 for RMSEA are indicative of good model fit [38].\nReliability\nReliability reflects the degree to which test scores are replicable [76, 82].\nIt ensures that respondents are responding consistently to the items\nwithin each composite. Reliability is also referred to as consistency. It\ncan be assessed using Cronbach\u2019s alpha, which is the most commonly\nused internal consistency reliability coefficient. Cronbach\u2019s alpha ranges\nfrom 0 to 1.00 with the minimum criterion for acceptable reliability is an\nalpha of at least .70. [83, 84].\nAlsalem et al. BMC Health Services Research  (2018) 18:353 Page 9 of 14\nsuffered from an absence of clarity in defining the con-\nstructs of safety culture and climate in addition to that\nof patient safety culture [15]. The construct of safety cul-\nture has been described by Reason [53] as having the\n\u201cdefinitional precision of a cloud\u201d (p.192). This is\nreflected in a wide range of dimensions being incorpo-\nrated into safety climate surveys, which may \u201cdilute this\ndomain\u201d ([54], p.2). A significant degree of overlap exists\nin the content of the dimensions between different sur-\nveys (e.g. between the items within dimensions related\nto teamwork and communication openness), which may\nbe a consequence of using different definitions (broad or\nnarrow) of safety dimensions. Differences in judgment of\nthe content of dimensions between different authors also\nplay a major role. As a results, it is difficult to judge\nwhether measures exploring twelve dimensions have\ngreater or lesser validity than those measures examining\nonly one dimension [21].\nThe most common dimensions mentioned in the\nabove review studies were used as the basis for our\ncategorization process. Our results show an overlap with\nthose reviews as seven of the included dimensions were\ncovered by our five reviewed tools (Table 7). The results\nalso corroborate the recommendations of Singla and\nKitch et al. [21], which suggested that common dimen-\nsions including communication, teamwork, and leader-\nship support might be considered \u201ccore dimensions\u201d of\npatient safety culture.\nIn our view, the SAQ addresses human factors and job\nsatisfaction along with fundamental aspects of safety cul-\nture while the HSOPSC includes handoffs and transi-\ntions and the role of supervisors in promoting patient\nsafety. Risk-taking behavior, a commonly measured\nsafety dimension in other industries, was only covered\nby the PSCHO [24]. The SOS was developed as a self-\nreport measure of safety organizing that captures the be-\nhaviours theorized to enable a safety culture [25]. It\nmainly stresses teamwork. Ausserhofer [55] highlighted\nthat the SOS items, compared to the SAQ, might not\nfully capture the \u201cpsychological safety\u201d aspects including\nfear of blame and shame (p.131). The Can-PSCS focuses\non management commitment to patient safety and is\nrecommended for use before patient safety improvement\ninitiatives focusing on learning from errors in order to\nassess the context for change. Finally, the PSCHO fo-\ncuses on management commitment to safety, safety sys-\ntems, and safety attitudes of staff. (Table 2). This\ndiversity in focus is partly related to the tools\u2019 develop-\nment process as the above models are mainly driven by\nexpert opinion and not necessarily reflect what hospital\nstaff think about patient safety [37].\nMost of the reviewed studies failed to examine the in-\nfluence of local cultural factors as part of their safety cli-\nmate assessment tools. Almutairi [56] questioned the\nimpact of multicultural workforce on safety climate in\nhealthcare settings and concluded that this diversity can\nadversely affect the quality of care and patient safety. In\na study by Algahtani [57], the author investigated the in-\nfluence of a multicultural workforce in Saudi Arabia on\npatient safety and developed a new dimension, Multicul-\ntural Workplace, with items relating to local culture to\nassist in measuring cultural factors related to patient\nsafety. Results showed strong, positive correlations with\nmost SAQ dimensions indicating its relevance and\nTable 7 A comparison of the common safety climate dimensions in healthcare that are mentioned in four review papers\nSafety culture dimensions Safety climate/culture studies\nColla and Bracken\net al.

Another area that is\noverlooked is the physical environment of a hospital fa-\ncility, including its technology and equipment, and its ef-\nfect on patient safety [58]. In addition, little is known\nabout the effect of the psychosocial work environment,\nincluding job demands and resources available to cope\nwith them, on safety climate [59].\nOverall, these studies highlight the need for robust re-\nsearch to clarify which dimensions belong to the core\nconcept of safety culture, as Flin and Burns et al. [20]\nhave argued for, \u201ca set of universal or core variables that\nunderpin safety climate across work sectors\u201d.\nTheoretical basis\nThe lack of theoretical evidence supporting the process\nof safety climate tools\u2019 development has been clearly ar-\nticulated by most of the reviews carried out in industry\nand in healthcare [8, 20, 60]. A theoretical basis is\ndeemed to be an essential component of a psychometric-\nally sound tool to outline the proposed relationships be-\ntween safety climate and safety outcomes and if\ntheoretical assumptions are not explicit, then evidence\non the construct validity of the developed instruments is\ninadequate. This makes it difficult for organizations to\nuse questionnaires effectively for organizational learning\nand development aims [49, 61].\nGuldenmund [5] conducted a review of safety culture\nand climate research and concluded that \u201cAll in all, the\nmodels of safety culture are unsatisfactory to the extent\nthat they do not embody a causal chain but rather spe-\ncify some broad categories of interest and tentative rela-\ntionships between those\u201d (p243). Additionally, Groves\nand Meisenbach et al. [62] argue that it is not surprising\nfor a concept, such as safety culture, collected from mul-\ntiple disciplines, to lack a strong theoretical basis in a\nfundamentally different healthcare setting.\nThe theoretical roots of patient safety culture research\nlie mostly in high-risk industries [55]. According to Hal-\nligan and Zecevic [49], the five most commonly cited\ntheories or models in healthcare research include: [1]\nHigh-Reliability Organization Theory (HROT) [2, 63]\nDonabedian\u2019s Quality of Care Model [64] and its adapta-\ntions including the SEIPS model [58] and Quality Health\nOutcomes Model [3, 65] The Cultural Maturity Model\n[4, 66] Organizational Theory [63] and [5] System The-\nory [67]. According to Guldenmund [5]), no single safety\nculture theory or model has been universally accepted as\nclearly reflecting the construct of safety culture and\nsafety climate and none of the theories or models may\nbe applicable to all types of organisations .\nSafety culture and climate theories in healthcare are\nclearly limited as none of the reviewed tools draw upon\nrelated theory. Additionally, it was stated earlier that\nfour studies used theory to guide their tool development\nprocess but none provide an adequate explanation about\ntheir guiding theoretical framework nor do they clearly\narticulate the links between questionnaire items and spe-\ncific theoretical constructs. Walshe and Boaden [68]\npoint to the HSOPSC as having \u201cno explicit theoretical\nframework\u201d. HSOPSC, along with SAQ, was developed\nbased on literature reviews, existing safety culture in-\nstruments and further input by researchers and hospital\nadministrators. This suggests that researchers over-\nlooked the importance of the epistemological and theor-\netical roots that underlie the development of their\ninstruments [49] with more focus on the measurement\nrather than further conceptual development [69].\nGroves and Meisenbach et al. [62] add that recent devel-\nopments in safety culture have heightened the need for a\ntheory that describes the process of keeping patients safe\nthrough the interaction between organizational structures\nat the macro-level and individual actions at the micro-\nlevel. They add that such theory is crucial for further pro-\ngress towards patient safety.\nReiman and Silla et al. [61] stated that most studies\noverlook defining the underlying concept and frequently\njump directly to \u201coperationalisation\u201d of the measure. This\nmakes it difficult to evaluate how well the questionnaire\nactually measure the phenomena it aims to measure.\nEarly attempts to measure safety climate were based\non adapting existing instruments from other industries\n(aviation, oil, nuclear) to healthcare settings [70, 71]. For\nexample, the PSCHO and SOS were based on HROT.\nThe theoretical bases of some of the original instru-\nments, explain relationships between safety culture or\nsafety climate in settings \u201cfar-removed from healthcare\u201d\n([55], p.129). The organisational structures and cultures\nof such industries are different than those of healthcare\norganisations [72]. When the processes of safety culture\nare not clearly understood, this makes it difficult to\nevaluate how well the questionnaire actually measures\nthe phenomena under study and calls into question the\ninterpretation of survey results [62].\nIn 2006, Flin et al. reviewed twelve safety climate mea-\nsures designed for the health care setting. Building on\ntheir search criteria, we have uncovered additional mea-\nsures being applied for different healthcare settings.\nNevertheless, these additional measures, arguably, add to\nthe present state of ambiguity in the assessment of safety\nculture in healthcare.\nIn this review, a detailed inspection of the included\ntools revealed a number of limitations to these measures.\nThe limitations and ambiguity center around the con-\ncepts of safety culture and climate, their associated di-\nmensions, the methodological rigor associated with the\ndesign of these measures and the lack of clarity in the\nrelationship between safety culture and outcomes [62].\nThe influence of safety climate on patient and worker\nAlsalem et al. BMC Health Services Research  (2018) 18:353 Page 11 of 14\nsafety outcomes is not yet clear, though studies have\nstarted to confirm that safety climate scores can be asso-\nciated with healthcare workers\u2019 safety behaviours or\nworkers\u2019 injuries [32]. There is a need for more evidence\nto understand how the use of safety culture or climate\ntools impact on outcomes [73].\nIn a number of comprehensive reviews of safety cli-\nmate tools in healthcare, the HSOPSC and SAQ repeat-\nedly emerged as recommended tools [20, 21, 48, 49].\nResults of our systematic review seem to mirror findings\nof previous studies that have examined hospital safety\nclimate where the three studies that reported the SAQ,\nHSOPSC and SOS tools have been reported to have\ngood assessment of their reported psychometric proper-\nties [22, 23, 25].\nStrengths and limitations\nThe strengths of our review are that it represented a\ncomprehensive examination of safety climate tools de-\nsigned for hospitals. A thorough search strategy was\nemployed with all stages of the review process per-\nformed with at least two independent reviewers in order\nto avoid selection bias. Study rigor was enhanced using a\npre-set protocol, standardized forms, and a series of in-\ndicators to assess the quality of the reviewed studies and\nthe reported psychometric properties.\nThere are also several limitations to our study. The ex-\nclusion of other bibliographic databases, grey literature,\nand non- English language papers could potentially lead\nto overlooking some studies. Regarding the assessment\nof the quality of the reviewed studies, some quality indi-\ncators were not reported in sufficient detail to allow a\njudgment to be made. In such cases, the indicator was\nmarked as unmet and the study quality might have been\nunderestimated due to under reporting. Finally, despite\nusing three reviewers to categorise the items, there is\nstill the possibility that bias was introduced by the quali-\ntative nature of the process.\nTheoretical and practical implications\nFurther research is necessary in the development of\nsafety culture theories in healthcare, to study the links\nbetween culture and outcomes, and to resolve the con-\ntroversies in the definitions and dimensions of safety\nculture and climate [74]. There is also a need for a safety\nclimate tool to evaluate safety attributes in the \u201clocal\u201d\nhospital setting bearing in mind the unique characteris-\ntics of that particular setting and population.\nOn a practical level, the development of a standardized\nchecklist for assessing the quality of climate question-\nnaires, including reported psychometrics, may be benefi-\ncial and help provide a more detailed account of the\nquestionnaire development process. Additionally, employ-\ning mixed methods tool development approaches may\nhelp to reveal different aspects of an organization\u2019s safety\nculture, which can inform and illuminate multiple compo-\nnents of this multidimensional construct than is currently\nthe case [50].\nConclusions\nThe perceived importance of safety culture in improving\npatient safety and its impact on patient outcomes has led\nto an increasing number of studies that attempt to define\nand assess safety culture in healthcare settings. Several re-\nviews uncovered a wide variety of safety climate tools\navailable for use [8, 20, 21]. Still, theoretical and methodo-\nlogical challenges limit their use as assessment measures.\nPronovost and Sexton [75] warned that \u201cthe enthusiasm\nfor measuring culture may be outpacing the science\u201d.\nCritics have increasingly called for more rigorous assess-\nments of safety culture and more in-depth reporting.\nIt is recommended that research first be conducted to\nresolve the controversies in the definitions and dimen-\nsions of safety culture and climate, and focus on develop-\ning theoretical models with more evidence to understand\nhow safety culture or climate impacts on outcomes. Also,\nmore consideration should be given to psychometric\nproperties in the design and selection of tools in order to\nensure the robustness of the resulting safety culture data.\nPsychometric testing, on its own, does not fully\ncharacterize an instrument with other forms of item\nanalysis, such as cognitive testing, as they provide rich\ninsight into locally held attitudes and perceptions related\nto patient safety.\nWhen choosing a suitable instrument, healthcare pro-\nviders should be guided by a combination of factors includ-\ning intended purpose, target population, and the tool\u2019s\nreported psychometric properties. This is likely to be an\nidentified training need for those interested in understanding\nof the differences between the various available instruments\nand their limitations. The outcomes of this systematic review\nwill provide guidance and support to healthcare policy-\nmakers, survey users and safety researchers to make more\ninformed decisions when selecting or developing an appro-\npriate safety climate assessment tool.\nAdditional file\nAdditional file 1: Search Strategy.

No systematic \napproach to assess climate vulnerability of protected areas and their associated communities has existed\u2014un-\ntil now. The Climate Vulnerability Index (CVI) is scientifically robust, transparent, and repeatable, and has now \nbeen applied to various World Heritage properties. The CVI builds upon an established Intergovernmental Panel \non Climate Change (IPCC) framework to systematically assess vulnerability through a risk assessment approach \nthat considers the key values of the World Heritage property in question and identifies key climate stressors. The \nCVI process is then used to assess the climate-related vulnerability of the community (including local residents, \ndomestic visitors, and international tourists) associated with the World Heritage property considering economic, \nsocial, and cultural connections. Climate impacts are increasingly adding to a wide range of compounding pressures \n(e.g., increasing tourism, infrastructure development, changing land use practices) that are affecting places, people, \ncustoms, and values. Applications of the CVI to date have led to commitments to integrate outcomes into relevant \nmanagement plans, and to periodically repeat the process, enabling responsive management to changing future \ncircumstances. The CVI has also demonstrated its potential applicability for protected areas beyond World Heritage \nproperties. The CVI process engages local community members in determining impacts, provides opportunities for \nidentifying adaptation and impact mitigation within the community, and aids broader communication about key \nclimate issues.\nAssessing the climate vulnerability \nof the world\u2019s natural and cultural heritage\nIntroduction \nClimate change is the fastest-growing threat to heri-\ntage\u2014both natural and cultural\u2014including heritage in \nall types of marine and terrestrial ecosystems world-\nwide (Osipova et al. 2017; ICOMOS 2019). Climate im-\npacts are increasingly adding to a wide range of other \ncompounding pressures (e.g., increasing tourism, in-\nfrastructure development, changing land use practice) \nthat are affecting places, people, species, ecosystems, \ncustoms, and values (Markham et al. 2016). However, \nthere has not been, until recently, a tool to systemat-\nically assess climate change across a broad range of \nprotected area types. \nThe Climate Vulnerability Index (CVI) has met this \nneed. The CVI is a rapid assessment tool initially \ncreated to assess climate change vulnerability in all \ntypes of World Heritage properties\u2014natural, cultural, \nand mixed. It is a comprehensive approach that bal-\nances scientific robustness and credibility with a level \nof practicality that can be undertaken in a variety of \nrapid delivery modes (from an abbreviated 2\u20133-hour \nCVI Snapshot by managers, up to a comprehensive \nmulti-day CVI Workshop of diverse stakeholders). The \ntransparency of the process is such that it can be read-\nily repeated to assess trends at the same site over time. \nThe framework can also be applied to assess climate \nvulnerability of other types of protected areas.\nPSF  36/1  |  2020        145\nClimate change and World Heritage \nThere are over 1,100 World Heritage properties in 2019, \nconsidered \u201cthe best of the best\u201d globally. Many of \nthese properties are already experiencing significant \nnegative impacts and damage from climate change (see \nTable 1). Examples in natural systems include:\n\u2022\t Bleaching events driven by marine heat waves have \nincreased and are projected to become more fre-\nquent and severe for the 29 natural World Heritage \nsites that contain tropical coral reefs (Heron et al. \n2017); this is likely to lead to massive changes to \ncoral reef ecosystems. \n\u2022\t Increases in atmospheric temperatures have driven \nthe loss of glaciers worldwide in both mountain \nand polar regions, with further loss projected this \ncentury under current emissions practices (Bosson \net al. 2019).\n\u2022\t Terrestrial biodiversity is being affected with the \nshifting of species\u2019 geographic ranges, changes in \nthe timing of biological cycles, modification of the \nfrequency and intensity of wildfires, migration of \npests and invasive species, etc. (Pecl et al. 2017)\nWorld Heritage cultural sites are also threatened by \nclimate change; for example:\n\u2022\t Of the 49 coastal cultural World Heritage sites in \nthe Mediterranean, 47 are likely to be negatively \naffected by flooding and/or coastal erosion due to \nsea-level rise by 2100 (Reiman et al. 2019)\n\u2022\t Many cultural World Heritage properties that are \npopular tourist attractions have been identified by \nUNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific, \nand Cultural Organization) and others as at risk \nfrom climate change, including the Statue of Lib-\nerty, USA; Rapa Nui (Easter Island), Chile; Stone-\nhenge, UK; and Venice, Italy (Markham et al. 2016).\n\u2022\t Many types of built heritage (e.g., ancient and \nmodern structures) are being impacted by a wide \nrange of climate stressors. Climate stressors are \nalso causing degradation or loss of other types of \ntangible heritage (e.g., physical artefacts, archae-\nological material) and intangible heritage (e.g., \ncultural practices, traditional knowledge; UNESCO \n2007; ICOMOS 2019).\nThe severity of current climate impacts on individual \nWorld Heritage properties varies, as do the range of \nclimate change stressors causing them and the rates at \nwhich impacts are occurring. In most cases, the con-\nsequence of climate change is a decline in the values \nthat collectively comprise the reason they were listed \nas World Heritage: their Outstanding Universal Value \n(OUV). In recent years, the World Heritage Commit-\ntee has become increasingly concerned about climate \nchange impacting properties around the world, but no \nprocess has existed to adequately cope with climate \nchange in a systematic way for all types of heritage.\nThe first two authors of this paper developed the initial \nCVI framework for application to World Heritage. The \nCVI built upon a vulnerability framework described by \nthe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC \n2007). Input and guidance for the CVI were provided \nby various colleagues from James Cook University, \nthe Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research \nOrganisation (CSIRO), and other Townsville-based en-\ntities, and subsequently from other colleagues around \nthe world, including from the International Council on \nMonuments and Sites (ICOMOS) and the International \nUnion for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), two of the \nadvisory bodies for the World Heritage Committee.\nApplying the CVI to World Heritage\nThe CVI uses a risk assessment approach and compris-\nes two distinct stages (Figure 1):\n1. OUV Vulnerability, assessing potential impacts on \nthe key values for which the property is recognized; \nand\n2. Community Vulnerability, based on economic, \nsocial, and cultural connections of the associated \ncommunity (local, national, and international) with \nthe World Heritage property, the dependency of \nthe community upon the property, and the capacity \nof the community to adapt to climate change.\nBoth of these vulnerability assessments are highly \nrelevant for key stakeholders, including site managers, \nresponsible management agencies, businesses that are \ndependent on the property, and local communities \naround the property. The Community Vulnerability \nassessment builds upon work by Marshall et al. (2013) \nto provide a useful tool for comprehensively assessing \npotential impacts on communities and the adaptive \ncapacity of those communities. \nThe CVI process is best undertaken through a work-\nshop of diverse stakeholders (including site managers, \nresearchers, community representatives, dependent \nbusiness owners, management agency representatives, \nand other stakeholders) that systematically undertakes \nthe steps outlined below. Further information about \nthe CVI methodology is provided in the Supplemen-\ntary Material ; a comprehensive description of the \nCVI methodology and its application are available in a \nreport by Historic Environment Scotland assessing cli-\nPSF  36/1  |  2020        146\nTAble 1.

Summarize the elements of UNESCO\u2019s official \nstatement describing the World Heritage proper-\nty\u2019s OUV into a list of specific key values;\n2. From a compiled list of climate stressors (see \nTables 2 and 3) determine the three likely to have \nthe greatest impact on the key values within an \nagreed-upon timeframe; and\n3. Undertake a preliminary assessment of the current \ncondition of and trend in the key values since the \ninscription of the property on the World Heritage \nList.\nOnce these three foundational steps are completed, the \nfollowing eight steps are used to apply the CVI frame-\nwork (Figure 1): \n1. Conduct a high-level risk assessment (in terms of \nexposure and sensitivity) of the OUV with re-\nspect to the three key climate stressors within the \nchosen timeframe (e.g., by 2050). This process also \nconsiders some important modifiers that may vary \nthese assessments (for example, the frequency of \nexposure to events; and the spatial extent of the \nproperty that is impacted\u2014see the Supplementary \nMaterial for additional information).\n2. Use the spreadsheet-based worksheet to identify \nthe potential impact of each of the three key cli-\nmate stressors on the key World Heritage values.\n3. Consider the likely adaptive capacity of the OUV in \nrelation to the key climate stressors.\n4. Use the worksheet to determine the OUV Vulnera-\nbility component.\n5. Consider, and assess separately, the community\u2019s \neconomic, social, and cultural (ESC) dependencies \nupon the World Heritage property.\n6. Use the worksheet to determine the potential cli-\nmate impacts on the ESC dependencies.\nFIgure 1. The Climate Vulnerability Index (CVI) framework.\nPSF  36/1  |  2020        148\n7. Consider, and assess separately, the level of ESC \nadaptive capacity within the community.\n8. Use the worksheet to determine the Community \nVulnerability component.\nTo be most effective, various preworkshop tasks are \nrecommended. Workshop participants should be pro-\nvided with:\n\u2022\t A summary of the current climatic influences and \nprojected climate changes for the World Heritage \nproperty compiled by experts familiar with the best \navailable climate science\u2014this helps to facilitate a \ncommon level of informed discussion during the \nworkshop;\n\u2022\t UNESCO\u2019s statement describing the OUV for the \nproperty, so participants understand how the key \nvalues were derived;\n\u2022\t The compiled list of climate stressors (Tables 2 and \n3) from which participants are asked to nominate \ntheir top three stressors most likely to impact the \nkey values; and\n\u2022\t A summary of the key economic activities directly \nassociated with the property.\nIt is worth noting that some managers and research-\ners may have only limited experience with a property, \nwhich reinforces the importance of inviting some \nlongstanding, informed locals and experts who have \nexperienced changes over many decades. This diversity \nof participants provides an important balance of per-\nspectives, minimizing the \u201cshifting baseline\u201d dilemma. \nOur experience has shown that this provides the most \ncomprehensive application of, and outcomes from, the \nCVI process.\nA key feature of the CVI is the systematic consider-\nation of the ESC connections to assess the Community \nVulnerability component. In each of these, we first \nconsider the community\u2019s current dependency upon \nthe property and then evaluate the capacity to adapt in \nthe future.\n\u2022\t Economic connections. These refer to the tangi-\nble (i.e., direct) economic value of business types \ndirectly associated with the World Heritage proper-\nty (e.g., those operating inside the property bound-\nary). We emphasize that this assessment is un-\ndertaken at the level of broad business types (e.g., \nday-tourism operations, multiday tourism trips, re-\nsorts, cruise ships, commercial fishing operations, \ntours, educational excursions, etc.) rather than for \nindividual businesses. The economic dependency \nterm describes the estimated future change in mar-\nket economic value due to the key climate stress-\nors, which may be negative or positive. Economic \nadaptive capacity considers how the identified \nbusiness types are likely to cope (based on cur-\nrent capability) with anticipated future impacts of \nclimate change. As the purpose of adaptive capacity \nis to mitigate (i.e., reduce) potential impacts, only \none directionality (positive) is relevant.\n\u2022\t Social connections. These refer only to physi-\ncal interactions of people with the property; i.e., \nindividuals must have visited or used the property. \nThe social dependency term describes the extent to \nwhich the key climate stressors will affect society \nnow, and considers locals, domestic visitors, and \ninternational tourists separately. Social dependen-\ncy can be assessed as either negative or positive. \nSocial adaptive capacity (positive directionality) \nconsiders how the three societal groups are likely \nto cope, based on current capability, with anticipat-\ned future impacts of climate change.\n\u2022\t Cultural connections. These refer to affinities \nwith the property and do not require a physical \ninteraction with it; i.e., individuals need not have \nvisited the property to have an affinity with it. The \ncultural dependency term describes the extent to \nwhich the key climate stressors will affect culture \nnow, and considers locals, domestic visitors, and \ninternational tourists separately. Cultural depen-\ndency can be assessed as either negative or posi-\ntive. Cultural adaptive capacity (positive direction-\nality) considers how the three groups are likely to \ncope, based on current capability, with anticipated \nfuture impacts of climate change.\nThe CVI process weights each element equally; how-\never, this may not best reflect the actual situation. For \nexample, (1) for economic connections, there may be \ncertain business types that are of greater economic \nimportance; and (2) for social connections, one group \n(such as locals) may be considered of greater signifi-\ncance than others. Workshop participants are asked to \nevaluate whether the ESC outcomes need to be revised \nin light of these considerations. This opportunity for \nhigh-level revision ensures the final outcome reflects \nthe proper levels of dependency and adaptive capacity \nfor the community associated with the World Heritage \nproperty.\nCVI workshops to date\nShark Bay, Western Australia was the first World \nHeritage property to trial the CVI. An initial work-\nshop was held in September 2018 to assess the OUV \nVulnerability (http://nespclimate.com.au/wp-content/\nuploads/2016/03/SBWH A-CC-workshop-report.pdf); a \nPSF  36/1  |  2020        149\nTAble 2.

The 13 climate stressors as used in the CVI, showing examples of the impacts caused by these stressors.\nPSF  36/1  |  2020        150\nfollow-up workshop in June 2019 completed the Com-\nmunity Vulnerability component (final report currently \nin preparation). Shark Bay includes exceptional natural \nfeatures: vast seagrass beds, stromatolites (the oldest \nforms of life on earth), and several endangered marine \nand terrestrial mammals (https://whc.unesco.org/en/\nlist/578). The two Shark Bay workshops:\n\u2022\t Identified the three key climate stressors as: air \ntemperature change, extreme marine heat events, \nand storm intensity and frequency\u2014considered \nover a time scale to ca. 2050;\n\u2022\t Determined that the OUV Vulnerability was rated \nas the highest category (\u201cHigh\u201d), based on the pro-\njected exposure, system sensitivity, and adaptive \ncapacity; and\n\u2022\t Assessed the Community Vulnerability also to be \n\u201cHigh,\u201d acknowledging there was little ability of \nthe community to cope with projected changes.\nHeart of Neolithic Orkney (HONO) in Scotland was \nthe first cultural World Heritage property assessed, \nduring a three-day workshop in April 2019 (https://\nwww.historicenvironment.scot/hono-cvi). HONO \nrefers to a group of four Neolithic sites: an ancient set-\ntlement, a burial chamber, and two ceremonial stone \ncircles (https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/514). Climate \nchange has the potential for severe negative impacts \non this 5,000-year-old site and the surrounding areas, \ngiven their location in the Orkney Islands. A key com-\nponent of HONO, the prehistoric coastal settlement \nat Skara Brae, was itself discovered as the result of a \nstorm in 1850, underlining the vulnerability of this site.\nHONO was chosen as the first cultural World Heritage \nproperty to be assessed using the CVI for several rea-\nsons, including:\n\u2022\t The leadership and innovation in addressing cli-\nmate change and its heritage implications by His-\ntoric Environment Scotland (HES), the public body \nresponsible for the care and promotion of HONO; \n\u2022\t The engagement of the Archaeology Institute at \nthe University of the Highlands and Islands and \nthe Orkney community with their historic environ-\nment and archaeological activities; and\n\u2022\t Recently updated regional climate scenarios.\nThe CVI workshop for HONO:\n\u2022\t Identified the three key climate stressors as: \nprecipitation change, sea-level change, and storm \nintensity and frequency\u2014considered over a time \nscale to ca. 2050;\n\u2022\t Determined that the OUV Vulnerability was rated \nas the highest category (\u201cHigh\u201d), based on the pro-\njected exposure, system sensitivity, and adaptive \ncapacity;\n\u2022\t Assessed Community Vulnerability as the middle \ncategory (\u201cModerate\u201d), acknowledging the high \nlevel of adaptive capacity within the community; \nand\n\u2022\t Concluded that climate impacts are increasing-\nly likely to add to a wide range of compounding \npressures that collectively are impacting the \nislands themselves, and their heritage and cultural \nresources.\nBoth workshops identified a number of research gaps \nas well as various policy gaps, and guided the develop-\nment of climate change adaptation strategies. Appendi-\nces to the HONO workshop report provide information \nthat has assisted planning and preparation for subse-\nquent CVI workshops.\nbenefits of the CVI \nApplication of the CVI to date has demonstrated that \nit: \n1. Is a rapid assessment tool  that works for, and is \nable to be consistently applied to, the full range of \nWorld Heritage properties (natural, cultural, and \nmixed).\n2. Is able to rapidly assess the physical and ecolog-\nical impacts of climate change on a property\u2019s \nOUV, but also provide a high-level assessment of the \neconomic, social, and cultural consequences of climate \nchange for communities that depend on an individ-\nual World Heritage property.\n3. Is scientifically rigorous, systematic, and comprehen-\nsive yet not overly complex (balancing scientific \nand political credibility with practicality at the \nproperty level). \n4. Is repeatable, allowing for assessments over time to \nassess trends (in the current era of rapidly chang-\ning climate, the ability to reassess vulnerability \nat periodic intervals in the light of new scientific \nunderstanding can guide updates of management \nactions).\n5. Is transparent, enabling others to see exactly how \nthe assessment was derived.\n6. Puts climate change into context; i.e., climate change \nis becoming a dominant threat to many World \nHeritage values but is only one of many cumulative \npressures affecting World Heritage properties in \ngeneral. \n7. Provides opportunity to identify adaptation strategies \nin the face of potential impacts, with a consistent \nPSF  36/1  |  2020        151\nmethodology that supports applications for funds \nand other resources.\n8. Assists in better understanding by local and Indige-\nnous communities and other users of World Heritage \nproperties of climate change and its impacts (there-\nfore it is a key engagement tool).\n9. Assists other World Heritage properties with similar \nvalues but less expertise to benefit from preexisting \nassessments. \n10. Is standardized, so that it can ultimately become \npart of World Heritage processes (such as State \nof Conservation reports, periodic reporting, and \nnominations).\nGiven the rapidly changing climate, three of the above \nfeatures are particularly important. Firstly, the applica-\nbility of the CVI to all types of World Heritage prop-\nerties means that it provides a standardized approach \nfor assessing climate vulnerability. Secondly, the \nrepeatability of the CVI means that changing condi-\ntions can be evaluated over a specified timeframe (e.g., \n3\u20135 years), as can the effectiveness of management \nresponses. Thirdly, the transparency of the CVI process \nmeans that the process can be rerun to test the sensi-\ntivity of the final outputs to different assessments of \nindividual steps (by the same participants or a different \ngroup).\nWidespread interest in the CVI has led to:\n\u2022\t Development of the CVI website\u00a0(https://cvi-heri-\ntage.org/);\n\u2022\t Publication of a plain-English outline in The Con-\nversation (https://theconversation.com/from-shark-\nbay-seagrass-to-stone-age-scotland-we-can-now-\nassess-climate-risks-to-world-heritage-119643);\n\u2022\t Numerous briefings for agencies and countries who \nare concerned about climate change impacts on \ntheir heritage; and \n\u2022\t Endorsement of the CVI by the Climate Change \nand Heritage Working Group of ICOMOS, and by \nthe Protected Areas Climate Change Specialist \nGroup of the IUCN World Commission on Protect-\ned Areas, both of whom have made it part of their \ncurrent work program.\nApplications of the CVI to date have led to proposals \nto integrate outcomes into relevant management plans, \nand to periodically repeat the process, enabling man-\nagement that is responsive to changing future circum-\nstances. The CVI process engages local community \nmembers in identifying key climate stressors and im-\npacts, as well as offering opportunities for adaptation \nand impact mitigation for both the property itself and \nwithin the community. The systematic nature of CVI \nmeans that it can assist in prioritizing actions, help to \nstrengthen community and institutional capacity, and \nimprove protected area governance.\nWhere to next for the CVI? \nThe HONO workshop provided lessons for other her-\nitage sites across Orkney and elsewhere in Scotland. \nHES has now recommended that the CVI process be \nrepeated for HONO every five years, in parallel with \nthe management review cycle. HES is also proposing to \nundertake CVI workshops for all Scottish World Heri-\ntage properties, with two further applications planned \nfor 2020, and has noted that \u201cthe process is flexible and \nrigorous enough for much wider application and it is \nanticipated that others will find the format and process \nuseful when considering the key values and climate \nchange challenges at heritage sites worldwide.\u201d For its \npart, the Shark Bay Advisory Committee is using the \noutcomes of the CVI process to inform development of \ntheir climate change adaptation strategy. \nSeveral additional Australian World Heritage proper-\nties have expressed a strong interest in applying the \nCVI, as have others in Europe, the Americas, Asia, and \nthe Middle East.\nApplying the CVI beyond World Heritage\nWhile the CVI was developed for World Heritage \nproperties, the CVI framework has demonstrated its \nadaptability for other protected areas. The majority of \nprotected areas have a statement describing the values \nfor which they are recognized, akin to the statement of \nOUV for World Heritage properties. These statements \ncan provide the anchor point from which the CVI pro-\ncess is applied. \nInterest in the CVI has spread to managers of other \ntypes of protected areas. For example, the managers \nof National Trust properties in the United Kingdom \nare considering whether the tool might be useful for \na wide range of their heritage interests. In addition, \nIndigenous groups associated with the Great Barrier \nReef have expressed an interest in trialing the tool. \nIUCN has requested further work be undertaken to see \nhow the CVI can inform its periodic assessment for the \nIUCN World Heritage Outlook. \nWork is therefore currently underway to develop other \ndelivery modes for the CVI process to provide a tiered \nset of rapid assessment options. The \u201dCVI Spectrum\u201d \n(Figure 2) highlights three such options to assess \naspects of the CVI. For example, the \u201cCVI Snapshot\u201d \nprovides an initial assessment of only the vulnerabil-\nPSF  36/1  |  2020        152\nity of key values within the CVI framework. This may \nassist in prioritizing which protected areas require a \nmore comprehensive assessment, for which more time \nand resources are required. The \u201cCVI Workshop\u201d is the \ngold standard for assessing climate vulnerability using \nthe CVI framework, as it applies all of the elements \nand draws upon the perspectives of a diverse group of \nparticipants.\nConclusion\nThe CVI is increasingly being acknowledged across the \ninternational heritage community as providing a sys-\ntematic assessment of the impacts of climate change \nupon World Heritage properties through a transparent \nand repeatable process. Applications of the framework \nhave indicated that it can be adapted for use in protect-\ned areas beyond World Heritage, and there is substan-\ntial and growing interest to do so. \nIn the current era of rapid climate change, under-\nstanding vulnerability and identifying effective local \nmanagement actions to build resilience of and mitigate \nimpacts to protected areas is of utmost importance. \nHowever, for these special places to retain the val-\nues for which they were recognized, and to continue \nproviding benefits to the global community, immediate \nand significant action on the causes of climate change \nmust also be undertaken at national and international \nlevels.\nAuthor contributions\nJCD and SFH contributed equally to the development \nof the CVI; JCD wrote the first draft of the paper, with \nall authors contributing revisions. \nreferences \nBosson, J.B., Matthias Huss, and Elena Osipova. 2019.

    "abstract": "Aerosols are involved in a complex set of processes that operate across many spatial and temporal scales. Understanding these processes, and ensuring their accurate representation in models of transport, radiation transfer, and climate, requires knowledge of aerosol physical, chemical, and optical properties and the distributions of these properties in space and time. To derive aerosol climate forcing, aerosol optical and microphysical properties and their spatial and temporal distributions, and aerosol interactions with clouds, need to be understood. Such data are also required in conjunction with size-resolved chemical composition in order to evaluate chemical transport models and to distinguish natural and anthropogenic forcing. Other basic parameters needed for modeling the radiative influences of aerosols are surface reflectivity and three-dimensional cloud fields. This large suite of parameters mandates an integrated observing and modeling system of commensurate scope. The Progressive Aerosol Retrieval and Assimilation Global Observing Network (PARAGON) concept, designed to meet this requirement, is motivated by the need to understand climate system sensitivity to changes in atmospheric constituents, to reduce climate model uncertainties, and to analyze diverse collections of data pertaining to aerosols. This paper highlights several challenges resulting from the complexity of the problem. Approaches for dealing with them are offered in the set of companion papers",

Among its scientific\nmotivations is the need to establish, with great confi-\ndence, the magnitude of direct anthropogenic aero-\nsol influences on climate and the magnitude and sign\nof indirect aerosol\u2013cloud effects. Modeling of the in-\ndustrial era temperature record indicates that net\naerosol forcing is slightly less, but opposite in sign,\nthan forcing from anthropogenic greenhouse gases\n(GHGs). However, the uncertainties in aerosol direct\nand indirect anthropogenic forcing are of the same\nmagnitude as the effects themselves (Penner et al.\n2001; Ramaswamy et al. 2001), and are the dominant\nsources of uncertainty in current estimates of total an-\nthropogenic climate forcing. A major cause of uncer-\ntainty is the tremendous tropospheric aerosol variabil-\nity in space and time. On regional scales, aerosols can\nhave a much greater effect than GHGs, especially at\nthe earth\u2019s surface.\nAnthropogenic aerosol radiative forcing of climate\nchange has been assessed with forward radiative trans-\nfer calculations, constrained by the amount, distribu-\ntion, and properties of anthropogenic aerosols, and\nby inverse calculations, which infer anthropogenic\naerosol forcing by subtracting greenhouse gas and\nother known influences from the observed climate\nrecord over the industrial period.

Although\nsuch estimates of aerosol forcing are within the un-\ncertainty range of those calculated from the forward\napproach, the forward estimates are also consistent\nwith negative forcing (cooling) by aerosols that is as\nmuch as 3 times that inferred by the inverse approach\n(Anderson et al. 2003a). If aerosol forcing is that great,\nthe 0.6\u221eC rise in temperatures over the last century\nhas been driven by a rather small net positive forc-\ning, with the consequence that the earth\u2019s climate is\nmuch more sensitive than was previously thought.\nThe discrepancy between the uncertainty in forward\nand inverse models remains a key issue in predicting\nfuture climate response to increased concentrations\nof GHGs, making it critically important to improve\nand validate three-dimensional global models and to\ndevelop more realistic, physically based process rep-\nresentations. Systematic comparison with measure-\nments is the only known way to make models a reli-\nable basis for decisions regarding climate adaptation\nand mitigation. The PARAGON approach is pro-\nposed to make this possible. As the resolution of ob-\nservations and models improves, a corollary benefit\nwill be the establishment of a worldwide system for\nstudying the impacts of changing aerosol concentra-\ntions on air quality.\nMEASUREMENT NEEDS. Aerosols are involved\nin a myriad of processes, as is illustrated schematically\nin Fig. 1. Their properties are functions of the source\ntype, which determines initial composition; turbu-\nlence in the boundary layer, which controls mixing\nheight; relative humidity, which affects hygroscopic\ngrowth; and time since injection, which establishes the\nimportance of chemical processing, nucleation, con-\ndensation, coagulation, and deposition processes,\nsuch as sedimentation and precipitation. In the study\nof indirect effects, it is particularly important to sepa-\nrate aerosol influences on cloud droplets from dy-\nnamical effects associated with the local meteorology.\nThese processes operate across many spatial and tem-\nporal scales.\nAerosol properties needed for deriving aerosol cli-\nmate forcing include scattering and absorption coef-\nficients as functions of wavelength, particle size, scat-\ntering angle, relative humidity, and height;\nnumber\u2013size distribution; size-resolved chemical\ncomposition, including major ionic species, elemen-\ntal and organic carbon, mineral dust, and total mass;\nspectral optical depth; and number concentration,\nsize distribution, and chemical composition of cloud\ncondensation nuclei (CCN), as a function of super-\nsaturation. These variables are highly interdependent.\nFor example, satellite retrievals of optical depth are\nstrongly influenced by particle absorption, size dis-\ntribution, and shape.\nAerosol direct forcing results from the scattering\nand absorption of sunlight. The most important\naerosol radiative parameters are extinction coefficient\n(which, integrated over a vertical column, is the\noptical depth), single scattering albedo (the fraction\nof light extinction attributable to scattering), and\nasymmetry parameter (a measure of the angular dis-\ntribution of scattered light). Other basic parameters\nneeded are surface reflectivity and cloud cover.\nApportioning direct forcing be-\ntween natural and anthropogenic\nsources requires measurements of\nthe aerosol chemical composi-\ntion, with adequate size resolution\nto allow for the calculation of the\nlight scattering and absorption at-\ntributable to the various sources\n(e.g., dust, sea salt, biomass\nburning, and industrial emis-\nsions). Identification of trace\naerosol components, such as met-\nals and organic species, assists in\nevaluating the relative contribu-\ntions of natural and anthropogenic\nsources. The ability to distinguish\nanthropogenic from natural aero-\nsols also requires adequate knowl-\nedge of the background aerosol\nFIG. 1. The collection of processes represented in chemical and radia-\ntive aerosol models.\n1505OCTOBER 2004AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY |\nstate. Attempts to make this\ndistinction from global re-\nmote sensing data rely pri-\nmarily on particle sizing es-\ntimates (Kaufman et al.\n2002). However, the submi-\ncron tail of natural mineral\ndust size distributions, for\nexample, can comprise a sig-\nnificant fraction of the total\noptical depth. Aerosol size\ndistributions also evolve due\nto gravitational settling and\nprocessing by nonprec-\nipitating clouds. Estimates\nby Pruppacher and Jaenicke\n(1995) suggest that, on aver-\nage, aerosols are recycled\nthrough clouds three times\nbefore removal from the\natmosphere. Because back-\nground aerosol residence\ntimes and associated cloud\nrecycling events are quite uncertain and vary consid-\nerably with regional meteorology, separating anthro-\npogenic from natural aerosols based on size is com-\nplicated, and measurements must be augmented by\nmodels that are sophisticated enough to account for\ncloud formation and dissipation in conjunction with\ndetailed aerosol physics.\nAerosol indirect forcing results from the interac-\ntions of aerosols and clouds. Changes in aerosol com-\nposition and concentration lead to changes in the\nnumber and size of cloud droplets, which alter cloud\nreflectivity, lifetime, and resulting precipitation.\nStatistical relationships between aerosol loading and\ncloud properties have been derived from Advanced\nVery High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)\n(Nakajima et al. 2001) and Polarization and Direc-\ntionality of the Earth\u2019s Reflectances (POLDER) data\n(Br\u00e9on et al. 2002). Studies have shown that aerosols\ncan suppress precipitation in smoke from biomass\nburning (Rosenfeld 1999), urban and industrial pol-\nlution (Rosenfeld 2000), and desert dust (Rosenfeld\net al. 2001). On the other hand, large sea-salt particles\ncan enhance precipitation (Feingold et al. 1999;\nRudich et al. 2002; Rosenfeld et al. 2002). Key mea-\nsurements that are needed to quantify aerosol indi-\nrect forcing include the size distribution and chemi-\ncal composition of particles that form cloud droplets\n(i.e., CCN), as a function of their supersaturation\nenvironment, as well as the resulting size distribution\nof the cloud droplets.\nMeasurements of key parameters must meet strin-\ngent stability and absolute accuracy standards to\nachieve the desired confidence in aerosol radiative\nforcing of better than 1 W m-2. For example, Ohring\net al. (2004) identified accuracy requirements of \u00b10.01\nfor aerosol optical depth and \u00b10.03 for single scatter-\ning albedo, with specified stabilities of one-half these\nvalues per decade. Accuracy improvements and new\ndata are necessary to tackle increasingly difficult prob-\nlems, such as indirect forcing. Figure 2 illustrates the\ndesired progression in capability.\nTECHNICAL AND PRACTICAL CHAL-\nLENGES. To acquire and use data of sufficient qual-\nity for aerosol research, the complex, multidisci-\nplinary nature of the problems must be addressed. We\nidentify four challenges to meeting measurement re-\nquirements and building a cohesive dataset.\nData diversity. Three basic approaches have been taken\nto determining aerosol properties: in situ observa-\ntions, remote sensing, and three-dimensional nu-\nmerical modeling. No single, known approach can\ncapture all of the essential information at all relevant\nscales. In situ observations from aircraft and surface\ninstruments can provide the aerosol mass concentra-\ntion and its vertical distribution, the aerosol chemi-\ncal composition, the spectral scattering coefficient,\ninformation on aerosol hygroscopic growth, and the\nspectral single scattering albedo as inferred from sepa-\nFIG. 2. The evolution of aerosol research and associated measurement needs.\nCapabilities accumulate from left to right.\n1506 OCTOBER 2004|\nrate measurements of scattering and absorption (or\nextinction) coefficients. Intensive field campaigns\nproduce detailed characterizations of aerosol proper-\nties at a few sites over brief intervals, and can yield\ninformation on processes involved in chemical and\nmicrophysical aerosol evolution. Surface networks\ngenerally provide less comprehensive measurements,\nbut cover much longer periods of time. They contain\nradiometers to measure spectral aerosol optical depth\nand estimate column-averaged aerosol size distribu-\ntion, phase function, and single scattering albedo;\nlidar systems to measure the vertical distribution of\naerosols; and chemical sampling and monitoring\nstations. Satellite imaging radiometers measure re-\ngional and global radiances, from which both aero-\nsol optical and microphysical properties, along with\nradiative fluxes, can be derived. Satellites provide the\nmost practical means to track long-range airmass trans-\nport, and to identify a spatial and temporal context (e.g.,\naerosol source locations). Three-dimensional atmo-\nspheric models allow estimates of aerosol radiative forc-\ning from predicted or measured aerosol distributions.\nThe critical objective of addressing data diversity\nis to provide a comprehensive and validated physi-\ncal, chemical, and optical description of the global\naerosol system by bringing together quality-\ncontrolled data from multiple sources. So many do-\nmestic and international agencies sponsor data gen-\neration, however, that lines of responsibility and a\nprotocol for merging data and verifying quality must\nbe established.\nData quality limitations. Climate studies require greater\nconsistency among observations and models than that\nwhich currently exists. Consider the instantaneous\naerosol optical depth required to obtain a forcing of\n1 W m-2. Using a daily average top-of-atmosphere\n(TOA) aerosol forcing in the absence of clouds of\n~30 W m-2 per unit optical depth at midvisible wave-\nlengths (Charlson et al. 1991; Boucher et al. 1998),\nfactoring in 60% cloud cover, and accounting for only\nhalf the earth being in sunlight, this optical depth is\nabout 0.04, comparable to the uncertainty quoted for\nindividual satellite systems, and considerably smaller\nthan the scatter among five remote sensing ap-\nproaches (Myhre et al. 2004) and between models and\nobservations (Penner et al. 2002). For example, based\non the examination of systematic and random errors,\nWagener et al. (1997) concluded that the uncertainty\nin 1\u221e spatial averages of AVHRR aerosol optical depth\nretrievals at 0.64 mm over the ocean was about\n0.03\u00b133%. Recent analyses of radiances from the Terra\nMultiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) and\nModerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer\n(MODIS) illustrate that even small (~3%) biases in ra-\ndiometric calibration translate into optical depth uncer-\ntainties of a few hundredths (Bruegge et al. 2004; Kahn\net al. 2004). On the theoretical side, atmospheric mod-\nels calculate the relative amounts of natural and an-\nthropogenic aerosols from available emission invento-\nries, and hygroscopic growth is assumed or calculated\nbased on laboratory data and assumed aerosol compo-\nsition. From these inputs, both the single scattering al-\nbedo and angular scattering function are calculated\nfrom idealized optical models. Uncertainties in these\ninputs propagate into estimates of forcing.\nTracking trends in aerosol properties and assess-\ning model performance requires a long-term record\nwith a sustained, self-consistent accuracy. Future sat-\nellites, for example, the National Polar-orbiting Op-\nerational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS),\nwill provide some ingredients of a complete space-\nbased measurement system, though other components,\nsuch as systematic satellite aerosol vertical distribu-\ntions measurements, are absent. The National Aero-\nnautics and Space Administration\u2019s (NASA\u2019s) satellite\nmissions can demonstrate new measurement capabili-\nties and can even test particular hypotheses; but, these\nshort-term missions, carrying different sensors em-\nploying a variety of techniques, make it difficult to iden-\ntify climate trends. In addition, long-term suborbital\naerosol observations are needed to link satellite- and\nsurface-based radiometer and lidar retrieval algorithms\nand the output of chemical transport models (CTMs).\nAerosol mesoscale variability. Spatial and temporal vari-\nability are the primary causes of the large uncertainty\nin aerosol climate forcing calculations. Tropospheric\naerosol amounts and physical and chemical proper-\nties are variable on temporal and spatial scales much\nsmaller than those of well-mixed greenhouse gases,\nsuch as CO2. This is one reason it is so difficult to\nquantify anthropogenic aerosol impacts on the cli-\nmate system. Changes in aerosol distribution over\ntime, caused, for example, by industrialization, urban-\nization, deforestation, or regional environmental con-\ntrols, complicate our ability to predict aerosol climatic\neffects. Thus, a detailed understanding of processes\nand feedbacks, and the capacity to quantify them on\nscales spanning orders of magnitude in time and\nspace, are needed.\nComparisons among in situ measurements, satel-\nlite data, and atmospheric chemical transport model\npredictions, raise important practical issues.\nAnderson et al. (2003b) demonstrated that although\nthere is little variability on scales less than 20 km, and\n1507OCTOBER 2004AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY |\nfor temporal offsets less than about 3 h, a rapid in-\ncrease in variability occurs over scales from 20 to a\nfew hundred kilometers (see also Benkovitz et al.\n1994). This is consistent with the mesoscale nature\nof dust storms, biomass fires, and megacity plumes\n(major aerosol sources) and precipitation (a major\naerosol sink). All of these examples have physical di-\nmensions around 20\u2013200 km. Aerosol plumes exist\non the airmass scale (from several hundred to a few\nthousand kilometers), but they are not internally ho-\nmogeneous. Their mesoscale inhomogeneity is due\nmainly to horizontal mixing times that are slow, com-\npared to aerosol residence times in the lower tropo-\nsphere; and nonuniform vertical mixing in the pres-\nence of large vertical concentration gradients may\nalso play a role.\nThe performance of CTMs needs to be evaluated\nnot just in terms of how well they predict average\naerosol concentrations, but also how well they rep-\nresent variability. Because mesoscale aerosol variabil-\nity is generally not resolved by global CTMs, models\nusing horizontal grid cells of 100 km or more have\nto account for subgrid-scale variations and correla-\ntions. It is critical to understand the processes rel-\nevant on temporal scales of hours or less and spatial\nscales smaller than the grid cells of CTMs and gen-\neral circulation models (GCMs). For example, many\nmodels handle horizontal transport in the free tro-\nposphere well, but do not adequately resolve verti-\ncal uplift from the boundary layer to the free tropo-\nsphere. Consequently, a practical framework for\nmerging data acquired over a wide span of spatial and\ntemporal scales is required. Correlations between\nsatellite data and in situ data on the relevant scales\nalso need to be explored, along with closure studies\nof statistical distributions derived from the respec-\ntive measurements. Spatial and temporal sampling\nmust be taken into account; for example, surface\nchemical samples accumulated on a 24-h or longer\nbasis do not always represent instantaneous aerosol\nproperties measured from satellites. Currently, the\nlack of in situ data aloft is one major limitation to ex-\nploring these key processes.\nCloud ubiquity and heterogeneity. To determine direct\naerosol forcing from measurements, clouds must be\nscreened effectively in the aerosol retrieval process.\nScattered light from nearby clouds, and the effects of\nsubpixel clouds, are most effectively dealt with\nthrough high spatial resolution observations\n(kilometer-scale or better, with at least one channel\nobserving at a few hundred meters). To date, the spa-\ntial resolution of spaceborne near-ultraviolet and po-\nlarimetric data is at least an order of magnitude\ncoarser. Available techniques for screening thick cir-\nrus include using spectral observations within strong\ngaseous absorptions (Gao et al. 2002); thresholding\ntechniques that rely on one-, two-, or higher-dimen-\nsional clustering of TOA visible and infrared window\nradiances (e.g., Platt 1983; Minnis and Harrison 1984;\nArking and Childs 1985; Seze and Desbois 1987;\nStowe et al. 1988); clustering of the TOA infrared\nwindow radiance and its spatial variability (Coakley\nand Bretherton 1982); a multiangle band-differenced\nmethod (Di Girolamo and Davies 1994); and stereo\nimaging (Moroney et al. 2002; Zong et al. 2002). Thin\ncirrus can be observed with simple backscatter lidars\nand may also be inferred as a component of a\nmultimodal aerosol retrieval.\nTo evaluate indirect forcing over the entire globe,\nnatural cloud variability and possible correlations\nwith anthropogenic aerosols must be taken into ac-\ncount. As an example, in the eastern United States,\nsoutherly winds advect pollution, moisture, and cloud\nfields, whereas clean, dry cloudless air tends to be as-\nsociated with winds from the north. The resulting\nintrinsic correlation between cloudiness and pollution\naffects efforts to isolate indirect aerosol effects. In\naddition, meteorological variability tends to mask\nsmall aerosol signals in cloud properties, so a long-\nterm record of remotely sensed cloud properties,\nalong with aerosol observations, is needed to separate\nthese contributions. The following variables are im-\nportant: liquid water content, liquid water path\n(LWP), cloud geometrical thickness and height, cloud\ndroplet number concentration, effective radius, and\ncloud lifetime. In general, details of low-cloud and\nvertical aerosol structure are important when evalu-\nating long-term changes in cloud properties. Lidars\nneed to supplement passive techniques in order to\ndisentangle cloud adjacency effects and to study aero-\nsols above and below clouds. Cloud type changes rap-\nidly on subkilometer spatial scales, and the prevalent\ncloud heterogeneity (Genkova and Davies 2003) leads\nto biased cloud optical depth retrievals when based\non one-dimensional radiative transfer theory (Loeb\nand Coakley 1998; Horv\u00e1th and Davies 2004).\nHorv\u00e1th and Davies (2004), in particular, show that\nat a spatial resolution of 1 km, one-dimensional mod-\nels match observed multiangular radiances within\n\u00b15% for only about 20% of the global distribution of\nclouds. This implies that inferences of cloud water\ncontent from radiances require three-dimensional\nradiative transfer theory for most of the earth\u2019s cloud\nfields. Measurements by ground-based (Kim et al.\n2003) and satellite (Harshvardhan et al. 2002) remote\n1508 OCTOBER 2004|\nsensing show that cloud LWP exhibits variability on\nscales of kilometers and minutes, even for the low\nstratiform clouds of intermediate optical thickness\nthat are most susceptible to aerosol indirect effects.\nSo, changing LWP, which is one of the major factors\naffecting cloud optical depth variability, must be\nquantified as part of the aerosol indirect effect mea-\nsurements, and satellite observations targeting this re-\nsearch area require higher spatial resolution than is\nneeded to study aerosol direct effects alone.\nCONCLUSIONS. Achieving measurement com-\npleteness and accuracy sufficient to separate the natu-\nral and anthropogenic aerosol influences on climate,\nand acquiring sufficient understanding with which\nto disentangle aerosol direct and indirect forcings,\nrepresent scientific problems of great complexity.\nUnambiguous attribution of causes and effects de-\nmands measurement accuracies that, in some cases,\nrequire developments beyond the current state of the\nart. Furthermore, the suite of interdependent vari-\nables that needs to be observed or modeled is large,\nand the physical and chemical processes involved\nspan many orders of magnitude in time and space.\nThese factors necessitate an integrated observing and\nmodeling system of commensurate scope. An orga-\nnized, systematic, and integrated approach, such as\nthat embodied by the PARAGON initiative, offers the\nbest chance of overcoming challenges related to the\ncomplexity of the problems being addressed and for\nresolving practical issues arising from the multi-\ndisciplinary nature of the science.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS.

Laurmann, Div. of AppL Mech., Stanford Univ.,\nLong Term Objectives\nclimatologically significant statistical properties of\nthe atmospheric component of the climate system.\nUnderstanding should lead to an ability to correctly\nand efficiently incorporate this component into larger\nmodels for climate that include oceanic and cryospheric\ninfluences and deal realistically with climate replica-\ntion. An immediately usefully and critically important\nconsequence of successful completion of the study would\nbe the ability to assess the magnitude of the unpredict-\nable (noise) component of long term atmospheric behav-\nior, and hence the potential for viable climatological\nforecasting.\nImmediate Program Content And Objectives\nThe Stanford program in climate is new and in proc-\ness of development. Both because of the relative nov-\nelty of our approach to the problem and because our\nstudents have minimal backgrounds in meteorology and\natmospheric sciences, we have elected to start at a\nsimple but fundamental level of analysis. Thus, the\ninitial effort is concentrating on the use of Lorenz's\n\"minimum hydrodynamic equations\" as a prototype for\ndescribing at least some of the non-llnear characteris,\ntics of long term atmospheric behavior that we believe\nare important for climate. We have two main thoughts\nin mind:\na) that techniques for closure of the moment equa-\n_tions that arise from treatingtime averaged\nclimatic variables can be tested with the mini-\nmum equations. These do indeed exhibit the\ncounter-gradlent momentum transfer and vacilla-\n347\nhttps://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19790012520 2020-03-20T18:29:29+00:00Z\nand\ntory behaviors that are known as essential\nfeatures on thg non-linear behavior of the\natmosphere;\nb) in view of the fact that temporal response\ncharacteristics need to be known for developing\natmospheric climate models, it is hoped that\nstudy of such properties of the minimum equa-\ntions (hopefully with only minor modifications)\nwill lead to a rationale for simplified atmos-\npheric climate models via a subdivision into\nmore easily treated sub-components. For exam-\nple, we might consider long term, large scale\nchanges to be describable in terms of a baro-\ntropic model that is driven baroclinically, per-\nhaps by stochastic forcing via quasi-geostroph-\nic turbulence, as well as by deterministic\nterms. The minimum equations would represent\nthe simplest possible description for the baro-\ntropic component of such a model.\nAccomplishments\nWe are advocating the introduction of time\naveraging for the treatment of climate questions. The\napproximations that then become possible (and, we\nsuggest, necessary for practical viability of answering\nclimate problems) will vary with the averaging time\nselected, which in term will vary with the particular\nclimate question being addressed. In every case, how-\never, the averaging process, when applied to the (non-\nlinear) differential equations governing atmospheric\nmotions, introduces new, statistically defined varia-\nbles (moments and correlations) which are formally\ngoverned by an infinite set of equations. For large\nscale motions conventional turbulence theory approaches\nfor closing these equations do not apply, and for the\nclimatological case we must resort to other techniques,\nthe nature of which we expect to discover only from\nbetter understanding of the atmospheric circulation\nsystem itself. The simplest model that incorporates\nthe important counter-gradient transport of momentum,\nnecessary for the maintenance of the atmospheric energy\ncycle, is represented in Lorenz's introduction of the\n\"minimum hydrodynamic\" system of equations. These re-\npresent the first three Fourier modes of a standing\nwave system for a rectangular domain, with B effect\nneglected, and their solution (available analytically)\ndescribes the temporal non-linear oscillations of the\nstanding waves. The equations governing the time-\n348\nvariation of the amplitudes of the three wave compon-\nents, AI, A2, A3, are\ndA I dA 2 dA 3\n-- = CIAIA 2 ; - C2AIA 3 ; - C3A2A I ; (i)dt dt dt\nwhere CI . _ [_(_3 + i)]-i _ C2 = 2( 2 + i)-i ,\nC3 = _ ( 2 _ 1)/2a , and a = k/Z , the ratio of zonal\nto meridional wave number.

It is this (infinite) system\nof equations that we need to solve for the climate case,\nand since the solutions (4) can be used to calculate\nthe moments (5) exactly for the minimum equations, we\nare in position to evaluate the accuracy of any pro-\nposed closure scheme, at least as far as the properties\nof the minimum equations are concerned. Exact moments,\nfor arbitrary values of averaging time T can in fact\nbe derived in analytic, though rather cumbersome form,\nand this has been done up to the third order moments\nTijk\nA possible approach for achieving approximate\nclosure that has worked well in the case of stochastic\ndynamics weather forecasting, is linearisation of the\nmoment equations. In our case, the linearisation would\nbe made about an assumed known climatic state, which,\nfor problems of the first kind would be based on ob-\nserved records over the period 0 > t > -T , and, for\nprediction of the second kind, would correspond to\nclimatological mean estimates of statistically sta-\ntionary states. Note that in the second case we need\nto treat ensemble as well as temporal means, as situa-\ntion which leads to complications in the development of\nthe moment equations which we are starting to look into.\nTests on the efficacy of this concept of a linearised\napproximation are now being carried out by numerical\nsolution of truncated forms of the (linearised) moment\nequations.\nHowever, for the minimum equations we have discov-\nered an unexpected property that indeed seems to ob-\nviate the need for devises such as linearisation for\nclosing the moment equations.

With the incorporation of peatlands, global climate models will be able to simulate the fate of northern peatland carbon under climate change, and estimate the magnitude and strength of any climate system feedbacks associated with the dynamics of this large carbon pool.1. INTRODUCTIONA substantial amount of carbon has accumulated as peat (partially decomposed organic matter) in northern peatlands or mires through the Holocene [Gorham, 1991]. This carbon is situated on what we can think of as two thermodynamic state boundaries that are strongly controlled by the both the climate system and the peatlands themselves. Both of these 20 INCORPORATING NORTHERN PEATLANDS INTO GLOBAL CLIMATE MODELSstate boundaries have a very strong influence on the fate of peatland carbon; will it remain as peat or be transformed into dissolved or particulate organic matter or into gaseous CO2 or CH4, and if transformed, how rapidly will this occur?For carbon in many northern peatlands, one of these state boundaries is the solid/liquid phase boundary of water at 0\u00b0C. A significant fraction of northern peatlands are under-lain or embedded in permafrost (perennially frozen ground which lies below a surface active layer that seasonally thaws and is generally less than 1 m thick). In Canada, more than one third of peatlands have permafrost [Tarnocai, 2006]. Smith et al. [2007] estimated that about one third of northern peatlands are in zones of continuous permafrost, with an-other 40% of northern peatlands in discontinuous, sporadic, and isolated permafrost zones. Organic carbon in permafrost is relatively inert both physically and biogeochemically while frozen, although laboratory incubations have shown that microbial metabolism and methane production can occur, albeit at very low rates, at temperatures well below 0\u00b0C [Brouchkov and Fukuda, 2002; Rivkina et al., 2004]. However, any gas produced by this slow metabolic activity will remain within the permafrost because diffusive gas loss from permafrost is negligible [Rivkina et al., 2004, 2007]. A number of studies have established that the old organic mat-ter frozen into permafrost readily decomposes if thawed and that microbial populations that can decompose the organic matter are present and viable in the permafrost [Rivkina et al., 1998, 2004, 2007; Zimov et al., 2006].Warming in recent decades has been stronger at high northern latitudes than in the rest of the world [Serreze and Francis, 2006], a trend that is projected to continue [Meehl et al., 2007], and this will affect permafrost. Zhang et al. [2006] used a soil physics model to estimate that the area underlain by permafrost in Canada decreased by ~5% from 1850 to 1990. Yi et al. [2006, 2007] used the land module of a general circulation model (GCM) to simulate permafrost dynamics under warming for discontinuous and continuous permafrost sites and a range of soil properties. Their results were sensitive to surface cover and soil properties, with sur-face peat substantially slowing the rate of thaw. Lawrence et al. [2008] also included organic soils in their land sur-face model; they found that organic soils slowed the rate of permafrost thawing but, nonetheless, projected a significant decline in near-surface permafrost during the 21st century, using a GCM forced by a strong warming scenario (+7.5\u00b0 over Arctic land during 1900\u20132100). If frozen peat thaws, it will become more readily decomposable, and both it and any decomposition products will become much more susceptible to loss to the atmosphere, leaching or thermokarst erosion. On the other hand, if permafrost develops or expands in a northern peatland (perhaps due to a drying-induced change in peat thermal properties), the peat that freezes will become less susceptible to decomposition or transport.The second state boundary is biogeochemical, the bound-ary between oxia and anoxia. Peatland water table depth is the first-order control of the partitioning of the peat profile into aerobic and anaerobic zones. A peatland\u2019s water table is generally within 0.5 m of the peat surface, and this rela-tively stable, high water table is a result of both the climate and topographic setting and the hydrological properties of the peat itself. Above the water table, the peat is generally oxic, while below the water table, it is generally anoxic. This anoxia affects the decomposition pathways of organic mat-ter, both by slowing its overall rate relative to aerobic de-composition and generating reduced carbon compounds as intermediate- and end-products, including methane (CH4), a strong greenhouse gas. The relative proportion of CO2 and CH4 in carbon gas losses from peatlands has important climate consequences due to their different radiative im-pacts [e.g., Laine et al., 1996; Whiting and Chanton, 2001; Minkkinen et al., 2002; Frolking et al., 2006]. Water table depth is a direct expression of peatland hydrology and is strongly influenced by precipitation, peat hydraulic prop-erties, and a peatland\u2019s hydrologic setting within a larger watershed.A third factor affecting the fate of peat in northern peat-lands is locational; almost all peatland carbon is within sev-eral meters of the atmosphere, some peat (i.e., that in fens) is also well-integrated into regional hydrological flow paths, and little of the peat is physically isolated in mineral soil aggregates or adsorbed onto mineral surfaces, which can shelter the organic matter from decomposing organisms and reduce its sensitivity to climate change [Davidson and Jans-sens, 2006; Trumbore and Czimczik, 2008]. In this way peat, though technically soil carbon, is more similar to a vegeta-tion carbon pool. If the peat carbon is mobilized through decomposition or erosion/dissolution, gaseous forms will likely enter the atmosphere, and in some peatland systems, dissolved or particulate organic matter or dissolved inor-ganic carbon will likely flow out of the peatland and further down the drainage network [e.g., Moore, this volume].All biogeochemical cycling in vegetation/soil systems is sensitive to climate change through temperature, soil moisture, and other climatic controls on cycling rates and metabolic activity. These direct sensitivities are generally considered to be nonlinear but smoothly varying responses that are relatively small for small changes in climate. The nature of the physical and biogeochemical state boundaries on which much northern peat is poised means that the fate of the large northern peatland carbon pool may be very sensi-tive to relatively small changes in climate. Northern peatland geographic location ensures that it will experience climate FROLkING ET AL. 21change earlier and more rapidly than many other biomes [Christensen et al., 2007], and peat\u2019s position at the soil sur-face means that any response in terms of carbon mobiliza-tion and greenhouse gas emissions will rapidly influence the climate system.Global climate models are needed to provide the best avail-able representations of future climate for assessing the fate of the large pool of carbon in northern peatlands, and those representations will improve if climate feedback effects that can be generated by the dynamics of northern peatlands are included explicitly and if the local climate temperature and moisture conditions of northern peatlands are modeled directly. In other words, climate change projections should be more accurate if the next generation of coupled climate- carbon Earth system models [e.g., Friedlingstein et al., 2006] include northern peatlands as a specific terrestrial bi-ome with some unique properties.2. DEVELOPMENTS OF COUPLED CARBON- CLIMATE MODELS, WITH REPRESENTATION  OF ECOSYSTEMSOver the past several decades, as atmosphere-ocean GCMs have developed in complexity, and as computational power has increased, the land surface representation in these mod-els has gone from a simple bulk surface representation of albedo, aerodynamic roughness, and soil moisture availabil-ity to more explicit modeling of the hydrological cycle and to partitioning energy, and water fluxes between the ground and vegetation [Sellers et al., 1997]. Further developments have included layered soils and plant physiological control over canopy stomatal conductance [Sellers et al., 1997; Le Treut et al., 2007; Bonan, 2008].In the last several years, explicit treatment of the carbon cycle and vegetation dynamics has been incorporated into some GCMs; in these models, the biosphere and atmosphere operate as a coupled system [Cox et al., 2000; Friedlingstein et al., 2006; Le Treut et al., 2007; Randall et al., 2007; Bonan, 2008]. This coupling of the carbon and climate cycles into a single dynamic model has demonstrated the importance of modeling the inherent feedbacks between the climate system and the carbon cycle because they can substantially change the climate response to anthropogenic forcing of greenhouse gas concentrations [e.g., Cox et al., 2000]. The carbon cy-cle component of these coupled models typically considers a few to about 20 different plant functional types and several plant and soil carbon pools. The plant functional types can be dynamic (i.e., redistribute geographically due to quasi-competitive responses to climate change) or static. Soil car-bon pools are spun up to be in approximate equilibrium with the climate forcing (without explicit consideration of peat-lands), and their dynamics during the simulation are con-trolled by inputs (vegetation productivity and litterfall) and output (decomposition losses), both responding to changing temperature and moisture conditions.In an early work, Cox et al. [2000] found that carbon cy-cle feedbacks on the climate system had a positive feedback on warming because climate warming/drying led to the col-lapse of wet neotropical forest ecosystems and a large net flux of carbon from the land surface to the atmosphere. More recently, an intercomparison was conducted with 11 coupled carbon-climate models (both GCMs and Earth system mod-els of intermediate complexity (EMICs)) using historical an-thropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and a future emissions scenario (A2) developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emissions Sce-narios (SRES). All model results indicated that increasing CO2 concentrations alone would enhance the rate at which CO2 was taken up by both the land and ocean (a negative feedback), but that the climate change reduced the rate at which CO2 is removed from the atmosphere [Friedlingstein et al., 2006]. However, the model results exhibited substan-tial variability in their quantification of the strengths of these feedbacks, and in the relative importance of the land and ocean [Friedlingstein et al., 2006]. The models had a range of representations of the terrestrial carbon cycle, some with dynamic vegetation models and some without, but none in-cluded peatlands as a possible land cover type. In the recent coupled carbon-climate cycle modeling study of Yoshikawa et al. [2008], the two northern regions identified as having strong system feedbacks, Siberia and western boreal North America, are also regions where a substantial fraction of the landscape is peatlands [e.g., Wieder et al., 2006]. The terres-trial ecosystem component of this coupled carbon-climate system model [Ito and Oikawa, 2002] has general represen-tations of plant and soil functioning, but no specific repre-sentation of unique characteristics of peatlands (see section 4 below).Incorporating peatlands and their carbon cycling into cou-pled carbon-climate models poses a number of challenges (see section 4 below). Any representation of peatland carbon cycling will have to comply with strict water, energy, and carbon conservation constraints that are imposed by global climate models for climate change integrations. Another requirement is global applicability (e.g., regionally specific solutions should be avoided). There is an additional, more philosophical modeling goal; limit the amount of informa-tion, such as surface data sets (e.g., a wetland map) that are prespecified and not permitted to evolve with the rest of the Earth system.GCMs are computationally demanding, and typical simu-lations are for periods of hundreds of years or less. This 22 INCORPORATING NORTHERN PEATLANDS INTO GLOBAL CLIMATE MODELSis long enough to simulate many issues relevant to peat-lands as part of the coupled carbon-climate system (e.g., weather-driven interannual variability in C balances; im-pacts on the peatland C cycle of drought, fire, pollution, harvest or climate change). However, radiocarbon dating of peat cores shows that most sites have been accumulat-ing peat (carbon) persistently for millennia [e.g., Turunen et al., 2002; Yu et al., 2003; Smith et al., 2004]. During this time, the peatlands have not been static; for any peat-land, there may have been variations or changes in veg-etation cover, hydrological status, peat depth, and peat (C) accumulation rate [e.g., Yu et al., 2003]. At this time, GCM groups are not running continuous simulations for several millennia, though they may be within another decade or less, though probably not as a regular prac-tice. However, several EMICS have been developed that include many GCM processes in simplified or parameterized forms that substantially reduce computation time [Claussen et al., 2002]. These models have been designed for a number of applications, including paleoclimatic reconstructions of the Holocene. Both the CLIMBER-2 model [Brovkin et al., 2002, 2008] and the McGill paleoclimate model [Wang et al., 2005] have done Holocene climate-carbon cycle simu-lations. Neither explicitly included peatlands.Spatial resolution of GCM simulations has decreased to-ward ~100-km grid cells [Le Treut et al., 2007], and repre-sentation of subgrid heterogeneity, characterized as a mosaic of tiles, each with a different land cover, is now common though not universal [Pitman, 2003]. Surface energy, water, and carbon fluxes are calculated on each tile before being aggregated and passed to an atmospheric submodel. EMICS have variable spatial resolutions for their representations of the atmosphere, oceans, and land, generally coarser than GCMs. The land representation in CLIMBER-2 was ~10\u00b0 latitude \u00d7 50\u00b0 longitude, or ~1000 km \u00d7 5000 km [Brovkin et al., 2002], and for the McGill paleoclimate model, it was ~5\u00b0 \u00d7 5\u00b0 [Wang et al., 2005]. Both GCM and EMIC spatial resolutions present a challenge for representing land surface heterogeneity in vegetation cover, soils, topography, biogeo-chemical processes, and human management, which occur at scales from <1 m to >106 m.Although the steady growth in computational resources has permitted global models to keep advancing to finer spatial resolution, the resolution is still not fine enough to address fine-scale variability evident in northern peatlands (i.e., variability over scales of 1\u201310,000 m) [Baird et al., this volume]. For even the highest resolution GCMs, the degree of subgrid surface heterogeneity remains large, especially in the northern high latitudes. To a certain degree, heterogene-ity in surface cover has been accounted for by grid cell tiling of vegetation cover. By comparison, soils are treated much more homogeneously. Typically, all vegetation types within a grid cell [for example, up to four plant functional types in a standard configuration for the National Center for Atmos-pheric Research Community Land Model (CLM)] share the same nonheterogeneous soil column. Wetland distribution is typically either prescribed, based on satellite or other glo-bal wetland distribution estimates, or is defined as the frac-tion of the water table that intersects the surface which is a function of mean grid cell water table depth and surface topography [Gedney et al., 2004; Niu et al., 2005]. Peatlands are typically ignored, or as in Lawrence and Slater [2008] represented without regard to spatial heterogeneity across a grid cell. In global carbon cycle models used in GCMs, there is sometimes no relationship between soil carbon, which is a grid cell level quantity, and wetlands, which is a diagnostic quantity that is a function of the grid cell water balance and surface topography.3. NORTHERN PEATLANDS IN THE COUPLED  CLIMATE-CARBON SYSTEMNorthern peatlands, like other terrestrial ecosystems, in-fluence the Earth\u2019s climate system through their impact on the land-surface energy balance. Land-surface albedo and roughness are direct functions of vegetation community composition and landscape heterogeneity (e.g., fraction that is open water). The surface energy balance partitioning of the net radiation energy inputs into sensible and latent heat fluxes also depends on the nature of the surface and vegeta-tion cover and on the availability of evaporable water on the vegetation and in the soil.Northern peatlands, again like other terrestrial systems, also influence the Earth\u2019s climate through their impact on the composition of the atmosphere, particularly the greenhouse gases CO2 and CH4. Northern peatlands have been a persist-ent atmospheric CO2 sink for millennia (0.02\u20130.03 kg C m\u20132 a\u20131 over the long term [Gorham, 1995; Tolonen et al., 1992; Smith et al., 2004]). About 250\u2013400 Pg C is sequestered in ~3\u20134 million km2 of northern peatlands [Gorham, 1991; Turunen et al., 2002]. It is not known if, overall, northern peatlands still sequester C at that rate; multiyear site mea-surements show a variable annual C balance and generally a net uptake [Lafleur et al., 2003; Aurela et al., 2002; Roulet et al., 2007; Nilsson et al., 2008].Northern peatlands are currently also a source of ~10\u201340 Tg CH4 a\u20131 [Prather et al., 2001] and, along with tropical wetlands, likely emitted a large fraction of global total meth-ane flux through the Holocene, when the anthropogenic sources that dominate current budgets were small to neg-ligible. Peatland methane emissions are strongly related to hydrology [Bubier et al., 1995; Waddington et al., 1996; FROLkING ET AL. 23MacDonald et al., 1998], net primary productivity [Whiting and Chanton, 1993; Waddington et al., 1996], and vegeta-tion composition [Bubier, 1995; King et al., 1998; Joabsson et al., 1999]. All of these factors are interrelated, and they interact to control methane fluxes [e.g., Treat et al., 2007], so predictions based on any one factor inevitably have a lim-ited range of application.Frolking and Roulet [2007] have shown that the net fluxes of CO2 and CH4 from northern peatlands through the Holocene were large enough to influence the global climate system. They estimated a contemporary radiative forcing impact of about \u20130.4 W m\u20132 (a net cooling) as a result of the effect that peatland development through the Holocene has on the current atmospheric burdens of CO2 and CH4. Current peatland carbon content, accumulated over the past ~10,000 years, is roughly equivalent to 100\u2013200 ppmv CO2 in the atmosphere (~25\u201350%), so simulations of Holo-cene climate dynamics should include a representation of peatlands as a significant component of the global carbon cycle.Peatlands are generally viewed as sluggish, slowly evolv-ing, self-stabilizing ecosystems [e.g., Charman, 2002] and, under relatively stable climatic conditions, their large carbon pool as relatively inert [e.g., Clymo, 1984]. However, rela-tively rapid changes in peatland vegetation and net carbon fluxes are possible; these changes include fire burning for hours to months [Turetsky et al., 2004], industrial harvest occurring over weeks to years [e.g., Tuittila et al., 2003; Petrone et al., 2001], permafrost thaw/collapse occurring over years to decades [e.g., Camill et al., 2001; Malmer et al., 2005; Johansson et al., 2006; Wickland et al., 2006], decadal changes in vegetation composition\u2014including tree encroachment attributed to gradual drying and N-deposition as well as internal or autogenic processes [e.g., Gunnarsson et al., 2000], drainage/drought impacts occurring over years to decades [e.g., Laine et al., 1995; Minkkinen et al., 1999, 2002], and pollution inputs and related vegetation changes over years to decades [e.g., Bobbink et al., 1998]. All of these factors are likely to change over the coming century with changes in climate, atmospheric chemistry, and human activ-ity. Through destabilization, disturbance, or other changes in ecosystem structure or physiology, the carbon in peatlands can be released to the atmosphere as CO2, CO, and/or CH4 or can transfer as dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and/or particulate organic carbon downstream. Even without dis-turbance/destabilization, the net carbon balance of northern peatlands is expected to change with climate change, but the nature, magnitude, and even the sign of that change is uncertain [Moore et al., 1998; Gorham, 1991]. Since chang-ing fluxes of CO2 and CH4 from northern peatlands will affect the climate system, the best way to model these feed-back loops is to incorporate peatlands directly into a climate model.4. NORTHERN PEATLAND ECOSYSTEM  PROPERTIES THAT WILL REQUIRE NEW  CLIMATE MODEL DEVELOPMENTSWetlands differ from other terrestrial landscapes due to the presence of water at or near the soil surface for most or all of the year, soils that frequently have limited oxygen content, and specialized plants that are able to grow in these conditions. Peatlands (or mires, in Europe) are a subclass of wetlands that have substantial accumulations of partially de-composed plant detritus at the soil surface [Charman, 2002; Rydin and Jeglum, 2006; Wieder and Vitt, 2006; Mitsch and Gosselink, 2007]. Modeling peatland carbon cycling, as a stand-alone model or within a regional ecosystem/biogeo-chemistry model or GCM, requires special attention to sev-eral unique peatland properties related to soil physics and hydrology, landscape spatial heterogeneity, vegetation phys-iology, and ecosystem biogeochemistry (Table 1).4.1. SoilTo be classified as a peatland, there must be a surface layer of organic soil or peat that is at least 0.3 m (United States) or 0.4 m (Canada) thick; typically, peat depths are one to several meters but may exceed 10 m. This peat is pre-dominantly organic matter, with a small mineral component (<30%, and often only a few percent), and thus peat physical properties, e.g., pore size distribution, bulk density, thermal and hydraulic conductivities, differ significantly from those of mineral soils [e.g., Boelter, 1964, 1969; Walmsey, 1977; Hillel, 1980]. Peat ash-free bulk densities are typically 0.02 to 0.35 g cm\u20133 [e.g., Walmsey, 1977]; based on extensive sampling in western Canada [Zoltai et al., 2000], shrubby and treed fens generally have a median of bulk density of 0.1\u20130.15 g cm\u20133, while bogs and open fens have a median of bulk density of 0.06\u20130.1 g cm\u20133 [Zicheng Yu, personal communication]. Peat porosities are >0.8 cm3 cm\u20133 [Verry and Boelter, 1978]. Mineral soil bulk densities are typically 1.1\u20131.6 g cm\u20133, and porosities are typically 0.3\u20130.6 cm3 cm\u20133 [e.g., Hillel, 1980].The low bulk density and high porosity of peat give it significantly different thermal properties than mineral soils [Hillel, 1980], a factor that can be important in permafrost development and decay [Zoltai, 1993]. Peat heat capacity and thermal conductivity are highly dependent on moisture content [Farouki, 1981]. Kettridge and Baird [2007] devel-oped peat-specific predictive relationships of vertical varia-tions in heat capacity through the unsaturated zone of poorly 24 INCORPORATING NORTHERN PEATLANDS INTO GLOBAL CLIMATE MODELSdecomposed Sphagnum peat and between peat thermal con-ductivity and heat capacity.Most land surface models in GCMs use some variant of Richards\u2019 equation for modeling soil water dynamics [e.g., Cox et al., 1999], and the required hydraulic parameters (sat-urated hydraulic conductivity, porosity, specific yield) and functions relating soil water content to matric potential and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity come from parameteriza-tions developed as functions of soil texture [e.g., Clapp and Hornberger, 1978]. Peatland soils require new parameteri-zations, and some work has been done on this [e.g., Letts et al., 2000]. One particular challenge is that peats often have a very steep decline in hydraulic conductivity (often more than two orders of magnitude) in the top tens of centimeters of peat [e.g., Paavilainen and P\u00e4iv\u00e4nen, 1995]; this can pose numerical problems in solving Richard\u2019s equation for the relatively coarse vertical representation of soils common in GCMs. Pauwels and Wood [1999a, 1999b] incorporated a moss (organic) soil layer into a land-surface energy bal-ance model, the type of model that would be a land-surface modeling scheme in a GCM. The addition of a moss layer improved model simulations of soil temperature and mois-ture in boreal forest stands with thick organic horizons; the model was not tested against peatland data. Beringer et al. [2001] incorporated a moss and lichen layer into the soil rep-resentation of a GCM land surface model. This surface layer enhanced soil infiltration and insulated the soil, making it cooler in summer and warmer in winter. Moss and lichen metabolism and carbon cycling were not modeled. In their work on incorporating the thermal and hydrologic influences of organic soils into a global climate model, Lawrence and Slater [2008] used data on soil C content of the upper 1.5 m of soil from the Global Soil Data Task [2000], available at 1\u00b0 \u00b4 1\u00b0 resolution, to derive a gridded soil carbon data set. The soil C was distributed over seven soil layers represent-ing the top 1.38 m of the soil, with a prescribed soil carbon density profile. The original field data for this database come from ~21,000 soil profiles [Tempel et al., 1996], or about 1 profile per 6000 km2 of the earth\u2019s ice-free land surface. The approach of Lawrence et al. [2008] is acknowledged to be a first attempt at representing the physical influence of organic-rich soil (of which peatlands are a particular class) in the climate system. The coarse resolution of the source, and regridding of the data, meant that the organic matter was effectively spread over the grid cell and that the depth of the \u201cpeatlands,\u201d which typically would occupy only a fraction of a grid cell, was shallower than many observed peat pro-files. More importantly, this approach did not fully address peatland carbon cycling because bryophytes were not rep-resented (see section 4.3 below), and the soil carbon pools were fixed in time and space.GCMs that include ecosystems and a carbon cycle require initialization of the vegetation cover and vegetation and soil carbon stocks; this is typically done by \u201cspinning up\u201d the model, that is, by running the model with a fixed or regularly repeating climate pattern until the soil and vegetation carbon Table 1. Peatland Characteristics That Will Require Model Development for Inclusion in GCMsaPeatland Characteristic Modeling IssuesThick organic soils (section 4.1) Thermal and hydraulic properties differ from mineral soils, and can be more variable both vertically and horizontally, e.g., saturated hydraulic conductivity can vary by orders of magnitude in a single vertical peat profile.Appropriate soil depth and layering may differ from current formulations appropriate for mineral soils. Soil profile is inherently dynamic over moderate timescales (decades or longer), with-out disturbance or erosion, including changes in soil thickness and soil hydraulic properties as a function of net peat accumulation, changes in vegetation composi-tion, and peat decompositionPeat properties are partially determined by overlying vegetation, creating stronger link between vegetation and soils than is typical for GCMs.Fine-scale spatial heterogeneity (section 4.2) Northern peatlands have significant variability in microtopography, vegetation, and water table depth over scales of meters to kilometers.Abundant nonvascular plant cover (section 4.3) Nonvascular plants have different physiology and phenology than vascular plants currently modeled.Anaerobic biogeochemistry (section 4.4) Carbon and nitrogen cycle in ways and at rates not characteristic of drained mineral soils.Unique disturbance characteristics (section 4.5) Peatlands burn, but little is known about peatland recovery after fire.Thermokarst dynamics and erosion in permafrost/peat soils generates major changes in surface characteristics; this is not currently modeled in GCMs.aSee discussion in section 4.FROLkING ET AL. 25pools reach quasi-steady state [e.g., Thornton and Rosen-bloom, 2005]. This steady state is determined over the long-est time period of the initialization climate data, so seasonal and interannual variability might still occur with a 20-year climate file, but variability on time-scales longer than 20 years would be minimal [Thornton and Rosenbloom, 2005]. However, it seems that northern peatlands can be still ac-cumulating carbon as peat ~5000 to 10,000 years after initial formation [e.g., Roulet et al., 2007; Nilsson et al., 2008], and many may not have reached steady state. This ongoing ac-cumulation is slow, 0.03 kg C m\u20132 a\u20131 corresponds to 0.3 mm a\u20131 of peat with a bulk density of 100 kg m\u20133, assuming 0.5 kg C per kg peat. This timescale is longer, but not unreasonably longer, than the approximately 3000-year spin up timescale of the Biome-BGC carbon-nitrogen cycle model [Thornton and Rosenbloom, 2005]. Thornton and Rosenbloom [2005] show that the approximately 3000-year spin-up to equilib-rium can be reduced by up to 73% by implementing an accel-erated spin-up algorithm. If such an algorithm can be adapted so that it is applicable to peat accumulation, and also consid-ering the ongoing increases in computing capacity, the long peat accumulation timescale would no longer be so daunting.In the meantime, this slow approach to steady state may not compromise a GCM initialization algorithm. In a simple peat accumulation model, the surface or acrotelm peat (the top 0.3\u20130.5 m), which is the portion of the peat that has the most dynamic seasonal water and carbon cycling, reaches equilibrium much more rapidly, and the slow long-term ac-cumulation happens in the deeper, less dynamic anaerobic zone or catotelm [Clymo, 1984]. Belyea and Baird [2006] argue that peatlands are complex adaptive systems and that the acrotelm is probably never really in steady state; how-ever, from the practical point of view of initializing a peat-land for a GCM, it may approach steady state if forced for millennia by a steady climate. The catotelm has only mini-mal direct interaction with the atmosphere and short-term climate system. This would change only in the case of a major disturbance (e.g., fire, or anthropogenic activity like harvest or draining) that exposed the catotelm to the atmos-phere. Long-term peat accumulation will also be relevant in applications of EMICS to Holocene climate dynamics, but is not yet considered in those models [e.g., Brovkin et al., 2002, 2008; Wang et al., 2005].4.2. Hydrology and Landscape Spatial HeterogeneityAs with all other ecosystems, soil temperature and mois-ture play an important role in peatland C cycling. However, in peatlands, the role of water is a dominant one. The excess amount of water stored in peatlands controls the predomi-nantly anoxic conditions that reduce decomposition, so that net ecosystem production is persistently positive (i.e., a CO2 sink). Methane, an end-product of anoxic decomposition, is an important greenhouse gas. Hydrology plays a key role in the relative strength of peatlands as a CO2 sink and as a CH4 source and thus on peatland net climate impact. Hence, it is necessary to understand and simulate the hydrology of peatlands to be able to explain and simulate their carbon ex-changes.Peatlands are unique ecosystems in the degree to which they influence their own hydrology. Because the accumu-lation of meters of peat occurs over millennia, it becomes the substrate that controls the position of the water table and the moisture condition for plants. Due to the near-surface decomposition and collapse of the original plant material, a peat profile develops a stratification with less decomposed fi-bric peat, with large pores and low density, near the surface, and more decomposed, relatively high-density peat with finer pores deeper in the profile. This transition from less to more decomposed peat, with accompanying large changes in hydraulic properties, occurs over several tens of centim-eters around the long-term average water table position. This characteristic, along with the balance and source of inputs and outputs of water, ultimately control structure and func-tion of peatlands. The tight coupling of peat structure and function and peatland hydrology has led Belyea and Baird [2006] to suggest peatlands be considered complex adap-tive systems, with important internal dynamic feedbacks governing their development and behavior. The significance of the very steep changes in properties and the existence of a near surface, hydrologically \u201cactive\u201d layer, or acrotelm, and a deeper, hydrologically much less active layer, the ca-totelm [Ingram, 1978] has been recognized for a long time [Clymo, 1984; Charman, 2002; Rydin and Jeglum, 2006]. In ombrotrophic peatlands the peat surface accumulates to an elevation above the local topography, and the water supply is only by atmospheric inputs, while minerotrophic peatlands receive small to large quantities of water that has been in contact with the mineral sediments either beneath or adjacent to a peatland. Peatlands span a gradient along this water/nutrient supply axis [Vitt, 2006], but for the purposes of simulation, the functional structure of peatlands and the biogeochemistry of carbon cycling the division between the ombrotrophic \u201cbog\u201d-like systems and minerotrophic \u201cfen\u201d-like systems may be sufficient as a first approximation [e.g., Frolking et al., 2001].Simulating the hydrology of a peatland to determine the position of the water table and the distribution of moisture above the water table represents a challenge even in the case of individual peatlands. There have been models of peatland hydrology, but these have been primarily for estimating the discharge from peatlands and have been based on relatively 26 INCORPORATING NORTHERN PEATLANDS INTO GLOBAL CLIMATE MODELSsimple empirical functions [e.g., Guertin et al., 1987; Verry et al., 1988]. There has also been a very long tradition of modeling peatland drainage for forestry and agricultural practices [e.g., Konyha et al., 1988]. However, there have been few modeling attempts to simulate peatland hydrology that are appropriate for climate and carbon simulations. One example is the recent work of Borren and Bleuten [2006], who combined the MODFLOW groundwater model with a dynamic digital elevation model (driven by peat accumu-lation) and a paleoclimate time series to simulate the cou-pled carbon and water cycles through the Holocene of an 800-km2 peatland complex in the West Siberian Lowlands. Peat hydraulic properties were constant unless the simulated peatland switched from fen to bog, which depended on wa-ter fluxes and assumed nutrient availability, so the primary feedback between peatland development and hydraulic prop-erties was through the digital elevation model. They found that long-term peat accumulation and lateral expansion were limited by hydrology and that model sensitivity to hydro-logical parameters was high.Comer et al. [2000] and Letts et al. [2000] modified the Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS) for the inclusion of peat and the simulation of the position of the water table. The revised CLASS was quite successful at simulating the moisture dynamics in fens and was able to reproduce the evapotranspiration losses for fens and bogs reasonably well [Comer et al., 2000], but failed to reproduce the runoff from bogs. CLASS does not include subsurface lateral flow, and this is the most important runoff pathway in bogs [e.g., Verry et al., 1988; Evans et al., 1999]. Yurova et al. [2007] and Yurova and Lankreijera [2007] have combined a soil organic matter model (ROMUL) and a surface climate-ecosystem model (GUESS) to simulate the coupling of hydrology and carbon dynamics in a Swedish northern fen. Others have de-veloped one-dimensional surface hydrological models that would be suitable for climate simulations but few have been evaluated for multiple years [e.g., Weiss et al., 2006].However, the problem becomes significantly more diffi-cult when a peatland has either significant internal redistri-bution of water (i.e., spatial heterogeneity within a peatland) or when it receives a meaningful proportion of the water re-quired to maintain a high water table from beyond its bound-aries (e.g., groundwater inputs). Spatial heterogeneity within northern peatlands is extremely common [e.g., Couwenberg and Joosten, 2005] and may play an important role in the peatland water and carbon balance. Sonnentag et al. [2008] modified the Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator for peatland hydrology, and ran it in a version of the Terrain-Lab model to simulate the effect of the mesoscale spatial variability (on the order of 1 km) on the hydrology and net ecosystem productivity of a peatland. They found a strong correlation between the spatial variability of simulated eva-potranspiration (ET) and gross primary productivity (GPP), and that ignoring the effect of spatial variability systemati-cally underestimated ET and GPP by ~10%. If external wa-ter inputs to a peatland are significant, the peatland needs to be simulated in the context of its hydrological setting within the surrounding watershed. If the input of water from out-side the peatland is a function of the surface topography, then lateral inputs could potentially be simulated by some topography-based flow modeling [e.g., Gedney and Cox, 2003]. However, in many regions where annual potential evapotranspiration minus precipitation is very small or even negative, e.g., boreal western Canada, it has been shown that external inputs of water are essential for peatlands and that the external input is not related to surface topography but rather to the complex structure of the underlying geology and surface deposits [Devito et al., 2005]. This situation is going to present a serious challenge for climate simula-tions given the current hydrology in climate models and the state of global data sets of underlying geology and surface deposits. Baird et al. [this volume] present a detailed dis-cussion of spatial heterogeneity issues related to northern peatlands and outline a multiscale scheme for addressing them.At the global scale, there have been a number of attempts to estimate and map the distribution of peatlands and wet-lands [e.g., Matthews and Fung, 1987; Lehner and D\u00f6ll, 2004]. These distributions are based on a combination of large-scale topographic modeling and globally mapped surface characteristics such as indices of inundation, soil properties, and vegetation. There have been attempts to simulate the distribution of wetlands using topographic wet-ness indexes. Kirkby et al. [1995] mapped the distribution of northern European wetlands using the topographic wetness index first proposed by Beven and Kirkby [1979]. Recently, Gedney and Cox [2003] used the same topographic index to simulate grid-scale runoff in a GCM and found improved estimates of global runoff (bias reduction from 37 to 25%), improved estimates of precipitation (though not statistically significant improvements), and resulting patterns of saturated areas given by the topographic index (a new model result) that were consistent with major wetlands areas identified in the wetland distribution maps developed by Aselmann and Crutzen [1989]. Gedney and Cox [2003] concluded that any improvement in subgrid scale representation of soil moisture heterogeneity is an important step toward improving GCM projections of climate and hydrological changes.The final aspect of hydrology in peatlands necessary to simulating the carbon balance is the transport/export of DOC. Multiyear observations of carbon balances on several peatlands have shown that the export of DOC is between FROLkING ET AL. 2710 and 20 g C m\u20132 a\u20131, and this is the same order of magni-tude as the long-term accumulation of organic matter in the peatlands [Roulet et al., 2007; Nilsson et al., 2008]. The pro-duction of DOC is a function of decomposition, but only a small fraction of the DOC produced is exported; the controls on DOC export are both hydrological and biogeochemical [Kalbitz et al., 2000]. Simulation of DOC export in peat-land models has used a fixed DOC concentration and water export [Frolking et al., 2002], but this simply means DOC export tracks runoff, which is clearly not always the case [Fraser et al., 2001]. Yurova et al. [2007] developed a model based on convection and dispersion equations to simulate DOC concentration within a peatland and in peatland dis-charge. A simplified parameterization of export, based on this approach, might be found for coarse scale climate, car-bon simulations. Moore [this volume] reviews DOC export from northern peatlands.4.3. Nonvascular VegetationPlant functional types in peatlands are generally similar to those found in other terrestrial ecosystems, e.g., woody plants (deciduous and evergreen trees and shrubs), grami-noids (sedges, rushes, grasses), forbs (other herbaceous plants), and bryophytes (nonvascular plants such as mosses and lichens). The primary differences between peatland and nonpeatland systems are that in peatlands (1) in some cases, bryophytes can account for a majority of total vegeta-tion biomass and productivity [Moore et al., 2002], and (2) a fraction of the typical soil 0.5 m \u201croot zone\u201d [Jackson et al., 1996] is often saturated, so plant rooting strategies and vertical root distributions may be different. The physiology of nonvascular plants is typically not represented in global carbon-climate models.Bryophytes have no roots nor vascular system [Proctor, 2000], so land surface model developments related to soil moisture, root distributions, and leaf stomatal control on water and carbon exchanges [e.g., Sellers et al., 1997] are not directly relevant. Bryophyte metabolic rates are strongly related to their leaf water content [Proctor, 1982, 2000]; this presents a significant challenge to the vertical resolv-ing power of climate model soil hydrology because bryo-phyte metabolism is sensitive to the water content of only the top few centimeters of the soil (peat and moss), rather than a thicker root zone. Bryophytes are also able to respond very quickly to changing environmental conditions, e.g., the seasonal temperature cycle and the subseasonal wet-ting and drying associated with weather patterns [Proctor, 1982, 2000], requiring new functions or algorithms for veg-etation seasonal phenology. Bryophytes may be responsible for a significant fraction of the net ecosystem productivity in the \u201cshoulder seasons,\u201d in early spring before vascular plants have emerged from their winter dormancy [Moore et al., 2006] and perhaps also in the autumn when vascular plants, particularly deciduous plants, have senesced. Lack-ing roots, algorithms for carbon allocation in bryophytes can be simpler than for vascular plants [e.g., Frolking et al., 2002].Many peatlands are ombrotrophic, receiving the bulk of their nutrient inputs from wet and dry deposition. Mosses, which often develop a fairly complete ground cover under any emergent vascular vegetation, intercept and efficiently absorb much of wet nutrient deposition before it can per-colate to the vascular root zone [e.g., Aerts et al., 1992; Malmer et al., 1994; Nordbakken et al., 2003]. Thus, the nutrients only become available to the vascular plants after they have cycled through the mosses and are re-mineralized during decomposition of moss litter. Limpens et al. [2003] found that nitrogen additions favored vascular plants and suppressed Sphagnum growth in greenhouse mesocosm studies. In the competition for light, vascular plants have the advantage because they can grow above the moss layer, al-though rapidly growing moss can engulf vascular seedlings [Limpens et al., 2003]. In a nutrient addition manipulation study on an ombrotrophic bog, Bubier et al. [2007] found that enhanced shrub growth shaded the underlying Sphag-num through increased leaf area and increased leaf litter fall; Sphagnum cover diminished substantially, but Polytrichum cover increased, and overall moss biomass diminished by about 50% over a 5-year treatment period. They could not determine whether Polytrichum growth was due to nutri-ent enrichment or diminished competition from declining Sphagnum species. Shading and cooler moss temperature may also have had an impact [Bubier et al., 2007]. Pastor et al. [2002] presented a simple model of vegetation dynam-ics, simulating competition between a single vascular plant type and a single moss type. The model centers around ac-cess to different nutrient sources, wet deposition for mosses and mineralized nutrients for vascular plants. Moss and vas-cular plants also compete for other resources (e.g., light), simulated as a reduction in growth rate proportional to the biomass of the other plant type. This simple model gener-ated nonlinear, dynamic behavior, and several different stable states can emerge that influence the capacity of the system to store and release carbon and nutrients. Frolking et al. [2001] used a simple model of peat accumulation to show that accumulation rates were sensitive to the fraction of total productivity generated by mosses and by vascular plants. Finally, bryophytes, and particularly Sphagnum spe-cies, play an important role in peat accumulation and peat-land development, through their effects on the chemistry of peatland waters, their interactions with vascular plants, 28 INCORPORATING NORTHERN PEATLANDS INTO GLOBAL CLIMATE MODELSand their production of decay-resistant litter [Rydin et al., 2006].Published data on above- and belowground vascular plant biomass and productivity for wetlands (peatlands, wet tun-dra, freshwater marsh, and salt marsh) show that wetlands, overall, have root biomass values and above- to belowground biomass ratios similar to those of nonforested systems (e.g., grasslands) [Jackson et al., 1996; Mokany et al., 2006; T. R. Moore, personal communication, 2008]. Wetlands generally have shallower root distributions than other terrestrial sys-tems, and the below- to aboveground vascular plant biomass ratio for peatlands of ~0.8 (T. R. Moore, personal commu-nication, 2008) is substantially higher than the root:shoot biomass ratios reported in Mokany et al. [2006] for boreal forests, i.e., ~0.4 for shoot biomass >75 Mg ha\u20131 and ~0.25 for shoot biomass <75 Mg ha\u20131). There is no indication whether or not the boreal forest data summarized in Mokany et al. [2006] included nonvascular biomass.4.4. BiogeochemistryComplete modeling of the peatland carbon cycle, and its impact on the global atmospheric burdens of CO2 and CH4, cannot be done without explicit or implicit representation of anaerobic decomposition of organic matter, and its impact on organic carbon accumulation rates, nutrient mineraliza-tion rates, nutrient availability, and methane emissions. A key challenge is to develop a comprehensive representation of the impacts of anaerobic conditions in the soil on all of these processes, along with a robust algorithm for the soil physics and hydrology that reliably simulates both the posi-tion of the water table, the peat water content above the wa-ter table, and the moss water content. This is not done at this time in any global coupled carbon-climate model.Peatland methane emissions are the net of methane pro-duction and oxidation, and are influenced by transport mechanisms from peat to the atmosphere (diffusion, bub-bling, plant-mediated transport). Peatland methane emis-sions have been modeled for the past decade or two, and insights from this work should be useful as climate mod-els address these biogeochemical issues. Frolking and Crill [1994] modeled peat temperature and moisture profiles and correlated this to net methane flux. Granberg et al. [2001] and Kettunen [2003] extended this to modeling of plant pro-ductivity, methane production, oxidation, transport, and net flux. There are similarly constructed global-scale models of methane emissions from wetlands [e.g., Walter et al., 2001; Cao et al., 1996]. There have been studies with GCMS of climate change impacts on wetland methane emissions [e.g., Gedney and Cox, 2003; Shindell et al., 2004]; however, these studies have not directly incorporated the wetlands into the climate model, but have instead used GCM climate change projections to drive a model of wetland extent and meth-ane emissions, again without a full simulation of the carbon cycle. There are peatland carbon cycle models that include anaerobic suppression of decomposition and vegetation pro-ductivity, but do not simulate methane production, oxida-tion, and transport [e.g., Frolking et al., 2002; Yurova et al., 2007; St-Hilaire et al., 2009]. There are several terrestrial biogeochemical models that simulate wetland biogeochem-istry, including explicit or implicit representation of aerobic and anaerobic processes in the soil at varying levels of de-tail [e.g., DNDC, Zhang et al., 2002; Li et al., 2004; ecosys, Grant and Roulet, 2002; Biome-BGC, Bond-Lamberty et al., 2007; NASA-CASA, Potter et al., 2001; TEM, Zhuang et al., 2004]. These models can also simulate upland systems, but to date, they have not been applied to wetlands/peatlands at global scales, and only the TEM model has been applied at regional scales for a landscape mosaic of peatlands and uplands [Zhuang et al., 2004].Gedney et al. [2004] used a GCM-driven topographic index estimation of saturated area (discussed in section 4.2 above) to simulate climate change impacts on CH4 emis-sions from wetlands. In this exercise, they calibrated the CH4 production rate and temperature sensitivity to match current global methane emissions and then estimated changes in wet-land area and CH4 emissions over the period up to 2100. A limitation to this approach is that it is essentially an estimate of inundated area, while many wetlands have water tables slightly below the surface, and the slight variations in the location of this water table has a significant impact on meth-ane fluxes. Bubier et al. [2005] estimated a 60% increase in methane flux at the landscape scale due to small changes in water table depth (2\u20135 cm) and slight warming (0.5\u00b0) of small wetlands in a wet and a dry year. This variability, at large scales, has been suggested as a cause for observed interannual variability in the atmospheric methane burden over the past decade or two [Dlugokencky et al., 2001; Bous-quet et al., 2006]. A difference of water table elevation from the surface to only 0.3 m depth is the difference between a peatland emitting a large amount of CH4 and very little or none (i.e., all the CH4 the peatland produces being oxidized) [Granberg et al., 1997]. Topographic index hydrological modeling [e.g., Beven and Kirkby, 1978] may not be suffi-cient to the task of simulating the subtle differences in water table depth in the relatively flat landscapes that are common in much of the domain of northern peatlands. However, the shallow groundwater modeling of Borren and Bleuten [2006] did simulate water table depth variability at relevant verti-cal resolution over a large peatland complex. This will be further complicated by the effect of melting permafrost and the subsequent changes in landscape topography, peatland FROLkING ET AL. 29hydrology, and ecosystem structure and function. At a site in northern Sweden, the melting of the permafrost has led to a several order of magnitude increase in CH4 emissions and significant changes in CO2 exchange and DOC export [Christensen et al., 2004; Malmer et al., 2005; Johansson et al., 2006], though the latter change was not as clear as that of CH4. How long this impact on carbon fluxes will persist is not known.Another challenge for modeling peatlands is the range of soil pH that occurs across peatland types; peatland pH in-teracts with vegetation species composition, nutrient avail-ability, and productivity [e.g., Bubier, 1995]. Perhaps the first order effects can be captured in a simple peatland clas-sification (e.g., bog and fen) with model parameterizations specific to the vegetation types that dominate these broad classes, in a similar way to how GCMs would disaggregate forests into a few classes (evergreen or deciduous, needle-leaved, or broad-leaved).4.5. DisturbanceFor many natural landscapes, disturbance by wind or fire plays an important role in determining landscape character-istics that are of central importance to the coupled climate-carbon system [e.g., Foster et al., 1998]. Northern peatland disturbances include fire (both natural and human-caused); flooding/inundation due to beaver activity, reservoir con-struction, or thermokarst activity associated with permafrost degradation; water table drawdown as peatlands are drained for forestry, agriculture, or peat extraction; pollution/nutrient deposition (e.g., nitrogen and sulfur deposition); and linear disturbances such as roads and seismic lines that can frag-ment peatlands and alter their hydrology [Turetsky and St. Louis, 2006]. Only a few of these disturbances are unique to peatlands. Many that are common to all ecosystems (fire, for-estry and agriculture, atmospheric deposition) are beginning to be incorporated into global climate models. For example, GCM simulations planned for the fifth IPCC Assessment will include, to a degree that will vary from model to model, the dominant human land use activities of agriculture and forestry [e.g., Washington et al., 2008], along with radiative forcing from anthropogenic greenhouse gases. Simulation of their impacts on peatlands may follow after inclusion of peatlands in the models. Linear disturbances, beaver activ-ity, peatland draining, and peat extraction are not likely to be included in climate models in the near future.Fire is a dominant form of disturbance in boreal forest ecosystems [e.g., Stocks et al., 2002], and boreal fire recur-rence intervals range from <100 to ~1000 years [Balshi et al., 2007]. In forests, severe fires have a significant impact on forest structure and age distribution [e.g., Oliver and Larson, 1996] and thus on the forest\u2019s direct interactions with the climate system through surface albedo and rough-ness. Peatlands also can burn, and their fire regimes may be similar to upland boreal forests, at least in Central Canada [Turetsky et al., 2004]. This has not been well documented across the pan-boreal domain of northern peatlands, how-ever, and little is known about the statistics of peatland burn severity [Turetsky et al., 2004]. Fire algorithms are depend-ent on fuel availability and near-surface soil moisture with different combustion efficiencies assumed for vegetation, litter, and root biomass [Thonicke et al., 2001; Thornton et al., 2007]. Parameterizations will need to be developed for peatland fires.Thermokarst landscapes arise in regions where melting permafrost and draining water cause the ground to settle un-evenly. There is evidence that the surface water conditions can change quickly as permafrost thaws and hydrological flow paths are modified [e.g., Jorgenson et al., 2006]. There is more evidence of thermokarst impacts on lakes because they are more easily detected in spaceborne remote sens-ing than peatlands, but the hydrological impacts on lakes will also apply to wetlands. Thermokarst (or thaw) lakes can form in permafrost regions when massive ground-ice wedges melt, causing the ground surface to subside and lakes to form. Further ground melting can eventually lead to drain-age and disappearance of thermokarst lakes [Smith et al., 2005]. Riordan et al. [2006] found that the area and number of small water bodies in non-arctic Alaska decreased from 1950 to 2002, and attributed this change to increased drain-age and or an increase in evapotranspiration. Soil thermal regimes and ground thaw are very dependent on soil ther-mal properties and water content, so a net drying (or wet-ting) of soils, particularly organic soils [e.g., Lawrence et al., 2008] will have an impact on permafrost formation and degradation rates. Modeling this dynamic nature of the land surface [e.g., West and Plug, 2008; Plug and West, 2009] may prove to be difficult in a GCM. In principal, a model could be structured to permit the fractional area of wetland and upland zones to evolve over time, although in practice, this may be technically challenging when it comes to main-taining water, energy, and carbon conservation as soil char-acteristics evolve.5. CONCLUDING COMMENTSPeatland carbon cycling is affected by weather and cli-mate, and the Earth\u2019s climate system is affected by peatland carbon cycling. This inherent feedback suggests that peat-lands should be incorporated into global climate models. However, northern peatlands have several unique character-istics that will make it difficult to represent their behavior 30 INCORPORATING NORTHERN PEATLANDS INTO GLOBAL CLIMATE MODELSin the Earth system within the vegetation classes of current global climate model land surface schemes. These charac-teristics include deep organic soils [a topic being addressed in current GCM model development; Lawrence and Slater, 2008], bryophyte vegetation, shallow water tables, and an-oxic soil profiles, a high degree of spatial heterogeneity in vegetation and hydrology, and some unique disturbance/re-covery characteristics. A primary requirement for a success-ful representation is for peatland distribution to correspond to wetland distribution, i.e., the peatlands form and persist where the land is wet. GCMs will need to be able to inter-relate soil moisture heterogeneity with soil carbon hetero-geneity. One potential solution is to split each grid cell into static wetland (peatland) and upland zones as is done in the TEM model [Zhuang et al., 2004]. Under this configuration, in wetland zones, carbon will accumulate, and peatlands can accumulate due to anoxic conditions that limit decomposi-tion. A limitation to this approach is the inherent assumption of stationarity, e.g., that wetland distribution is fixed in time and does not respond to changes in the surface water balance (though changes in the surface water balance would alter water table depth within wetland zones). A more dynamic representation of peatlands would include peatland initiation (probably as paludification) and growth and development, where hydrology and peatland vegetation would interact, rather than being prescribed as coincident.Global climate models have a global domain, and peat-lands do not only occur in the north, though a large major-ity of peatland research to date has been in the boreal and temperate zones. Incorporating peatlands into global cli-mate models will need to account for all peatlands, not just northern peatlands. Tropical peatlands occupy ~0.3\u20130.6 million km2, about 10% of the total global peatland area, and may contain ~20% of global peat carbon [Charman, 2002; Page et al., 2002, 2004]. These tropical peatlands also have accumulated peat over millennia, often to depths ~10 m [Page et al., 2004]. Many of the same issues will arise in representing tropical peatlands in global climate models (deep organic soils, shallow water tables and an-oxia, potentially unique disturbance regimes, spatial het-erogeneity); bryophytes probably play a less important role in most tropical peatlands than they do in northern peat-lands [Page et al., 2006]. Before we can know how well a peatland land surface scheme successfully developed for northern peatlands will work for tropical peatlands, there is a need for more basic observational data from tropical peatlands, vegetation ecology, hydrology, biogeochemical cycling, and palynology.Acknowledgments.

Principal models are a one-dlmenslonal radlative-convective model,\na three-dimensional global climate model, and an upper ocean model.\nPrincipal applications have been the study of the impact of C02, aerosols\nand the solar 'constant' on climate.\nProgress has been made in the 3-D model development towards physically\nrealistic treatment of these processes. In particular, a map of soil\nclassifications on i \u00b0 x I \u00b0 resolution has now been digitized, and soil\nproperties have been assigned to each soil type. Using this information\nabout soil properties, a method has been developed to simulate the hydraulic\nbehavior of soils of the world. This improved treatment of soil hydrology,\ntogether with the seasonally varying vegetation cover, will provide a more\nrealistic study of the role of the terrestrial biota in climate change.\nA new version of the climate model has been created which follows the\nisotopes of water and sources of water (or colored water) throughout the\nplanet. Each isotope or colored water source is a fraction of the climate\nmodel's water. It participates in condensation and surface evaporation at\ndifferent fractionation rates and is transported by the dynamics. A major\nbenefit of this project has been to improve the programming techniques and\nA-I\nphysical simulation of the water vapor budget of the climate model.\nApplications include simulations of deuterium and oxygen-18 for both current\nclimate and 18,000 years ago, the source of precipitation in each grid box\nin the North Hemisphere, and a stratospheric tritium experiment to simulate\nthe atomic testing of the 1950s and 60s (Koster et al., 1990).\nDuring the past year, papers have been published, which investigate\nthe impact of altered ocean heat transport on climate (Rind and Chandler,\n1991), and the likelihood of future drought caused by the projected increase\nin temperatures (Rind et al., 1990).\nModeling of the climate and vegetation change of the last 30,000\nyears, and of the Little Ice Age, has begun with the assistance of Rick\nHealy and initial attempts to compile appropriate boundary conditions for\nGCM runs.\nPaleoclimatic work in progress centers on both the Atlantic and\nPacific coasts. The North Atlantic research continues on the record of\nvegetation and climatic change from 18,000 years ago to the present. Pollen\nanalysis from Allamuchy Pond, western New Jersey, and Linsley Pond,\nConnecticut cores, as well as macrofossil identifications from both sites\nhave been completed. Accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) dating on\nmacrofossils from both cores indicates the presence of the Younger Dryas\nreversal, from 11,000-10,000 yr BP. These results are being summarized for\npublication in Quaternary Research. The southeastern U.S. paleoclimate\nresearch has continued, and M. Kneller (Graduate Research Associate,\nColumbia University) ahs completed the pollen, macrofossil, and loss-on-\nignition record for one site, Brown Pond, Virginia, which extends to 18,000\nyrs BP. She has re-cored the site several times, and is working on the\nA-2\ncorrelation of the stratigraphy from one core to another. AMS dating of the\ncore will provide a high-resolution chronology. The data will be presented\nfor her orals.\nResults from the North Pacific initiative on tephra deposits in\nsoutheastern Alaska will be published shortly (Rheile et al., 1991). A\nrecord of climatic and vegetation migration history in southeastern Alaska\nhas also been published recently (Peteet, 1991).\nNorth Pacific field work last summer resulted in the acquisition of\nbasal peat from about 40 peat cores in Alaska. The sites range from the\nKenai Peninsula northwestward in permafrostareas to the Yukon-Kuskokwim\nDelta. The frozen peat reaches at least 6 meters depth in some regions.\nThis material will be analyzed in the coming year.\nThe computer code of the ocean general circulation model has been\nstreamlined so that different numerical treatments can be implemented and\ntested. The streamlined code has been verified against the simulations of\nCox (1984). Progress has been made in implementing several vertical\ndifferencing schemes in the model, which include second and fourth order\nschemes. Sensitivity experiments are ongoing to test the effects of these\nschemes. A paper on computational diffusivity in the ocean model has been\npublished in J. Geophys. Res. (Yin and Fung, 1991).\nA necessary step in using ocean color data to understand the ocean's\nrole in the global carbon cycle is the derivation of incident solar\nradiation at the surface, as a forcing term for marine productivity. A\ncomputationally-efficient scheme for deriving surface solar radiation has\nbeen developed. The scheme incorporates 3-hourly data on cloud properties\nderived from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project.\nA-3\nComparisonwith ground truth shows that the schemeis accurate to \u00b1 7 w/m2.\nThe paper documenting the algorithm and results will appear in the Journal\nof Geophysical Research (Bishop and Rossow, 1991).\nResearch has been initiated to study the natural ocean variability on\na thousand year tlme-scale. This research project utilizes the NASA-GISS\nversion of Cox's oceanic general circulation model to perform a hierarchy of\nnumerical experiments. A first set of experiments was initiated for an\nidealized sector model describing one third of the world ocean, and one\nthird of the world land masses, but with a geometry similar to the Atlantic\nocean, which describes a dynamically important part of the world ocean.\nThis idealized model is designed to have somerealistic characteristics,\nsuch as the transport of the circumpolar current.\nThe ocean model has coarse resolution, with a horizontal grid spacing\nof 5 degrees longitude by 3.91 degrees latitude, and 15 vertical levels.\nThe model has been run for the barotropic case; a baroclinic run\ninitialized from zonally averaged climatological data is being performed,\naimed at describing the equilibrium of the ocean in time scales of decades.\nA second experiment is being run initialized from rest, that will describe\nthe ocean response to climate forcing at longer time scales.\nThe model physics was modified to include Philander and Pacanowski's\nparameterization of viscosity and diffuslvlty, to better describe the main\nthermocline. Complete mixing of gravitationally unstable parts of water\ncolumns is being introduced, for a better description of deep convection.\nUpdated equations of state are used, fitted to give in situ density as a\nfunction of potential temperature.\nA-4\nSensitivity studies were applied to the diffusion parameters, choosing\n8 x i0 s cm2/sec and 1.6 x 108 cm2/sec for horizontal viscosity and\ndiffusivity respectively. The time steps are i day for thermodynamic\nvariables and I hour for dynamic variables. Experiments for climate\nvariability will be performed with this model.\nA coastal hazards data base is being compiled to identify shorelines\nat high risk to future sea level rise, attributed to climate warming. Data\ncompilation has been completed for geological variables, for the U.S., and\nthe data base is currently being extended into Canada and Mexico (Gornitz,\n1990, 1991). Six additional climatological variables, relating to storm\nfrequency and intensity, are being added to the data base. An overall\ncoastal vulnerability index, CVl, combines the relative risk factors of each\nof the variables, relating to inundation and erosion hazards.\nExperimentation with various forms of CVl and weighting factors is in\nprogress.\nThe CVI has been used to identify high risk areas along sections of\nthe East Coast, including parts of Cape Cod, Long Island and the New Jersey\nbarrier beaches, the North Carolina Outer Banks, the southern Delmarva\nPeninsula, and the Georgia-South Carolina. Other high risk regions include\nthe Louisiana-Texas coast and the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, California.\nResults to date were presented at the recently concluded Coastal Zone 91\nConference, in Long Beach, CA (Gornitz et al., 1991).\nSAGE II\nIn accordance with the task to carry out modeling and interpretation\nof SAGE II data, a 23-1evel version of the 3-D GCM to be used has been\ndeveloped. This model extends from the surface up to 0.01 mb (=85 km).\nA-5\nModel improvementsduring the past year include the incorporation of gravity\nwave-induced stratospheric drag. With the incorporation of parameterization\nfor model generated gravity waves from the sources of topography, wind shear\nand convection, realistic simulations of the middle atmospheric climatology\nhave been made. An analysis of the SAGEretrieval of water vapor in the\ntropical lower stratosphere has been investigated.\nA paper has been recently published, which investigates the impact of\ndoubled CO2 on the climate of the stratosphere (Rind et al., 1990).\nTASKB: CLIMATEAPPLICATIONSOFEARTHANDPLANETARYOBSERVATIONS\nCloud Climatology\nDuring the past year, further refinements were made to the analyses of\ncloud detection over polar regions and winter land areas. For the polar\nregions, the use of the 3.7 km wavelength channel on AVHRR helps to detect\noptically thin, low-level clouds missed by the regular cloud detection\nmethod. This raises the ISCCP annual mean cloud amount in the Arctic to\nabout 60%, which is in better agreement with the estimates based on surface\nobservations. The variations of land surface temperature cause some false\ncloud-detection; however, the estimated error in the satellite-based surface\ntemperature is about 3-4K, which is smaller than the 6K assumed in the cloud\ndetection algorithm. If the infrared threshold is lowered from 6K to 4K,\nthe average cloud amount over higher latitude land areas is increased by\nabout 3-5%, producing very good agreement with surface observations.\nDescriptions of both of these results are being prepared for publication.\nThe initial study of tropical convection using ISCCP data showed that\nthe occurrence of deep convection is not simply related to sea surface\nA-6\ntemperature (SST). There are both locations with high SSTthat do not have\nconvection and locations with low SSTthat do (Rossowand Schiffer, 1991).\nFurther analysis of observations to determine the reasons for these\nvariations of tropical convection, which do not simply follow warmer SSTs,\nas commonlysupposed, has shownthat the moisture budget of the marine\nboundary layer plays a key role in inhibiting convection over somewarm\nwater areas; convection is also stimulated over colder water by dynamical\nde-stabilization of both the boundary layer and the lower troposphere. A\npreliminary examination of changes in convection during E1 Nino events also\nshows that the nature of the shift in convective properties associated with\nthis slow change is not the sameas the rapid variations that occur on daily\nto monthly time scales. These results, presented by R. Fu at the\ninternational Tropical OceanGlobal AtmosphereConference, formed part of\nFurs Ph.D. thesis, that was successfully completed and defended this year.\nThe extensive analysis of the variations of the optical thickness of\nlow level clouds, at low and middle latitudes, for one whole year, has been\npresented at the American Meteorological Society Conference on Atmospheric\nRadiation, and submitted for publication. The analysis is continuing by\ninvestigating the role played by other factors that can influence the cloud\noptical thickness, primarily cloud vertical extent. This study, combining\nsatellite and surface weather observations, can also look at the large scale\nsynoptic relationships that control the properties of low-level cloudiness.\nThe significance of these optical thickness variations with temperature is\nbeing tested in a diagnostic model, that evaluates the implied radiative\nfeedback. This work forms the thesis research of one GRA.\nA-7\nThe new cloud parameterizatlon for the GISS climate GCM continues to\nbe tested by comparisons against the ISCCP data and by performing climate\nsensitivity studies with the climate model.\nTesting of the cloud particle size retrieval scheme also continues. A\npreliminary survey of cloud particles sizes, over one month of global data,\nshows excellent agreement with available information. In particular, the\nsystematically larger sizes in marine clouds, as compared to land clouds, is\nreadily apparent. This study already shows that the relationship among\ncloud particle size, optical thickness and water content is more variable\nthan commonly assumed in most climate models. This work constitutes the\nthesis research of another GRA.\nComparisons of ISCCP cloud properties, microwave-based and surface-\nobserved estimates of preciptitation show that cloud type is strongly\ncorrelated to precipitation amounts only in the tropics. No clear relation\nseems to hold at higher latitudes. Thus, the research effort has shifted to\na comparison of ISCCP and microwave values of cloud water content. If good\nagreement can be obtained for liquid water clouds, then the difference for\nmixed-phase clouds at higher latitudes can be used to estimate cloud ice\ncontents for the first time. Moreover, if these estimates of cloud water\ncontent can be made accurately enough, it may be possible to estimate\nprecipitation from a microphysical model. This work represents the thesis\nresearch of a third GRA.\nThe analysis of infrared spectra of Jupiter's atmosphere collected by\nVoyager has been concluded, resulting in four papers so far (Carlson et al.,\n1991a-d). The first paper is a re-analysis of the determination of the\nabundance of water on Jupiter that shows that earlier analyses, which\nA-8\nneglected or mis-represented cloud spectral effects, were incorrect in\nclaiming that the water to hydrogen ratio is sub-solar. Our analysis places\na lower limit on this ratio of 1.5 times the solar value. The second paper\nrefines the earlier analysis of the vertical and horizontal variations of\nthe two species of hydrogen to show that their abundance ratios are\ninfluenced by equilibration on ammonia cloud particle surfaces and are\nsignificant indicators of atmospheric motions. The third paper completes a\ndetailed analysis of the North Equatorial Belt, retrieving the properties of\nthree cloud layers, the temperature profile, and the abundances of seven gas\nspecies. The fourth paper extends this analysis to the other low latitude\nregions and shows that the correlated variations of gas abundances,\ntemperature and cloud structure all provide consistent indicators of\natmospheric motions.\nGlobal, total solar and thermal infrared fluxes at the top of the\natmosphere and at the surface have been calculated for six months using\ncloud, surface and atmospheric datasets from ISCCP. Validation studies and\nsensitivity tests are continuing. Initial results were presented at the\nAmerican Meteorlogical Society Conference on Atmospheric Radiation. Routine\ncalculations will begin to produce such datasets covering several years,\nincluding an E1 Nino event. These results will be used to study cloud\nradiative feedbacks on synoptic, seasonal and longer-term variations.\nThe simpler method for calculated surface solar irradiance has been\ncompleted and tested. The method is described, along with the early\nanalysis results, in a paper submitted to the Journal of Geophysical\nResearch.\nA-9\nISCCPdeep convective cloud indices have been combined with Climate\nAnalysis Center sea surface temperatures (SST), Florida State University\nsurface wind data, as well as radiosonde temperature and humidity profiles,\nin order to explain the large-scale distribution of deep convection over the\ntropical Pacific Ocean. Deep convection and convergence lead the seasonal\nmigration of SST by several months. Convection can be suppressed over warm\nocean waters because of either a stable layer capping the Pacific Bottom\nLayer (PBL) or low PBL humidity. The sense of cloud feedback in the\ntropical Pacific on interannual time scales can be either negative or\npositive depending on the spatial scale over which the data are averaged\n(Rong Fu, Ph.D dissertation, 1991; Fu et al., 1990).\nplanetary Studies\nTracking techniques for deducing winds above the visible cloud level\non Venus have been refined and applied to additional image pairs.

The fresh water balance of the major ocean basins\nA-13\ninfluences the density stratification and therefore the stability of the\nwater column. Atmospheric import or export of fresh water into regions of\ndeep water formation (Antarctic and North Atlantic Oceans) might influence\nthese processes significantly.\nDuring the last year, the Atlantic fresh water balance using the GISS\n4 \u00b0 x 5 \u00b0 grid model was examined under three climate scenarios: current\nclimate (control run), double CO2 and the last glacial maximum (18000 BP).\nFurthermore, the same calculations were done with a data set of observations\nof wind and humidity compiled by Oort (1983).\nResults are summarized below (see also Zaucker and Broecker, 1991,\nAppendix I):\nThe Atlantic drainage basin looses about twice as much fresh water in\nthe double-CO 2 scenario than in the control run (0.30 Sv versus 0.13\nSv). The estimate for the fresh water balance of the Atlantic Ocean\nbased on Oort's data set (0.32 Sv) is significantly larger than the\nresult from the control run [Zaucker and Broecker, 1991; Table i].\nThe transport patterns ([Zaucker and Broecker, 1991; Figures i and 2])\nin the model runs and Oort's data set show large differences\nespecially near mountain ranges. This is probably caused by an\ninadequate representation of high orography in the model (averaging\nover a grid box).\nUsing the same drainage divides as in the control and double-CO 2 run,\na freshwater loss by the Atlantic of 0.24 Sv occurred in the glacial\nA-14\nclimate scenario. This preliminary result should not be taken too\nseriously, however. The large ice shields over North America and\nEurope must probably be taken into account when defining the drainage\ndivides. Especially during the growing period of the ice shields not\nmuch water raining onto them will run off into the rivers and oceans.\nWork on this subject is currently in progress.\nFigures 3 and 4 show some results of the 222Rn runs with the GISS 8 \u00b0 x\nI0 \u00b0 grid model. The differences of the uniform (I atom/cm2/sec) and the\nsource function defined by Dorr [1991] can clearly be seen in regions with\nstronglyvarying soil grain sizes. This variable source function is\ncertainly a first order approximation. Some regions, especially wetlands\nand tropical rain forests must be studied in much more detail (dependency of\nsource strength on soil moisture, etc.).\nIn addition to the work on water vapor and radon, three student\nprojects have been funded from this Cooperative Agreement during the last\nyear. A brief summary of their research activities follows.\nI) Rachel Oxburgh: The role of the oceanic CaCO 3 cycle in glacial to\ninterglacial atmospheric CO 2 change:\nEvidence has been recently uncovered that the glacial to interglacial\nchange in CO 3\" ion concentration in the deep sea is underestimated because\nthe true change has been masked in the sedimentary record by chemical\nerosion. Intense CaCO 3 dissolution during times of peak interglaciation\nexhumes CaCO 3 rich sediments of glacial age. 14C and ISO measurements on\nforaminifera from thse sediments will be made in an attempt to reconstruct\nthe true CO 3\" change. The cause of this change and its impact on the CO 2\nA-15\ncontent of the atmosphere will also be investigated. While these results\nare aimed at understanding the natural CO 2 changes associated with glacial\ncycles, they also have applicability to what will occur as fossil fuel CO2\nbuilds up in the deep sea.\n2) Jordan Clark: Noble gas temperatures for glacial age aquifer water:\nAn enigma exists with regard to the temperature distribution on our\nplanet during glacial time. The position of the snowlines on tropical\nmountains suggest that a 5\u00b0C cooling occured several kilometers above sea\nlevel. By contrast, planktonic forminifera from deep sea sediments, both\nthrough their relative abundances, and through their oxygen isotope ratios,\nindicate that the tropical sea surface temperature was only I \u00b1 I\u00b0C colder\nduring glacial time. As means of attacking this problem, the Lamont-Doherty\ngroup headed by Peter Schlosser has been studying water from deep aquifers,\nwhich through water isotope ratios and radiocarbon to carbon ratios, can be\nshown to have left the surface during glacial time. The objective is to use\nthe noble gas concentrations in this water to obtain soil temperatures for\nglacial time. So far, research of this type has shown that in Europe, North\nAmerica and South Africa, temperatures were about 5\u00b0C colder during glacial\ntime. Jordan Clark is working closely with this group and checking some the\nassumptions associated with this method. For example, is the chemical\ncomposition of the salt in this water consistent with a simple piston-like\nflow? What factors other than radioactive decay influence the 14C/C ratio?\n3) Jo Lin: Comparison of uranium series and radiocarbon ages on tufas from\nthe shorelines of Lake Lahontan.\nClosed-basin lakes of desert regions are the best recorders of\nprecipitation rate changes associated with glacial cycles. The water\nA-16\nreaching these lakes from their mountain-fed rivers can only leave by\nevaporation. Hence the size of the lake (and also the elevation of the lake\nsurface) changes with changing precipitation. In the Great Basin of the\nUnited States, these lakes were larger during glacial time than they are\ntoday. Of particular interest are the highest levels which were achieved\naround 13,500 years ago, which is when deglaciation began on a global scale.\nThis period of very high precipitation falls between two major steps in the\nwarming of northern Europe. The first is the deglaciation of the major\nAlpine valleys, which occurred between 14,800 and 14,200 radiocarbon years\nago. The second is the sudden appearanceof trees 12,800 radiocarbon years\nago, in the Alpine Valleys, and the associated 3_ shift in the 180/ISOratio\nof CaCO3 deposited in Swiss Lakes. What was global climate like during the\ninterval between these events? Could the high precipitation rates in the\nGreat Basin be related to a larger scale climatic pattern? The first step\nin this study is to document the reliability of the age of the high\nshorelines. Jo Lin is doing both radiocarbon and 23\u00b0Th - 234U dating of\ntufas from this shoreline. As the tufas contain 232Th, a number of samples\nmust be measured to construct an isochron. A first attempt yielded a Z3\u00b0Th\nage of 16,000 years for tufas previously dated at 13,500 radiocarbon years.\nThe 2500 year difference between these ages agrees with Bard et al.\u00b0s\nfinding for Barbados corals of this age. Hence it appears that the timing\nof this event does lie between that of the Alpine deglaciation event and the\nAlpine reforestation event.\nA-17\nPUBLICATIONS\n(1990-1991 and in press)\n!ask C\nBirchfield, G.E. and W.S.

Droogers, M. Akbari, M. Torabi, E. Pazira. \n \n \nAbstract \nOne-third of the irrigated land in the major irrigation countries is affected by salinity or \nis expected to become so in the near future. A rapid assessment to evaluate the effect of \nchanges in irrigation water quality and quantity is applied for the Rudasht irrigation \nproject in Iran. This was performed by using a physically based, well-tested simulation \nmodel for crop growth, water and salt transport at field scale. Results indicate that the \ncurrent practice of 900 mm annual irrigation application rates for cotton, given the \ncurrent salinity level of 4 dS m\n-1, is close to the optimal one. Graphs are presented to \nevaluate the effect of different combinations of application rates and salinity levels on \nyields, and the water and salt balance. It was concluded that the methodology presented \nhere is versatile, rapid, and transferable to other conditions. Moreover, the method \nproduces output at a high spatial and temporal resolution over a long time frame.  \n -4- \nIntroduction \nSalinity is one of the major problems in irrigated agriculture all over the world. Many \nareas are facing reduced production as a result of salinity and, even worse, areas have \nbeen abandoned for any agricultural activity due to severe salinity levels. It is estimated \nthat roughly one-third of the irrigated land in the major irrigation countries is already \nbadly affected by salinity or is expected to become so in the near future (Kijne et al., \n1998). Some estimates for major irrigation countries are: Pakistan 14 percent, China 15 \npercent, India from 27 to 60 percent, Egypt 30 percent, and Iraq 50 percent (Ghassemi \net al., 1995). Two major salinity problems are likely to occur in irrigated areas if no \ncareful irrigation management is applied. First of all, salts will accumulate in the soil as \nirrigation  water  always  contains  some  salts,  while  water  transpired  by  plants  or \nevaporated  by  the  soil  will  not  remove  any  salts.  In  an  attempt  to  reduce  this  salt \naccumulation, a surplus of irrigation water is supplied to leach these salts from the root \nzone.  This  leads  in  many  cases  to  a  second  problem,  water  logging  due  to  rising \ngroundwater. Often, this groundwater is also very saline and will increase the salinity \nlevel of the root zone substantially. So, irrigation applications must be large enough to \nminimize salt accumulation in the root zone and low enough to limit the hazard of water \nlogging. Obviously, problems related to water logging can also be diminished by an \nadequate drainage system. \nField  trials  can  be  useful  to  analyze  and  test  different  scenarios  related  to  salinity. \nHowever, several important limitations of these field experiments have become more \nand more apparent. First of all, their validity is limited to the area and the physical \nconditions  the  experiments  have  been  conducted.  Secondly,  field  trials  are  often \nconducted over a short period of a couple of years, ignoring a very important topic in \nsalinity  related  problems:  the  long-term  effects.  These  long-term  effects  can  be  a \ngradual, but constant, salt accumulation in the root zone and the groundwater, as well as \nin rising or falling water tables. Finally, the number of scenarios that can be studied by \nfield experiments is necessary limited, given practical considerations as labor input, \navailable  fields,  and  noticeable  expenses.  Simulation  models  can  be  applied  as  an \nextension of field tests to overcome these restrictions of field experiments. Nowadays, \nwell-tested and validated simulation models are available and are ready to be applied to \nanswer questions related to salinity.  \nFor the Rudasht irrigation project in the Zayandeh Rud basin in Iran a rapid assessment \nprocedure  was  tested  based  on  the  SWAP  model;  a  physically  based,  well-tested \nsimulation  model  for  crop  growth,  water  and  salt  transport  at  field  scale.  No \nmeasurement campaign was conducted but data from an existing data set was used. \nEmphasis will be put on the output from the model in terms of long term effects, spatial \nand temporal resolution, expected crop yields, and water and salt balances.  \nIn summary the objectives of this paper are to demonstrate the possibility of making \ncombined  use  of  data  and  a  simulation  model  for  a  rapid  assessment  of  salinity \nproblems. This approach was tested by analyzing the water and salt balance and yields \nin relation to the quantity and quality of water applied for irrigation. \n -5- \nMaterials and methods \nStudy area \nThe Rudasht irrigation project (52\no lon., 32.5\no lat) is located east of Esfahan in the \ncentral part of Iran and has an altitude of approximately 1500 m (Fig. 1). The climate is \narid with temperatures ranging from 30\noC in summer down to 3\noC in winter. Average \nannual precipitation is 150  mm. Soils in the area are alluvial deposits and  are  fine \ntextured.  The  old  irrigation  system  will  be  expanded,  which  will  result  in  a  total \ncommand area of approximately 47,000 ha. Main crops are winter wheat and barley, \nsugar beet, cotton and melons.  \n \nSimulation model \nThe Soil-Water-Atmosphere-Plant (SWAP) model was applied to simulate all the terms \nof the water and salt balance and to estimate relative yields (actual over potential yield). \nSWAP is an integrated physically based simulation model for water, solute and heat \ntransport in the saturated-unsaturated zone in relation to crop growth. For this study the  \nwater and salt transport and crop growth modules were used. The first version of the \nSWAP model was already written in 1978 (Feddes et al., 1978) and from then on a \ncontinuous  development  of  the  program  started.  The  version  used  for  this  study  is \nSWAP2.0 and is described by Van Dam et al. (1997). \n \nTehran\nEsfahan\nRudasht\nTurkmenistan\nAfghanistan\nPaki-\nstan\nPersian\nGulf Saudi\nArabia\nKuwait\nIraq\n0 0 0\n0 500 km\n \nFigure 1. Location of the Roodhast area in the Esfahan region, Iran. \n -6- \nThe core part of the program is the vertical flow of water in the unsaturated-saturated \nzone, which can be described by the well-known Richards\u2019 equation: \n \n\u00b6q\n\u00b6\n\u00b6\n\u00b6\nq\n\u00b6\n\u00b6 t z\nK\nh\nz\nS h = + \u00e6\n\u00e8 \u00e7\n\u00f6\n\u00f8 \u00f7 -\n\u00e9\n\u00eb\n\u00ea\n\u00f9\n\u00fb\n\u00fa ( ) ( ) 1   (1) \nwhere q denotes the soil water content (cm\n3 cm\n-3), t is time (d), h  (cm) the soil matric \nhead,  z  (cm)  the  vertical  coordinate,  taken  positive  upwards,  K  the  hydraulic \nconductivity as a function of water content (cm d\n-1). S (d\n-1) represents the water uptake \nby plant roots (Feddes et al., 1978), defined in case of an uniform root distribution as: \n \nr\npot\nz\nT\nh h S ) ( ) ( a =   (2) \nwith Tpot is potential transpiration (cm d\n-1), zr is rooting depth (cm), and a (-) is a \nreduction factor as function of h and accounts for water deficit and oxygen deficit. \nExcept for the very wet conditions, unlimited water uptake by plants was at h > -1000 \ncm Between these points and permanent wilting point, h = -5000 cm, a linear reduction \nwas assumed. Below h = -5000 cm water uptake was assumed to be zero. Total actual \ntranspiration, Tact, was calculated as the depth integral of the water uptake function S. \nActual soil evaporation can be estimated by the Richards\u2019 equation using the potential \nevaporation as the upper boundary condition. However, this requires information about \nthe soil hydraulic properties of the first few centimeters of the soil, which are hardly \nmeasurable and are highly variable in time as a consequence of rain, crust and crack \nformation, and cultivation (Van Dam et al, 1997). All these processes reduce the real \nactual  evaporation  in  comparison  with  the  values  obtained  by  applying  Richards\u2019 \nequation.  Therefore  the  additional  soil  reduction  function  option  from  SWAP  was \nimplied, whereby the actual evaporation is a function of the potential evaporation, the \nsoil moisture content of the top soil, an empirical soil specific parameter, and the time \nsince the last significant rainfall. Details of this procedure are given by Boesten en \nStroosnijder (1986). \nCrop yields can be computed using a simple crop growth algorithm based on Doorenbos \nand Kassam (1979) or by using a detailed crop growth simulation module that partitions \nthe carbohydrates produced between the different parts of the plant, as a function of the \ndifferent phenological stages of the plant (Van Diepen et al. 1989). For this specific case \nthe  first  method  was  used  as  detailed  crop  parameters  were  lacking.  Potential \nevapotranspiration is partitioned into potential soil evaporation and crop transpiration \nusing the leaf area index. Actual crop transpiration and soil evaporation are obtained as \na function of the available soil water in the top layer or the root zone for, respectively, \nevaporation  and  transpiration.  Finally  irrigation  can  be  prescribed  at  fixed  times, \nscheduled according to different criteria, or by using a combination of both. \nSWAP can deal with solute transport processes in general. For salinity studies it can be \nassumed  that  salt  can  be  described  as  a  conservative  solute,  no  adsorption  or \ndecomposition, and diffusion rate is very small, so it can be ignored. This implies that \nsalt  transport  is  only  governed  by  the  convection-dispersion  process.  The  effect  of \nsalinity on crop yields is taken into account and is defined by a critical ECe level below \nwhich  no  salt  stress  occurs  and  the  decline  of  rootwater  uptake  above  this  ECe \nmaximum level in percentage crop yield reduction per dS m\n-1. For the cotton crop used -7- \nhere the ECe maximum is defined as 7.7 dS m\n-1 and the decline as 5% per dS m\n-1 \n(Doorenbos and Kassam, 1979). \nThe SWAP model has been applied and tested already for many different conditions and \nlocations and has been proven to produce reliable and accurate results. A more detailed \ndescription of the model and all its components is beyond the scope of this paper, but \ncan be found in Van Dam et al. (1997). \n \nInput data \nSoils \nIn order simulate the flow of water the soil hydraulic functions, water retention and \nhydraulic conductivity curves, are required. These soil hydraulic functions are often not \navailable  and,  moreover,  require  specific  equipment  to  determine  these  properties. \nPedo-transfer functions can be used to derive these difficult-to-measure soil hydraulic \nfunctions from easily obtainable data such as texture and soil bulk density (e.g. Tietje \nand Tapkenhinrichs 1993). Recently, W\u00f6sten et al. (1998) developed a set of pedo-\ntransfer functions using a soil database including data of 4030 horizons. These pedo-\ntransfer functions were used to obtain the soil hydraulic properties required as described \naccording the Mualem-Van Genuchten equations (Van Genuchten, 1980). Variation in \nsoil properties was limited in the area and therefore only one soil type was considered. \nTable  1  shows  the  measured  soil  properties  and  the  derived  soil  hydraulic \ncharacteristics. \nThe soil hydraulic characteristics for the top three layers are depicted in Figure 2. The \nwater holding capacity of the top soil is substantially higher than the ones from the \ndeeper soil layers. Assuming values for field capacity as pF 2.0 and for wilting point as \npF 4.0, the water holding capacity is 0.21, 0.21 and 0.13 cm\n3\n cm\n-3 for respectively 0-30, \n30-55 and 55-75 cm depths. Also hydraulic conductivity is higher for the top layers than \nfor the deeper layers. \n \n0.00 0.20 0.40 0.60\nMoisture content (m3 m-3)\n100\n101\n102\n103\n104\nP\nr\ne\ns\ns\nu\nr\ne\n \nh\ne\na\nd\n \n(\n-\nc\nm\n)\n100 101 102 103 104\nPressure head (-cm)\n10-7\n10-6\n10-5\n10-4\n10-3\n10-2\n10-1\n100\n101\n102\nH\ny\nd\nr\na\nu\nl\ni\nc\n \nc\no\nn\nd\nu\nc\nt\ni\nv\ni\nt\ny\n \n(\nc\nm\n \nd\n-\n1\n)\n  0-30 cm\n30-55 cm\n55-75 cm\n \nFigure 2.

SWAP requires daily input data so it was assumed that \nthe daily data was similar as the monthly average ones. In addition, for rainfall the \nmonthly maximum and the day this maximum occurred, was available, and was used in \nSWAP. This ensured us that the most variable meteorological factor was correctly taken \ninto account in the simulations. \nAs  we  are  interested  in  the  long  term  effects  of  different  scenarios  we  used  one \nreference year and applied this over a period of 10 years in order to get the equilibrium \nstage. The selection of one reference year was done by considering the total annual \nprecipitation as well as the distribution of this precipitation during the year. Table 2 \nshows the characteristics of the entire data set from which was decided to select 1991 as \nthe reference year. \nTable 2.

For this study \nwe selected to analyze the effect of different irrigation management scenarios on cotton. \nCotton is seeded at the beginning of April and yield is harvested at the beginning of -9- \nOctober. Potential yields for cotton in this area is around 5000 kg ha\n-1, but actual yields \nare frequently reported to be only halve of this due to salinity problems. \n \nBottom boundary condition \nGroundwater levels are reported to be around 200 cm below surface, but may increase \nsubstantially during the irrigation season. A bottom flux groundwater relationship was \nused here, as this is appropriate to evaluate changes in water table depths. No detailed \ndata was available for this, so a general exponential relationship was used: \n \nh b\nbot ae q =   (3) \nwhere a and b are empirical coefficients, here defined as \u20130.3 cm d\n-1 and \u20130.01 cm\n-1, \nrespectively. These values result in a water table behavior comparable to the reported \nqualitative field observations: a water table depth of around 200 cm and some water \nlogging after substantial irrigation applications. \n \nIrrigation \nIrrigation applications according to normal farmer practices are very high in an attempt \nto  compensate  for  the  poor  water  quality.  For  cotton  a  total  application  will  reach \nbetween  800  and  1000  mm,  given  in  quantities  of  about  100  mm.  As  no  detailed \ninformation was available on the exact date of irrigation applications, it was assumed \nthat farmers irrigated the crop at the most appropriate time. This was performed by \nusing a timing criterion in the SWAP model, based on the ratio of actual over potential \ncrop  transpiration  (Tcrit).  By  changing  this  criterion  in  the  range  from  0.3  to  0.95, \ndifferent amount of irrigation will be simulated. Each application was assumed to be \nconstant at 100 mm which was in accordance with local farm practice. \nWater quality was very poor with reported salinity levels between 2 and 6 dS m\n-1. As no \ntrend was apparent in these levels during the year, we assumed here a constant level of 4 \ndS m\n-1. \n \nScenarios \nIn order to explore the effect of different water management decisions, scenarios were \ndefined. The first scenario is the baseline scenario, which describes the current situation, \nand will function as a reference for the other scenarios. The other scenarios are based on \nchanges in water quantity and quality and their effect on the water and salt balance and \ncrop yields. \n \nBaseline  \nThe baseline is used as a reference and can be considered as the \u2018business as usual\u2019 \ncase. The cotton crop was considered, as this is an important industrial crop in the area, \nalso in the perspective of the renewal and expansion of the system. Irrigation inputs \nwere used as applied by the average farmer and includes a total of 900 mm as defined \nbefore. The salinity of the irrigation water was considered to be constant during the year -10- \nof 4 dS m\n-1. No drainage was considered and the groundwater depth was simulated \nusing the flux-groundwater relationship as described before.  \nIn order to focus on long term effects and analyze an equilibrium state, a period of 10 \nyears was considered for which all the input data was kept constant. Also weather data \nwas kept similar for these 10 years, in order to avoid disturbance from extreme weather \nconditions. Obviously, extreme weather conditions exist in reality and can be studied in \ndetail using a historic range of climate data to explore the probability of occurrence of \ncertain conditions. This is beyond the scope of this paper, as we want to explore long \nterm effects only, but can be found elsewhere (e.g. Droogers et al., 1999). \n \nWater quantity \nThe baseline irrigation applications were defined by 9 times an application of 100 mm. \nAs  a  result  of  changes  in  upstream  management,  inter-basin  flows,  or  irrigation \ndevelopment, more or less water could become available for the scheme, or, moreover, \na change in the cropped area in the scheme itself can change the water availability for \nirrigation at field level. In order to distribute the water of the different scenarios as \noptimally as possible an irrigation scheduling criterion from SWAP was used based on \nthe ratio actual over potential crop transpiration. Different ratios, ranging from 0.3 to \n0.95, were used, resulting in total irrigation application between 300 and 1500 mm. \nResults of these simulations were compared with the baseline scenario of a total of 900 \nmm water applied. \n \nWater quality \nAs a consequence of changes in upstream water utilization and management, salinity \nlevels in the river can change. To explore the effect of these changes, simulations were \nperformed with decreased salinity levels (1 and 2 dS m\n-1), which occurs as a result of \nthe development of inter-basin flows. The development of more irrigation upstream of \nthe Rudasht area, could lead to a further deterioration of water quality and therefore a \nscenario was analyzed using an increased salinity level of 6 dS m\n-1. All the other input \nparameters were assumed to be unchanged. \nTable 3.

This  equilibrium  stage  was  reached  by \napplying the model for a period of 10 years while keeping all the input data constant. It \nappears  that  this  equilibrium  stage  was  reached  already  after  5  years  for  the  water \nbalance and the topsoil salinity levels. However, groundwater salinity levels were just \nreaching an almost equilibrium stage after these 10 years, at a level of about 27 dS m\n-1. \nFrom table 3 is appears that the irrigation application was almost equal to the potential \ntranspiration. However, part of this irrigated water could not be used directly by the \ncrop, as a consequence of percolation to the groundwater and losses by soil evaporation. \nFigure 3 shows the daily trend in the water balance. Irrigation inputs were 900 mm, \naccording to normal field practices. As the exact dates of the irrigation applications \nwere  unknown,  we  allowed  the  model  to  distribute  this  900  mm  as  optimally  as \npossible.  \nThis  was  accomplished  by  setting  the  Tcrit  (the  ratio  of  actual  over  potential  crop \ntranspiration) to the value that simulated this 900 mm. After some trials a value of 0.63 \nappeared to be appropriate. Clearly the rise in groundwater due to irrigation with the \nassociated negative aspects of water logging can be seen. Interesting is that during the \npeak growing season, June-August, water is not the limiting factor as can be seen from \nthe high water table, but the crop is being stressed due to salinity and some aeration \nproblems related to the high water table. \nTable 4.

Water and salinity profiles for the baseline scenario at equilibrium stage \nfor one year for the top soil as simulated using SWAP. -13- \nThe SWAP model offers the opportunity to evaluate processes in unlimited spatial and \ntemporal resolution. As an example, Figure 4 shows the soil moisture status and the \nsolute concentrations for one year for the top soil. Water contents higher than pF 1.0, h \n= -10 cm, are considered to be negative for the plant as water uptake is restricted due to \naeration problems. From pF 3.0 crops stress started and no water uptake by roots take \nplace if the soil is dryer than pF 4.0. From Figure 4 it is clear that the irrigation input is \njust low enough to prevent the soil of severe drying out and not too high to cause water \nlogging problems. The salinity levels (Fig. 4 bottom) are constant for the lower soil \nprofile, but major variations can be observed in top soil salinity levels. Interesting is that \na substantial salt accumulation has been developed in the lower soil layers, with values \naround 25 dS m\n-1, while irrigation water had a salinity level of 4 dS m\n-1. Note that \nsalinity levels presented here reflect the actual levels for the current soil water, while \nfield measurement are normally based on a soil sample brought to saturation. \n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\nm\nm\n400 600 800 1000 1200 1400\nIrrigation Inputs (mm)\n20\n40\n60\n80\n%\n400 600 800 1000 1200 1400\nPercolation\nRunoff\nSoil Evaporation\nCrop Transpiration\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\nm\nm\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\nd\nS\n \nm\n-\n1\nRelative Yield\nTop-soil Salinity\n \nFigure 5. The effect of changes in water quantities applied by irrigation on the soil \nwater balance, crop yields and soil salinity levels. \n \nChanges in water quantity \nThe effect of a change in irrigation supplies in terms of total amount applied water, was \nanalyzed using the result of the SWAP model (Table 4). In Figure 5 the relationship \nbetween water applied and the annual terms of the water balance, expected crop yields \nand soil salinity are displayed. Runoff is zero as long as annual irrigation applications -14- \nare  lower  than  900  mm.  Higher  irrigation  applications  will  increase  this  runoff \nnoticeably. An almost linear relationship exists between the amount of water applied by \nirrigation and the amount of percolation, with a slope of 25%. Soil evaporation is also \nlinear related to the irrigation supply. Crop transpiration and relative yields reach their \ntop at an irrigation input of about 1000 mm. A higher supply will reduce the soil salinity \nlevels slightly, but will cause water logging with all the negative aspects associated with \nthis.  \nIn general it appears that the current practice of applying 900 mm of irrigation is close \nto the optimal amount. However, with increasing competition of water less water might \nbecome available for irrigation in the near future. Results displayed in Table 4, can be \nused to estimate the expected crop yields given a certain amount of water available for \nirrigation. With the current water management crop yields are about 65% of potential, \nwhile this can drop to 50 and 40 % for respectively 700 and 500 mm of irrigation. \n \n1 2 3 4 5 6\n600\n800\n1000\n1200\nI\nr\nr\ni\ng\na\nt\ni\no\nn\n \nD\ne\np\nt\nh\n \n(\nm\nm\n \ny\n-\n1\n)\n1 2 3 4 5 6\n600\n800\n1000\n1200\n1 2 3 4 5 6\nIrrigation Water Salinity (dS m-1)\n600\n800\n1000\n1200\n1 2 3 4 5 6\n600\n800\n1000\n1200\nRelative Yield (%)\nPercolation (mm yr-1) Surface Runoff (mm y-1)\nTop Soil Salinity (dS m-1)\n \nFigure 6.

Obviously,  lower  salinity  levels  result  in  higher  yields  and \ntranspiration rates, and lower runoff and soil salinity levels. The increase in percolation \ncan be explained by the fact that water uptake by plant roots is hampered by the high \nsalinity levels, resulting in more water available for percolation. Moreover, due to this \nlower transpiration the water table will rise and runoff will occur.  \nTable 5. Effect of the changes in irrigation water quality on yields and salt and \nwater balance.

Figure 6 shows for \nirrigation depths ranging from 500 to 1300 mm y\n-1 and for salinity levels from 1 to 6 dS \nm\n-1  the  resulting  expected  relative  yields.  As  can  be  observed  from  the  figure,  the \nhighest yield can be expected for an irrigation depth of 1100 mm with a salinity level of \n1 dS m\n-1. For other combinations of water quantity and quality values, expected yields \ncan be obtained using this figure too. Furthermore, all other terms of the water and salt \nbalance  can  be  analyzed  for  the  different  possible  water  quantity  and  quality \ncombinations. \nIn Figure 6 the top soil salinity, surface runoff, and percolation are given as examples. \nSalinity levels are lowest with irrigation applications of about 1100 mm and increase \nwith higher application rates as a consequence of water logging. As explained before, \nsalinity levels presented here, reflect the top 100 cm average values in the actual soil \nwater, and thus not the levels for a saturated soil.  \nBelow an annual application rate of about 1000 mm surface runoff is negligible, while \nat higher rates and high salinity levels root water uptake is hampered, water table rises, \ninducing significant runoff. Finally, expected percolation to the groundwater as function \nof the annual water application and salinity levels can be observed at the right-bottom in \nFigure 6. Percolation rates are between almost zero and 280 mm y\n-1. \n \nGeneralization \nThe SWAP model offers a range of output that can be used to understand processes and \nto analyze the impact of different scenarios on field water management aspects. In cases \nwhere  only  the  relationship  between  irrigation  inputs  and  yield  is  required,  more \ngeneralized and simplified models can be used. Instead of using a classical irrigation \nresearch  approach  involving  experimental  field  trials  with  different  irrigation -16- \napplications, we used the SWAP model here as a \u201cvirtual field\u201d. The main advantage \nover field trials is the unlimited amount of \u201cexperiments\u201d that can be performed using \nthe  model.  For  this  study  52  different  \u201cexperiments\u201d  have  been  conducted:  the \ncombination of 13 application depths and 4 salinity levels. \nA range of regression equations has been tested to relate irrigation applications and \nsalinity levels to relative yields, as simulated by the SWAP model. Table 6 shows the \nregression equation used, and the resulting Sum Of Squares (SSQ) and the correlation \ncoefficient  r\n2.  Tests  with  higher  degree  regression  equations  did  not  improve  the \npredictions,  but  the  additional  term  Salinity  times  Irrigation,  improved  the  fit \nsubstantially.  Figure  7  shows  the  scatter  diagram  for  this  regression  equation  (last \nequation  in  Table  6).  The  obtained  functions  should  be  used  with  care  as  they  are \nderived  from  one  soil  type,  one  climatological  condition,  and  one  crop  (cotton). \nExtension to other crops and soil types are under study. \nTable 6.

Given \nthe current water quality level, changes in the amount of irrigation applied will not \nchange substantially crop yields and the current practice of 900 mm is recommended for \ncotton. \nIf water quality improves due to changes in water management upstream of Rudasht to \n2 dS m\n-1 or even 1 dS m\n-1, yields can increase to 73% and 77%, respectively, of the \npotential  value,  with  the  same  annual  irrigation  application  of  900  mm.  A  further \nincrease is possible if along with an improvement in water quality, more water becomes \navailable for irrigation. Expected yields can increase to 87% and 95% for respectively 2 \nand  1  dS  m\n-1,  if  an  annual  application  rate  of  1100  mm  is  practiced.  A  further \nsalinization of irrigation water to 6 dS m\n-1, will decrease the crop yield for cotton to \n51% of potential obtainable.  \nThe results presented here can be used also to assess the effect of sub-optimal irrigation \napplications on yields and the water and salt balance. Figure 6 top-left can be used as a \nguideline to estimate expected yields given the salinity level of irrigation water and the \nannual applied irrigation amount. \nResults from this study reflect the situation for the representative soil type considered \nhere  and  for  average  farmer  practice  and  weather  conditions.  Variation  in  these \nparameters is likely to change the results and conclusions. However, the input data used \nhere  reflects  the  average  conditions  and  results  can  be  used  as  general  guidelines. \nFurthermore, limitations as a result of water stress, water logging, and salinity were \ntaken into account, but other possible limitations, such as weeds, diseases, and improper \nmanagement, were neglected here. \nThe main advantage of the approach applied here is that it is a nonspecific one and can \nbe easily adapted to other conditions in terms of soil, weather, and crop. The study \npresented was setup to demonstrate the use of existing models, data, and techniques for \na rapid assessment. Input data for the current study was readily available and required \ndata  was  obtained  by  converting  the  existing  data  to  the  required  ones  in  stead  of \nstarting extensive measurement efforts. The use of an existing well-tested simulation \nmodel and well-established data conversion methods was assumed to generate reliable \nresults.  The  nature  of  the  model,  physically  based,  enabled  this  approach  as  no \ncalibration is required by field tests and the input data needed is physically sound. \nThe  model  was  applied  here  in  an  input  driven  mode,  i.e.  ignoring  the  impact  of \nirrigation management on downstream users. As the irrigation scheme studied here was \nlocated at the lower part of the river with no downstream users, this downstream effect \ncould be ignored. In cases where downstream users are present and reuse of water is \nrelevant, the evaluation can be extended using output produced by the model, such as \nsurface runoff and percolation in terms of quantity as well as quality. \nBesides the benefits of this non-specific approach, the methodology applied here gives a \nwealth of information in comparison to field trials, in terms of spatial and temporal -18- \nresolution  as  well  as  in  terms  of  difficult  to  measure  processes  such  as  crop \ntranspiration, soil evaporation, and percolation.  \n \nAcknowledgements \nThanks to Mr. Feizi from the Soil and Water Research Institute, Esfahan, for providing \ndata used in this study. \n \n \nReferences \nBoesten, J.J.T.I., and L.
