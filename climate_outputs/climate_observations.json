    "abstract": "This is an overview of the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) project at Sachs Harbour on Banks Island, Northwest Territories, Canada, an effort to document the problem of Arctic climate change as experienced by the Inuit living there. There is video commentary by Inuit in which they describe changes in daily life for animals and people at Sachs Harbour: banks caving from permafrost melt, seasonal changes and new types of animals appearing as the old familiar animals disappear, ice dangerously opening up, and most importantly, a new unpredictability added to the usual extreme weather conditions in the Arctic region. The video comes in an abbreviated version, 14 minutes in length, as well as the full version, which is 42 minutes in length. There are reports of IISD trips made during different seasons at Sachs Harbour, a teacher guide for the video, and a report on the climate observations discussed in the IISD: Inuit Observations on Climate Change workshop. Educational levels: High school, Undergraduate lower division",

Summary categories \u2013 Group one. \nChanges in birds \nFish and sea life \nWeather patterns \nInsects \nHarvesting problems \n1.  Changes in birds  \n \nCauses for changes in birds were suggested to be warmer weather and the increased numbers \nof insects as a food source. It was indicated that changes observed in bird species are fairly \nrecent, within the last five years. \nTwo points identified effects of these changes. First, it was indicated that increased \npopulations of species such as snow geese were going to lead to the population eventually \neating itself out of food and declining. Second, the potential for ecotourism was identified \nwith the availability of new and different types of birds (Note: Banks Island has a large \nmigratory bird sanctuary.) \n \n2. Fish and sea life \n \nCauses for changes in fish and sea life were suggested to be a result of warmer water\u2014\nwarmer currents were seen to bring new species. It was also suggested that there was \nincreased plant life in the water. Observations of fewer mature seals was attributed to less ice \nflow. \n \nEffects of changes in fish and sea life were summarized as concern over less ice and young \nbearded seals being separated from their mothers and starving. It also meant that it was \nharder to hunt mature seals. \n \n3. Weather patterns \n \nCauses for change and variability of weather were summarized as being attributed to warmer \nweather, intense weather and sudden changes, as well as more wind and freezing rain. It was \nalso attributed to shorter winters, early thaws and deeper permafrost. \n \nEffects of these changes were identified as damage to buildings and impacts on houses and \nwindows with the problem of softer ground, shifting ground, as well as health problems \nsuch as skin rashes. Changes in weather patterns were seen to represent a need to adopt new \nhunting strategies, and also a threat to animal populations through starvation. \nIISD: Inuit Observations on Climate Change \u2013Trip Report 1, Page 12 \n \n \n4. Insects \n \nCauses for changes in insects were attributed to shorter winters, longer summers and more \nwater.  \n \nEffects of more insects were summarized as resulting in more birds and different birds, \nwhich was seen to represent a possible tourism option. More insects were also seen as a \npotential source of disease in both animals and humans. \n \n5. Harvesting problems \n \nDifficulties with harvesting was not identified as a summary card in the previous component \nof the workshop; however, it was identified in this portion of the workshop as being an \nimportant summary of observations. \n \nCauses of harvesting problems were summarized as the lack of snow in spring, the lack of \nice in summer, increased freezing rain, increased summer rain, later freeze-ups, thinner ice \nand increased open water in winter.  \n \nEffects of harvesting problems were identified as forcing changes to harvesting dates and \ntimes, as well as difficulties getting to and from hunting areas. Specifically, it was suggested \nthat the polar bear hunt might decline. Further impacts were summarized as effects on \nanimal populations such as population collapses from overpopulation and disease. Further \ndeclines in fur prices were also identified. \n \nTable 3.

Summary categories \u2013 Group two. \n \nInsects \nFish \nSeasons  \nLand animals \nIce conditions \nBirds \n1. Insects \n \nCauses for changes observed in insects were summarized as attributable to warmer weather \nand earlier springs. It was also suggested that some of the different species observed may be \narriving on barges. \n \nEffects of different insects and changes in numbers of insects were identified as a nuisance \nto the community, and as increasing the potential for illness in people and animals. \n \n2. Fish \n \nChanges in fish populations and species composition were described as possibly attributed to \nlarger fish sizes and the presence of more bowhead and walrus, as well as warmer water. \n \nIISD: Inuit Observations on Climate Change \u2013Trip Report 1, Page 14 \n \n \nPotential effects of change in fish were identified as representing possible increases in variety \nof food for human consumption. \n \n3. Seasons \n \nChanges and fluctuations in seasons were suggested to be a result of a thinner ozone layer, \nwarmer winters, early springs, late falls and hotter summers. Discussion of causes also \nbrought out more discussion of more humid weather, permafrost melt, wind bursts, erosion, \nmore thunderstorms, bigger vegetation and disruption of radio frequencies.  \n \nEffects of changes in seasons were identified as disruptions in land travel, cutbacks to sport \nhunting season and buildings being shifted, as well as skin problems. \n \n4. Land animals \n \nChanges in land animals were suggested to be a result of shortages of food and short length \nof seasons. It is also observed that this may also be causing animals to be deformed. \nAdditionally, change in populations (growth and decline) and animals being born earlier are \nattributed to changes in weather patterns.  \n \nEffects of changes to land animals are identified as overgrazing and as overpopulation of \nmusk oxen and a resulting decrease in caribou. \n \n5. Ice conditions \n \nChanges to ice conditions are suggested to be caused by warmer weather, especially in \nsummer. Under causes of changes, participants also listed observations of thinner ice in \nlakes, polar icepack movement farther away, no ice flows in summer and less multi-year ice. \n \nEffects of changing ice conditions were primarily associated with impacts on traditional \nharvesting. Increased difficulty of spring travel from ice conditions was viewed to disturb the \ncommunity harvesting ability. \n6. Birds \n \nIn identifying possible causes of changes in bird life, participants discussed warmer weather \nleading to overpopulation and overgrazing. Observations of different bird species were said \nto have been primarily in the last five years (same as Group one). \n \nEffects of changes in bird life were described in terms of a shorter hunting season, as well as \ndeformities and disease in birds. \n \n \nIISD: Inuit Observations on Climate Change \u2013Trip Report 1, Page 15 \n \nFigure 1. Sample summary card and cause and effect exercise illustration. \n \n \n \nThe final exercise of the workshop for day one involved dividing the participants once again \ninto two groups. Group one was to place the climate change observations from earlier \nexercises on an annual calendar, along with significant cultural and traditional events. Group \ntwo was to produce a timeline back to the beginning of living memory (and farther with oral \ntraditions), listing important events in Sachs Harbour as well as significant environmental \nchanges in wildlife, weather, plant life and livelihood system. \n \nThe younger community members were asked to prepare the annual  \ncalendar, the older members the timeline. The younger people, \nhowever, preferred to not divide the workshop into two groups\u2014\nthey wanted to see what the older community members and elders \nwould do with the timeline. The community as a whole would do \nthe annual calendar the next day. \n \n \nTo view the results of the timeline exercise, see \nhttp://iisd.ca/pdf/inuittimeline.pdf.   \n \nIISD: Inuit Observations on Climate Change \u2013Trip Report 1, Page 16 \n \n \nThe timeline exercise, as with earlier exercises, illustrated that the Inuvialuit of Banks Island \nhave been experiencing environmental and weather-related change most noticeably since the \nmid-1980s.  \n \n \n \nWorkshop Results \u2013 Day Two \n \nAgenda: Ranking \n  Annual activity calendar \n  Trip planning \n  Community representative \n  Dyanna staying in community \n  Thank you payments \n  Payment to Hamlet for using office \n \n \nThe first workshop exercise of day two was designed \nto rank the categories of change, as determined by \nthe participants, in order of concern to the \ncommunity. A list of indicator categories was \ncompiled from the group work the day before. Each \ncommunity member participating was given five dots \nto stick on the list of indicators. Dots represented \nimportance. It was explained that you could stick all \ndots on one indicator or spread them out. The \nresults of the exercise are as follows: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTable 5.

This annual calendar identified \ntimes and dates of seasonal activities and \nsignificant events. The calendar was used by \nthe community and the team to identify the \nbest times to capture changes experienced by \nthe Inuvialuit and, therefore, the key times for \nthe team to return the community.  \n \nThe exercise identified key times as the weeks \nwhen the seasons are changing as well as times \nof significant traditional activity. The period \nfrom late July to early August, when the \ncommunity is summer gill-net fishing and seal \nhunting, was identified as a significant time to \nreturn to the community, as well as the period \nfrom the end of October to the second week of November, during the annual musk ox \nharvest, ice fishing time, caribou hunting, male-only polar bear hunt and the fall freeze-up. \nThe third time identified was the beginning to end of May, for the spring goose hunt. \n \n \nIn the 1960s it used to be \u201370\u00b0C with the wind.

INTRODUCTION \nI got a little worried yesterday afternoon when I \nstarted to think about what talk I could give today. \nI had brought a pile of viewgraphs from my office, \nthinking that I would be able to select several to \nmake a decent talk - with the idea of comparing \npossible solar-forced climate change with climate \nchange due to other forcings, and comparing all of \nthese with unforced climate fluctuations. That may \nsound o.k., but when I looked at my viewgraphs, \nthey seemed pretty dull to me. \nHowever, after thinking about them awhile, I \nrealized that they lead to a remarkable conclusion, \none with political and social implications. And, \nsurprisingly, the result derives, in part, from the \nlittle one-tenth of one percent change in the solar \nirradiance measured by Dick Willson, which is \nusually dismissed as of no climatic importance. \nSo if you stick it through, you may find the \nconclusion interesting. I can't guarantee that I will \nconvince you of the conclusion. But I'm pretty sure \nthat it is right. In fact, if you disagree with it, I \nwould be happy to make a friendly little wager-one \nwhich much of the community apparently believes to \nbe very improbable, so perhaps it's a good chance for \nyou to take my money. \n2. OBSERVED CLIMATE VARIABILITY \nThe first viewgraph (Fig. I )  shows temperature \nvariations over the past 160,000 years, as inferred \nfrom isotopes in an ice core from Antarctica. The \ntemperature thus refers to this specific region, at the \nlevel in the atmosphere where the snow formed. \nA smoothed estimate of global temperature over \nthe same period is shown in Figure 2. Global \ntemperature fluctuates on this time scale by about 5C \n*This paper is the talk given by one of us (JEH) at the conference \nClimate Impact of Solar Variability, NASA Goddard Space Flight \nCenter, Greenbelt, Maryland, April 25, 1990, with two added \nexplanatory notes. \nThousands of Years Ago \nFig. 1.

Twentieth century data points are based on Keeling's \nmeasurements. \nbetween the interglacial periods and the depths of \nthe glacial periods. Similar oscillations of global \ntemperature have occurred many times over the past \nfew million years. \nThese glacial to interglacial climate fluctuations \nappear to be related to a certain type of solar \nvariation - the seasonal and geographical \nredistribution of insolation caused by changes in the \nEarth's orbital elements (the eccentricity of the orbit, \nthe tilt of the spin axis, and the season of periapsis). \nSpecifically, a high correlation is found between the \nclimate changes and the changes of the Earth orbital \nelements, and thus the latter are called the \n\"pacemakers of the ice ages.\" \nHowever, the orbital changes by themselves \ncause very little net heating or cooling averaged over \nthe year and over the planet. The mechanisms which \nmaintain the global temperature can be investigated \nby examining the glacial to interglacial change of the \nhttps://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19910003164 2020-03-24T06:51:40+00:00Z\nUIUUUI IVICUII ~c l l lp~ra ture  \ntc- 2025 \nI I !

It turns out that the \nprincipal factors maintaining the ice age cold were, \n(1) the increased area of ice sheets and snow, which \nreflected sunlight to space, (2) decreased amounts of \natmospheric carbon dioxide and methane, which re- \nduced the greenhouse effect, and (3) increased \namounts of aerosols and dust, which also reflected \nsunlight. \nMost likely, these mechanisms were feedbacks, \nthat is processes which amplified a tendency for \nclimate change driven by the earth orbital elements \nor ~ t h e r  factors. Indeed, although the fluctuations \nappear to be almost synchronous (Fig. l) ,  the carbon \ndioxide change usually lags slightly behind the \ntemperature change, as expected for a feedback. \nFigure 3 shows global temperature on the 100 \nyear time scale, based on the network of \nmeteorological stations. There are several issues \nabout this record, especially ( I )  whether the station \ncoverage is adequate to estimate global trends, and \n(2) whether the station records contain systematic \nbiases, such as urban warming. The error due to \nincomplete spatial coverage can be estimated quite \nwell from knowledge of spatial and temporal vari- \nability of temperature and has been shown to be \nreasonably small, as indicated by the error bars \n(Fig. 3). Urban effects on the global temperature \nchange have been estimated in several different ways \nand found to be not larger than 0.1-0.2C. \nIt is apparent that over the full century there is \na substantial warming trend. However, within that \nperiod there are intervals of cooling, most notably \nthe cooling trend from about 1940 to 1970. There \nare also year to year fluctuations as large as a few \ntenths of a degree. Within the 1980s the maxima in \n1983 and 1987-88 are associated with major El \n~ i n o s ,  as evidenced by the spatial pattern of the \nwarming. \nNote that there is no significant trend of global \ntemperature within the 1980s. Recently great \npublicity was given to an apparently surprising \nresult: \"satellites find no warming in the 1980s.\" \nThis statement was bound to deceive the public, \nbecause of all the prior publicity about the 1980s \nDate \nFig. 3.

In reality, of \ncourse, there was no contradiction with the previous \nfindings; the satellite record was simply too brief to \nbe used for studying long term trends. \nAlso note that even the investigators' optimistic \nestimate of the satellite error as being O.OOSC/year \nClimate fluctuates without any change of climate \nforcing. The climate fluctuations arise because the \ncoupled non-linear equations describing atmospheric \nstructure and motion are unstable to small \nperturbations.

Some of the sloshing, \nfor example, the El Nino/Southern Oscillation \nphenomena, may be predictable on a limited time \nscale, but most of it is of a chaotic nature for which \nlong term prediction is only possible in a statistical \nsense. \nUnforced climate variability can be studied to a \ndegree with global climate models, even if the ocean \ndynamics is fixed. Figure 4 shows the global mean \ntemperature simulated in a 100 year run of our GCM \nTime (years)  \nFig. 5.

Several fast feedback \nprocesses, such as atmospheric water vapor amount, \ncloud cover, and sea ice distribution were free to \nvary, but the solar irradiance, atmospheric C 0 2  and \nother trace gases, and ice sheet area were fixed. The \nglobal mean temperature in this 100 year control run, \nwithout climate forcings, varied by as much as \nseveral tenths of a degree Celsius, with fluctuations \nfrom year to year as well as trends over periods of \ndecades. \nWe have also made a longer control run, without \nany change of climate forcings, with a slightly \nmodified version of our GCM (see Note 1). The \nglobal mean temperature in this longer run (Fig. 5) \nhas year to year and decadal variations, as in the 100 \nyear run (note that the compressed horizontal scale in \nFig. 5 makes the variations appear steeper), but it \nalso shows trends on longer time scales, such as the \ncooling from year 100 to year 250. \nIt's instructive to consider how these unforced \nclimate fluctuations would differ if we allowed \nadditional feedbacks to operate, particularly \nfeedbacks which are expected to be significant on \npaleoclimate time scales. Empirical data indicate \nthat on long time scales ice sheet area tends to \ndecrease with increasing global temperature, and the \nabundance of the greenhouse gases C02  and CH, \ntends to increase with increasing global temperature, \nso both mechanisms are probably positive feedbacks \non paleoclimate time scales. Changes of vegetation \ncover and atmospheric aerosol amount are more \nvariable, and do not appear to have as large a global \nimpact. Overall, it appears that long time scale \nfeedbacks could make unforced climate fluctuations \neven much larger than those in Figs. 4 and 5. It is \ndifficult to model the variations of these factors, \nbecause we do not understand the mechanisms well \nenough. But it is likely that unforced climate fluc- \ntuations are quite large on paleoclimate time scales. \nUnforced climate fluctuations complicate the \nsearch for any forced climate change such as may \narise from changes of solar irradiance and \nanthropogenic greenhouse gases. Changes of ice \nsheet area can be ignored on decadal time scales, and \nchanges of C 0 2  and CH4, although they may be in \npart a result of climate feedbacks, are known \naccurately from observations. But one variable \nignored in our climate simulations, fluctuations of \nocean heat transports, is clearly a significant \ncontributor to global temperature fluctuations. \nFor example, in the record of observed global \ntemperature for the past century (Fig. 3) the two \nmajor El Nifios of the past decade show up as rela- \ntive maxima in 1983 and 1987-88. Ocean transport \nvariability also probably contributes to some of the \nlonger time scale variability in this global \ntemperature record, but we have no proof of that. \nThe standard deviation of global annual mean \ntemperature in our GCM without forcing and with \nfixed ocean heat transports is about 0.1C. As \nexpected, the standard deviation for the observations \nis larger, being about 0.15C even if the long term \ntrend in the data is removed.

A \nsolar irradiance change of 0.1% yields a climate \nforcing equivalent to about a 15 ppm CO, change, \nwhile at its maximum the global climate forcing of \nEl Chichon aerosols was equivalent to a more than \n100 ppm CO, change. Of course greenhouse, aerosol \nand solar forcings of equal global magnitude would \nnot yield identical climate changes. But tests with \nour GCM using equivalent forcings, namely 2% solar \nconstant change, doubled CO,, and a change of \nstratospheric aerosol optical depth of 0.15, yielded \ngenerally similar global climate changes (with added \naerosols causing cooling).

Hoyt and H.L. Kyle (private \ncommunication) in a manuscript which will be \nsubmitted for publication. Uncertainties in data \nreduction and calibration, as well as significant \ndifferences between Nimbus 7, SMM and ERBE \nsolar irradiance data, highlight the difficulty in \nachieving the high accuracy needed for climate \nstudies. Adequate monitoring of long term solar \nchange requires having two well-calibrated radio- \nmeters in space simultaneously with frequent solar \nobservations, as discussed below.

However, that degree \nof variation is sufficient to leave the sun as a \ncandidate for causing the 1940- 1970 global cooling, \nif indeed that was a forced climate change. \nMoreover, a solar decline of 0.3%, if maintained on \na century time scale, would cause a cooling of about \n0.5C, if climate sensitivity is 3-4C for doubled CO,. \nSince 0.5C is about the magnitude of estimated \nglobal cooling during the Little Ice Age, the sun is a \nviable candidate for forcing that climate fluctuation. \nWe conclude that solar variability may be a \nsignificant climate forcing mechanism, so it is \nimportant to maintain accurate solar monitoring. \nUnfortunately, the most precise solar irradiance data \nterminated as the Solar Maximum Mission was \nbrought down by atmospheric drag in 1989.

The opinion has been expressed, in a \nreport of the Marshall Institute, that greenhouse \nwarming may be beneficial because it might just \ncancel cooling in the 21st century due to a declining \nsolar irradiance. But it is apparent that the \nequivalent of doubled CO,, which is expected by the \nmiddle of next century if there are no reductions in \ngreenhouse gas emissions, would require that solar \nirradiance decline by 2% to counter the greenhouse \nclimate forcing. While such a solar decline is not \nstrictly impossible, it is much larger than existing \nindications of solar variability. Given available \nscientific evidence, it would be foolish to base \ngreenhouse policy on the hope that solar variability \nwill somehow counter greenhouse warming. \n5. CLIMATE SIMULATION \nWe carried out one new climate simulation for \nthis conference. This calculation focused on the past \ndecade and the next few years, for the purpose of \nI Greenhouse \u20ac3 Volcano Forcings \nFig. 10. Greenhouse and stratospheric aerosol climate forcings in \nthe past century. Aerosol optical depth is based mainly on atmo- \nspheric transmission measurements a t  astronomical observatories \nand lunar eclipses. Zero point of aerosol forcing is the 1850-1989 \nmean. \nexamining the climate implications of recent \ninformation on changes of solar irradiance and other \nclimate forcings during the 1980s. The new calcula- \ntion builds on a base of earlier calculations \n(J. Geophys. Res. 93, 9341, 1988) and uses the same \nclimate model. The previous simulations used a \nrange of scenarios for greenhouse gas changes (A, B \nand C) and a rough estimate of stratospheric aerosol \noptical depth following El Chichon, which erupted \nless than a year before the simulation was started. \nGreenhouse gases and stratospheric aerosols were the \nonly changing climate forcings in the earlier \nsimulations. \nThe greenhouse gas forcing in the new \nsimulation, labeled B,, is based on our recent \ncalculation (J. Geophys. Res. 94, 16417, 1989) of the \ncombined forcing by C02, CFCs, CH, and N20, and \nis almost identical to scenario B of the previous \nstudy. Both B and Bn assume linear growth of \ngreenhouse forcing in the future, as opposed to the \nexponential growth of scenario A (\"business as \nusualn) and the eventual no-growth of scenario C \n(\"draconian emission cutsn). Scenarios B and Bn \nappear to be more realistic than scenarios A and C \nfor recent and near future changes of greenhouse \ngases. \nThe solar irradiance was constant in scenario B, \ni.e., there was no solar forcing. In scenario Bn we \nused an analytic approximation for satellite \nmeasurements of solar irradiance as suggested to us \nby Dick Willson: a cosine function with full \namplitude 0.1%, period 10.95 years, and maximum at \n1980.82. Good data through the present solar \nmaximum may allow an improved representation, but \nthis approximation should be sufficient for our \npresent purposes. \nThe stratospheric aerosols in scenario B are \ndescribed in our 1988 paper. Scenario Bn uses \naerosol opacities derived from approximately annual \nlunar eclipse data of Richard Keen (Sciertce. 222, \n1011, 1983 and private communication). The B, \naerosols have a larger maximum optical depth (0.12) \nthan the B aerosols and do not decrease quite as \nrapidly, so the Bn aerosols tend to give somewhat \nmore cooling in the middle 1980s. For aerosols, we \nare not certain whether B or Bn is more accurate. \nPresently we are working with Jim Pollack and Pat \nMcCormick to use a number of data sources to try to \ndefine the aerosol forcing more precisely. The net \nimpact of the changes of climate forcing in B,, as \ncompared to B, is a slightly increased forcing around \n1980, a decrease in the middle 1980s, and an increase \n-0.3 , v v v \n1960 1970 l G 0  1990 2000 \nDate \nAnnual Mean Global Temperature Change \nSCENARIO - \nFig. 11. Global temperatures for three new runs (B,) of model I1 compared to previously published scenario B. \nat the end of the 1980s and early 1990s. \nOne point we want to stress is the \"butterfly \neffect.\" If a climate model simulation is repeated, \nwith identical climate forcing but with some initial \natmospheric parameter (temperature, wind, etc.) \nchanged ever so slightly (a flap of a butterfly's wings \nin Buenos Aires), the simulations follow different \nchaotic paths. Thus we must make several runs of \nthe model, if we wish to draw any conclusions about \nclimate change on time scales of several years. \nWe illustrate the global temperature for three \nnew runs of the model (B,, B1 and B,) in Figure 11, \nalong with the published run, scenario B. The B1 \nand B2 runs begin on January 1, 1958 with the same \ninitial conditions as run B except for a slight noise \nadded to atmospheric temperatures. Since the \nforcings for B and B, are almost identical for the \nperiod 1958-1978, the results for B, B, and B, in \nthat 20 year period give an indication of the range \nof chaotic behavior of the model. Run Bo starts in \n1978 and uses B, climate forcing (its initial state is \nidentical to run B on January 1, 1978). \nNote that all the simulations show some response \n(cooling) to the large short-term negative climate \nforcings caused by the large volcanoes in 1963 \n(Agung) and 1982 (El Chichon). Of course the \nmodel does not contain the variability associated \nwith fluctuations in ocean heat transports, such as El \nNiios. Thus, although the real world (Fig. 3) shows \nclear evidence of cooling after Agung, apparent \ncooling in the 1982-1985 time frame is interrupted \nby an intense El ~ i n o  warming in 1983. \nThe dominant feature of the new simulations \n(runs Bo, B1 and Bf) is the very strong warming in \nthe late 1980s to a level in the early 1990s clearly \nabove any earlier global temperature. The \nmagnitude of the warming exceeds the noise level of \nthe model. The principal change in scenarios B,, as \ncompared to B, is a pushing back of the warming by \nabout 2 years to the end of the 1980s. However, \nboth B and B, reach very high global temperatures, \nabout 0.4C above the level of the 1950s, in the early \n1990s. \nWhat assumptions does this result depend upon? \nFirst, model sensitivity: our model has a sensitivity \n4C for doubled CO,. Any sensitivity in the range 2 \nto 5C is consistent with empirical data, such as that \nprovided by paleoclimate studies. A sensitivity \ntoward the lower end of this range would reduce the \npredicted warming, but not by so much as the ratio \nof sensitivities. Calculations should be carried out \nwith a lower sensitivity, but we do not expect the \nqualitative prediction to change. Secorrd, neglect of \nother unknown forcings: there are a number of \npoorly known forcings, such as anthropogenic \ntropospheric aerosols, sulfate alterations of cloud \nproperties, and aircraft contrails, for example. But \nthe evidence, as we have discussed, suggests that the \nanthropogenic greenhouse is the dominant forcing. \nA large volcano could change this picture, but their \nfrequency, several per century, makes an occurrence \nunlikely in the next year or two. Third, neglect of \nunforced natural cooling. Actually our \"butterflyn \nrange of experiments accounts for much unforced \nvariability. The El Ni io  cycle is probably the main \nunaccounted unforced variability, and the Earth has \njust come through the cool (La ~ i i a )  phase of that \ncycle, so, if anything, the El ~ i i o  is likely to add to \nwarming in the next 1-3 years. The possibility of a \nsudden \"flipn of ocean circulation, as discussed by \nBroecker, seems slim on the time frame of the next \n1-3 years, and there is little reason to believe such an \noccurrence would lower global mean temperature. \n6. DISCUSSION \nMy conclusion is that we are likely to set a \nmodern global temperature record in the next 1-3 \nyears, measurably exceeding the already high levels \nof the 1980s. I described this, in the introduction, as \na remarkable conclusion because it is even more \nimmediate and specific than our previous conclusion \nthat the 1990s would see a record temperature level. \nAnd other scientists, although most are in agreement \nthat the greenhouse effect will eventually cause \nglobal warming, have been unwilling to conclude \neven that we should expect record warmth in the \n1990s. This reluctance is usually based on the \nobservation that natural fluctuations are large in \ndecadal periods, and the fluctuations are toward \ncooling as often as toward warming. What is \noverlooked, I believe, is the fact that the present \nclimate is out of equilibrium with current \natmospheric composition. Because of that, it is \ndifficult for global temperature to maintain a large \n\"fluctuationn in the direction of lower temperature. \nIndeed, that point is illustrated by our \"butterflyn \nexperiments. And even if we insert a volcano of El \nChichon magnitude in 1995, as we did in our 1988 \npaper, the 1990s are warmer than the 1980s in the \nmodel. \nAre there political and social implications to be \ndrawn from this conclusion, without stretching it too \nfar? The results suggest that a candidate for election \nin 1992 may be making a serious mistake if he argues \nthat this is a time only for research and not to take \naction to slow emissions - because there is a very \ngood chance that he would get burned before the \n1992 election, burned by empirical evidence of a \nwarming world. To be burned badly would require \nsome large regional climate impacts as well, but the \nchance of that happening will rise with increasing \nglobal temperature. A social implication follows \nfrom the observation that serous attempts to control \ngreenhouse gas emissions will be strongly resisted, \nand thus hypothetical climate change next century is \nunlikely to spur much action. So clear-cut global \nwarming in the next 1-3 years could provide a push \nneeded to help move us toward the changes which \nwill be required to bring down greenhouse gas \nemissions. \nThat brings me to my friendly wager. The \nconclusion about expected near term warming is \nbased on simulations with a global climate model - \nthe tool which has been thoroughly condemned as \nbeing unreliable - condemned by many scientists as \nwell as bureaucrats. Also the statement I have made, \nthat the world is getting warmer and that it is \nprobably due to the greenhouse effect, has been \nwidely criticized as being unjustified. If those \ncriticisms are really believed, then surely someone \nwould be willing to accept the following wager: \nI claim that at least one year in the period \n1990-1992 will be warmer than any year in the prev- \nious century. I win only if it is true in all of the \nmain long term data sets: the GISS analysis of mete- \norological stations, the East Anglia analysis including \nships, and Angell's upper air (radiosonde) data set. \nI get three years and you get 100 years. Someone \nmentioned that there will probably be an El Niho in \nthe period 1990-1992. That may be so, but there \nwere probably 20 or 30 El ~ i h o s  in the previous \ncentury, including two very intense El Nihos in the \n1980s, which was the warmest decade. So there \nshould be plenty of souls willing to make this wager. \nThe offer remains open, so please contact me. \nCan we Iearn anything about long term climate \nfrom temperature and other data for just the next \nthree years? I think we can. If nature cooperates by \nholding off any large volcanoes, and if there is \nsignificant global warming consistent with the model \ncalculations, it will improve our confidence in our \nunderstanding of the climate system's response to a \nsustained global forcing. On the other hand, if there \nis no warming or a cooling, it will suggest that we \nhave overestimated climate sensitivity, overlooked \nother important climate forcings, or underestimated \nfluctuations in ocean transports. \nENDNOTES \n1,  Wottderland Model \nThe climate model used for the several hundred \nyear simulation (Fig. 5) is a modification of the GISS \nmodel 11. The physics is the same as in model 11, \nexcept that the fundamental equations include a \nmore accurate representation of the impact of water \nvapor on surface pressure and atmospheric thermo- \ndynamic properties, for the purpose of allowing \nsimulations over a greater range of climate states. \nThe primary difference compared to model I1 is the \ngeography (Fig. 12), which, borrowing from an idea \nof Suki Manabe, covers only 120 degrees of longi- \ntude in the wonderland model, with cyclic repetition \nto fill out spherical geometry. The amount of land as \na function of latitude is the same as in the real \nworld, and the zonal mean climate simulated by the \nwonderland model is almost the same as for model 11. \n9 0  I I I I I I I I I I I  \nNorth Polor Oceon \n82 \n5 1 \n4 3  \n35 \n2 7  \n- \n2 0  \nLn - \n12 z \n- v West Tropical \n-4 lsles Ocean \n- - \nDesertio n \n- \nNorthern \nOceon - \n- \nTropicano \nSouth Polor Oceon 1 \n-82 \n- Frieslond (pron. f reezelond) \n- 9 0 , \"  I '  I '  I I  \n2 3 4 5  6 7 8  9 1 0 1 1 1 2  \nLongitude \nFig. 12.

Ratioizale for a wager \nIt has been pointed out to me that proposing a \nwager, especially since it was reported in a scientific \njournal (Scierrce May 4, 1990), appears to be a bit \nunprofessional. On the other hand, it can be argued \nthat it is worthwhile to draw attention to the issue of \nwhether climate change during just the next few years \nhas implications for longer term climate change. \nHowever, the original rationale for the wager had \na slightly different purpose. I concocted the \nproposed bet before the AGU meeting last \nDecember, under the impression that I would be in \na panel discussion with Dick Lindzen. He has left \nthe impression with the public that he disagrees with \nmy assertion that the world is getting warmer and \nthat the warming is probably due to the greenhouse \neffect; also, he argues that climate sensitivity is much \nless than indicated by the models and that the \nanthropogenic greenhouse warming may be small \ncompared to natural variability. It seemed to me that \ngiven his position, he had to either accept the bet or \ndo a fancy shindig which would undermine the \nextreme view credited to him. As it turned out, \nthere was no panel discussion following our talks, so \nI had to save the proposition for the next conference. \nI had hoped that Bob Jastrow would bite on it, but \nhe demurred on the grounds that the sun is \nincreasingly warming the earth! That is interesting, \nsince he has long argued that the Earth is already \nheading into an ice age. Also, the satellite data do \nnot indicate a greater irradiance this solar cycle than \nin the previous one. \nWagers aside, it is interesting to look at data for \nthe first few months of 1990. Preliminary numbers \nfrom our (Hansen and Lebedeff) analysis of surface \nair reports from meteorological stations show \nanomalies (relative to 1951- 1980) of t0.5, t0.4, t1.5, \n+0.9C for the Northern Hemisphere and +0.1, -0.2, \nt0.2, +0.2C for the Southern Hemisphere for the first \nfour months of 1990. The March anomaly is the \nlargest for any month in our record, and, if the mean \nfor the first four months held for the next eight \nmonths, 1990 would be the warmest year in our \nrecord. However, the largest anomalies almost \nalways occur in Northern Hemisphere winter and \nearly spring, and throughout the warm decade of the \n1980s the first half of the year was considerably \nwarmer than the second half. Thus, for 1990 to rank \nas the warmest year will require that the remaining \nmonths be substantially warmer than they were in \nthe 1980s. \nAcknowledgements. We thank Richard Keen, H.

More than 32 forty modelling centres worldwide undertake climate model development1\u20133 and have rapidly 33 elevated their level of sophistication. Nowadays, many models simulate not only fundamental 34 physical laws of fluid motion, energy and momentum conservation but also include interactive carbon 35 cycle, aerosol and atmospheric chemistry schemes, or resolve the entire stratosphere4\u201310. However, 36 while all climate models are based on the same physical principles, there are development-specific 37 choices that lead to significant model differences, in particular related to subgrid-scale 38 parameterizations of clouds, convection and aerosols11\u201313. These contribute to persistent 39 discrepancies between models and observations as well as among model projections, for example 40 regarding precipitation changes1,14,15. Multi-model evaluation and intercomparison is often based on 41 the mean and variance of aggregate quantities such as temperature, or spectral properties and 42 (auto-)correlation measures16\u201318. One issue with such metrics is that models can be right for the 43 wrong reasons due to offsetting biases11,12,16. 44  Here we introduce causal model evaluation (CME) as a type of process-oriented model 45 evaluation11,18\u201320. CME deploys recently developed causal discovery methods21\u201323 adapted for 46 applications to climate data23\u201327. Within the CME framework, we evaluate the ability of models from 47 the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) to simulate atmospheric dynamical 48 interactions  classically measured as lagged correlations between climate variables at remote 49 locations28\u201331. Causal discovery algorithms go beyond correlation-based measures by systematically 50 excluding common driver effects and indirect links22,26,32,33. We show that characteristic causal 51 fingerprints can be learned from climate datasets, which are robust among ensemble members of 52 the same model and, for example, can identify shared model development backgrounds. Fingerprints 53 closer to observations are also associated with smaller precipitation biases in climate models. 54 Finally, we highlight the potential of our approach to offer a pathway to reducing uncertainties in 55 climate change projections, as well as to understand differences between models and observations.  56 3  Results 57 Causal model evaluation framework. To characterize the network of global dynamical interactions, 58 we use a causal discovery algorithm to reconstruct directed, time-lagged interdependency networks 59 from global climate datasets. Figure 1 provides an overview of the individual steps of the CME 60 framework (see Methods for details). 61  The selection of components defining the network nodes will typically be guided by expert 62 knowledge in conjunction with dimension reduction techniques. Here we use components obtained 63 through Varimax-rotated principal component analysis34,35 (PCA) applied to sea level pressure 64 anomaly data (Figure 1a; Methods). For sea level pressure data, PCA-Varimax components can be 65 interpreted as major modes of climate variability25,28,36,37. Due to the seasonal character of interaction 66 pathways28,38, we construct individual components, and in the next step networks, for the four 67 meteorological seasons: December, January, February (DJF); March, April, May (MAM); June, July, 68 August (JJA); September, October, November (SON). We select fifty components for each season 69 (Methods) whose geographic locations for DJF are indicated in Figure 1b (for all seasons see 70 Supplementary Fig. 1). PCA-Varimax can identify the major modes of variability37, for example 71 related to the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in the East, West and Central Pacific39 72 (components 1,4,5 in Figure 1b). 73  We calculate interactions among these nodes as causal networks from the associated 74 component time series (Figure 1b). For this step, we use the PCMCI algorithm by Runge et al.23,26, 75 which is particularly suited for high-dimensional and auto-correlated climate data (Methods). In 76 contrast to pure correlation measures, causal discovery methods are built to remove spurious links 77 due to common drivers and indirect pathways from the networks (Figure 1c)22,26. The resulting 78 networks contain information on the direction and associated time lags of potential causal links, 79 characterizing the pathways of the global interaction network. PCMCI has been tested extensively 80 to successfully recover important interactions in the climate system such as the tropical Walker 81 circulation and predictors of polar vortex states23,24,26,27. Note that, in these network structures, some 82 established interactions measured traditionally as direct correlations between climate modes can 83 follow a more complex pathway of indirect links. We illustrate this for the coupling between ENSO 84 and the Pacific-South American (PSA) pattern29,40 in Supplementary Figure 2. 85 4  86 Fig. 1 | Sketch of the causal model evaluation framework. a, Gridded Earth system data, here daily-mean sea level pressure from the 87 NCAR-NCEP reanalysis (approximating observations)41, is dimension-reduced using PCA-Varimax to b, a set of regionally confined 88 climate modes of variability. The same transformation is subsequently applied to climate model data (Methods). Core component regions 89 (in this case for the season December-January-February) are indicated in red. Each component is associated with a time series and 90 serves as one of the network nodes. Here, the component time series are afterwards 3-day-averaged. c, PCMCI estimates directed lagged 91 links among these nodes giving rise to d, dataset-characteristic causal fingerprints, which can be used for model evaluation and 92 intercomparison. Node colours in d indicate the level of autocorrelation (auto-MCI) as the self-links of each component and link colours 93 the interdependency strength (cross-MCI). Link-associated time lags (unit=3 days) are indicated by small labels. Only the around two 94 hundred most significant links for the reanalysis and for data from four 2climate models are shown. Links with lag zero, for which directions 95 cannot be easily causally resolved, are not shown. 96 5   The resulting causal networks effectively represent characteristic causal fingerprints42,43 for 97 each sea level pressure dataset (Figure 1d), which can be compared using network metrics25. Each 98 network consists of hundreds of links. Generally, we conduct pair-wise comparisons of all possible 99 links in a network A to a network B, taking A as the reference network. For example, we test if a link 100 from component 4 (West Pacific ENSO) to component 1 (East Pacific ENSO) found in observations 101 is also detected in climate model datasets. We use a modified asymmetric F1-score (Methods) as 102 the harmonic mean of precision (fraction of links in B that also occur in A) and recall (fraction of links 103 in A that are detected in B). F1-scores vary between 0 and 1 (perfect network match). The network 104 comparison results depend on the number of links considered to be statistically significant (Methods). 105 However, we tested that all conclusions based on the 400-500 most significant links per network 106 included here are robust to a large range of possible network link densities from a hundred to more 107 than a thousand links (Supplementary Figs. 3-6; Supplementary Table 1). 108 Application to pre-industrial simulations. Pre-industrial simulations are well suited for the CME 109 of atmospheric dynamical interactions due to the many years simulated by each model in the 110 absence of transient effects caused by anthropogenic forcings1\u20133. Specifically, we applied the CME 111 framework to 210 years of global DJF sea level pressure data from each of in total twenty CMIP5 112 models at a 3-day time resolution (Methods; Figure 2). In our algorithm settings, we include 113 interactions on a time-scale of up to 30 days (\u03c4max=10; Methods). We split each 210-year dataset into 114 three 70-year intervals (ensemble members) to study multi-decadal variations44,45. As a result, we 115 obtain nine possible network comparisons for each pair of models and six distinct comparisons 116 between ensemble members of the same model. F1-scores for these model intercomparisons are 117 shown in Figure 2. Three major features highlight the skill of the CME framework. 118  Firstly, each model can be recognized individually purely based on its causal fingerprint. 119 Networks estimated from different ensemble members of the same model are more consistent than 120 networks estimated from two different models as evident from the high F1-scores on the diagonal of 121 the matrix in Figure 2a (dark red). Each row in Figure 2a denotes the model used as the reference 122 against which each column is compared. 123  Secondly, models with shared development background can be detected. Many climate 124 models share software, resulting in important interdependencies among them12,46\u201350. CME can detect 125 6  such shared backgrounds (highlighted by black squares in Figure 2a). For example, CME identifies 126 the models HadGEM2-ES, HadGEM2-CC, ACCESS1-0 and ACCESS1-3 as similar, which are all 127 versions of the HadGEM model family51,52 developed by the UK Met Office. There is a clear 128 separation between these four and the remaining models, see Figure 2b showing all scores when 129 HadGEM2-ES networks are taken as the reference. The different models developed by the Institute 130 Pierre Simon Laplace (IPSL), the Max-Planck Society (MPI) and the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics 131 Laboratory (GFDL) are also each recognized as subgroups (Figures 2c-e). For the Japanese MIROC 132 models, two out of three are detected as a subgroup (MIROC-ESM, MIROC-ESM-CHEM), whereas 133 MIROC5 is even less similar than the multi-model average (gray line in Figure 2f). We conclude that 134 CME can detect similar models, a condition often but, as shown here, not always synonymous with 135 models developed under the same research umbrella. This demonstrates the significant potential of 136 using CME to assess model interdependencies based on causal networks. 137  Thirdly, climate models are recognized to share a physical ground truth. We further compared 138 all twenty models with two artificial reference cases: Random and Independent (last two 139 rows/columns in Figure 2a; Methods). For Random, we created fifty randomly coupled and auto-140 correlated noise time series, i.e. there are links in the system, but these do not follow any Earth 141 system physics. As evident from Figure 2a, the corresponding networks are self-consistent (diagonal 142 entry) but achieve very low F1-scores when compared to the actual climate models. For Independent, 143 we created auto-correlated time series without any significant coupling among them so that any 144 detected links occur randomly in the system (false positives). CME expectedly finds low scores 145 throughout for this case. 146 Causal model evaluation of historical simulations. Motivated by CME's skill to recognize models 147 with shared development background, we next evaluate the CMIP5 models with NCAR-NCEP 148 reanalysis data41 as a proxy for recent observations. We calculate fingerprints from twenty CMIP5 149 simulations covering approximately the historical period from 1st January 1948 to 31st December 150 2017 (Methods). For better statistical estimates, we only included models for which at least three 151 ensemble members were available (Supplementary Table 2). To additionally investigate the role of 152 seasonal variability, we carried out separate analyses for DJF, MAM, JJA and SON. However, all  153 7  154 Fig. 2 | Pre-industrial network intercomparison scores. a, Matrix of average F1-scores for pair-wise network comparisons between 155 ensemble members of twenty climate models (labelled following CMIP5 nomenclature in capital letters) using data for December-January-156 February (DJF) and two surrogate models (Random, Independent).

Black crosses (red for 160 the reference) mark average results also shown in a. Gray dashed lines mark the average score excluding the reference itself. Our causal 161 model evaluation approach detects the expected similarities between certain model groups as shown in b-f, which are additionally 162 indicated by inset black squares in a. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. 163 8  seasons yielded very similar results (Supplementary Figs. 3-6) and we focus the discussion on 164 annual F1-scores averaged over all seasons (Methods). 165  We find effectively the same model subgroups as before (inset boxes in Figure 3a). Due to 166 the slightly different setup, there is an additional subgroup related to the climate model CCSM4 167 (Supplementary Fig.  7). Taking the NCAR-NCEP reanalysis network as the reference, we obtain an 168 estimate of how well individual models capture the observed causal fingerprint (Figure 3b; the 169 models are ordered by average F1-score). The result is a continuum rather than a clear-cut 170 differentiation between a better and a worse group of models. However, models do exhibit 171 significantly different causal fingerprints (p-value53 < 10-9). We conducted the same analysis using a 172 shorter ERA-Interim reanalysis dataset54 to estimate the reference network and obtained almost the 173 same model order (Supplementary Fig. 8, Supplementary Table 1). 174 175 Fig. 3 | Historical network comparisons. a, As Figure 2a, but for climate model simulations spanning approximately the historical period 176 from 1st January 1948 to 31st December 2017 for which twenty CMIP5 models with up to ten different ensemble members are available. 177 b, Ordered F1-scores when the causal fingerprint learned from NCAR-NCEP reanalysis data is taken as the reference.

The model key for b is provided in Supplementary Table 1. We note that similar model rankings have been found regionally 180 for precipitation, e.g. for China55. Individual network scores (marker colours) in b follow the colour code from a. Source data are provided 181 as a Source Data file. 182 Implications for precipitation modelling. Atmospheric dynamical interactions as imprinted here 183 on the sea level pressure field are well-known drivers of precipitation anomalies in many world 184 regions28,29. Therefore, we test for relationships between the reanalysis-referenced F1-scores of 185 CME and Taylor S-scores55,56 for precipitation rates, which measure grid-cell-wise errors in 186 conjunction with overall discrepancies in precipitation variability across a spatial domain. To calculate 187 the S-scores, which also range from 0 to 1, we use historical Climatic Research Unit (CRU)57 land 188 9  surface precipitation data from the University of East Anglia, averaged over the years 1948-2017 189 (Methods). 190  We find that better fingerprints are associated with smaller land precipitation biases (F1- and 191 S-scores are positively correlated; Figure 4a). This is true globally (correlation coefficient R=0.7) as 192 well as in many world regions known to be influenced by (remote) dynamical interactions, in 193 particular North America (R=0.7), East Asia (R=0.6), Africa (R=0.5) and South Asia (R=0.5). These 194 results also hold if we disregard models belonging to the same subgroups as marked in Figure 3a. 195 There are some regional exceptions (e.g. Australia, Indonesia) where we find no significant 196 correlations. A possible explanation is predominant regional factors17,39 rendering a global network 197 metric less suitable. In addition, regional correlations are sometimes dependent on the number of 198 links included in the networks. For example, we find generally higher (lower) correlations for 199 Europe/North America (Africa) if weaker links are included (excluded), likely because tropical 200 connections have on average stronger dependencies (Supplementary Figs. 9-13).  201  An interesting question is how to interpret the relationship between precipitation and the 202 causal network skill scores from a physical point of view. Notably, the causal networks are, especially 203 at stringent significance thresholds, dominated by interactions on a timescale of less than one week 204 (lag \u03c4\u22642; Figure 1d). This timescale is broadly equivalent to dynamical interactions related to storm 205 tracks58. Simple metrics have been used before to quantify the skill of climate models to capture 206 storm tracks, e.g. pattern correlations in standard deviations of 2-6-days bandpass-filtered daily 207 mean sea level pressure data59. Indeed, Taylor S-scores for precipitation are also positively 208 correlated with such simpler metrics (Supplementary Figs. 18-20), which altogether indicates that a 209 large part of the links in the causal networks represent dynamical interactions related to storm tracks. 210 This result is in agreement with earlier work by Ebert-Uphoff and Deng32,33 who constructed networks 211 from DJF and JJA NCEP-NCAR reanalysis geopotential height data, as well as from equivalent data 212 from a single climate model. In their network analyses, they also found storm tracks to be a key 213 driver of network connectivity (see Methods for a comparison of our network methodologies).  214  Having highlighted the importance of storm tracks, we also point out that the simpler pattern 215 correlation storm track metrics generally show smaller and less significant correlations with the 216 precipitation S-scores on a global as well as on regional scales than our F1-network scores. This 217 10  underlines that our causal networks identify additional relationships which further improve the 218 correlations with precipitation. Longer time-scale dynamical interactions, for example triggered by 219 the ENSO and its zonal couplings as well as its effects on the extratropics are prime candidates for 220 explaining some of the higher skill related to our causal network scores. 221  Finally, we find strong indications that our causal metrics could aid in constraining uncertainty 222 in precipitation projections under climate change. As mentioned above, past model skill in a quantity 223 does not automatically imply skill for future projections as models can be right for the wrong reasons. 224 The networks we use here infer rather complex dynamical coupling relationships from sea level 225 pressure data that are effectively impossible to calibrate against current observations, different from, 226 for example, quantities such as global surface temperature11. Causal discovery methods could thus 227 provide more robust insights by identifying dynamical coupling mechanisms arising from underlying 228 physical processes that are more likely to hold also under future climate change scenarios (see 229 Discussion). It is therefore interesting to consider our complex causal information quantity in terms 230 of constraining future precipitation projections. Indeed, we find no relationship between the past 231 global precipitation skill S-scores and future precipitation rate changes in the CMIP5 projections, but 232 there appears to be an approximately parabolic relationship between projected CMIP5 global land 233 precipitation rate changes attained by the period 2050-2100 (relative to 1860-1910; Supplementary 234 Fig. 16) and F1-scores from historical runs (Figures 4b/c). This implies intermediate model range 235 land precipitation changes of around 0.0-0.1 mm/day according to the causal fingerprint scores, as 236 opposed to the most extreme negative and positive changes. We also note that simpler dynamical 237 metrics, e.g. based on sea level pressure Taylor S-Scores, or the aforementioned storm track skill 238 scores, and using the same non-parametric Gaussian Process regression (Figure 4b/c; Methods), 239 do also not yield such emergent relationships (Figure 4b/c, Supplementary Figs. 17-20). 240  Any method resting on the assumption that past model skill in a certain metric can be related 241 to projected future changes necessarily suffers from certain restrictions. Firstly, there could be 242 processes that are not at all (or not well) represented in climate models today, which might become 243 important in the future. However, this is true for any emergent relationship based on model evaluation 244 against past observations. Secondly, not all relevant processes might be well-captured through the 245 chosen metric. Our metric here is focused on dynamical processes (although it might, at least  246 11  Fig. 247 4 | Historical network scores and precipitation. a, Centre map: Climatic Research Unit (CRU) annual mean precipitation rate 248 climatology57 in mm day-1. Surrounding: linear correlations between the F1-scores for the CMIP5 models (with the NCAR-NCEP reanalysis 249 as the reference case) and regional precipitation bias scores (S-scores). Higher S-scores are equivalent to a better representation of 250 annual mean precipitation in a given model. Correlations are shown for six world regions and for the global land surface (exc luding 251 Antarctica), as labelled. Blue denotes data for all models; red the case where five models from causally similar sub-groups are excluded 252 (IPSL-CM5A-LR, ACCESS1-3, HadGEM2-CC, NorESM1-M, MPI-ESM-LR). b Relationship between F1-scores and land precipitation 253 changes projected by the CMIP5 models. The latter are calculated as the difference between the periods 1860-1910 and 2050-2100 under 254 the RCP8.5 scenario. The relationship exhibits an approximately parabolic structure, as evident from a Gaussian Process fit t o the data 255 (log-marginal likelihood: 44.15; Methods). Past model precipitation skill as measured through the global S-score does not provide a strong 256 relationship (c; log-marginal likelihood=26.35). This result is robust to the use of a different reanalysis, the number of links included in the 257 network, and can also be demonstrated to be statistically significant in a direct parabolic fit (Supplementary Figs. 14, 15). This implies that 258 precipitation rate changes (Supplementary Fig. 16) can be constrained using the F1-scores (best estimate is around 0.0-0.1 mm day-1), 259 whereas past model skill for the same variable does not provide such a constraint; in line with previous demonstrations that past model 260 biases in simple metrics are not necessarily indicative of future model projections12,62. Other simple dynamical metrics we tested generally 261 provided lower correlation scores with historical precipitation modelling skill and also did not provide the same emergent relationship for 262 future projections (Supplementary Figs. 17-19). Source data are provided as a Source Data file. 263 12  indirectly, capture the effects of some thermodynamical processes14,60), whereas, for example, future 264 changes in soil moisture are probably primarily thermodynamically driven. Future changes in soil 265 moisture, in turn, could regionally modulate future changes in land precipitation61.  Finally, the 266 possibilities for future projections are also constrained by the models participating in CMIP5. 267 Therefore, we can only constrain the relationship within the given data boundaries, and it should be 268 further verified across other scenarios and ensembles (such as CMIP6).  Similar model evaluation 269 exercises, also concerning variables other than precipitation and atmospheric dynamical 270 interactions, could test for similar emergent relationships in the ever-expanding data made available 271 through observations and climate modelling projects. Such studies might flexibly combine the 272 blueprint of the method outlined here with other dimension reduction techniques and/or causal 273 discovery algorithms32,33. 274 Discussion 275 We have highlighted causal model evaluation (CME) as a framework to evaluate state-of-the-art 276 climate models. Based on data-driven causal fingerprints, CME is able to detect models with shared 277 development backgrounds. By considering a large set of climate models simultaneously, we find that 278 climate models with more realistic dynamical causal fingerprints also have smaller precipitation 279 biases globally, and over highly populated areas such as North America, India and China. More 280 realistic fingerprints appear to also have implications for projected future changes in land surface 281 precipitation. Causal network analyses could therefore be a promising tool to constrain climate 282 change projections. The underlying premise is that physical processes (e.g., convection, cloud 283 formation, the large-scale circulation) lead to dynamical coupling mechanisms in Earth\u2019s 284 atmosphere. CME aims at statistically representing these couplings in the form causal networks, 285 which in turn are, as we show here, indicative of modelling skill in precipitation. It appears intuitive 286 that modelling skill as captured through our causal fingerprint scores is therefore also relevant for 287 modelling future changes in precipitation, at least so far as the physical processes relevant for 288 present-day precipitation remain important in future climates. 289  Our work builds on several previous causal network studies in climate science, which were 290 typically focused on network algorithm applications to individual climate modelling or reanalysis 291 datasets, or on the evaluation of dynamical interactions within individual climate models (e.g. refs. 292 13  27,32,33,63). Our results also add to work on global patterns of precipitation co-organization64, 293 suggesting atmospheric dynamical interactions as a key driver of important regional climate model 294 errors. We see great scope in using our framework to better understand differences between models 295 and observations, or among climate models, especially regarding causal interdependencies26. 296 Finally, we hope that our work will stimulate the use of novel model evaluation metrics. Causal 297 discovery algorithms have the potential to be at the forefront of this effort as they are able to detect 298 central features of Earth system dynamics such as the direction and time-lag associated with a global 299 teleconnection, opening the door for more in-depth causal interpretation studies26. CME could be 300 used to evaluate many other model systems, or could help tracking the impact of model development 301 over time. Ideally, CME will increasingly complement current evaluation approaches65 and tools66, 302 and will help constraining uncertainties in climate change projections67,68, also for climate variables 303 other than global land surface precipitation (Supplementary Fig. 21). The ever expanding use and 304 development of machine learning techniques in the scientific community63,69\u201372, as well as the 305 upcoming CMIP63, will greatly accelerate this movement. As such we consider our work as an 306 important stepping-stone for a range of machine learning and other data-driven methods aimed at 307 improving the state-of-the-art of climate modelling and complex system understanding. 308 Methods 309 F1 scores for network comparisons. The network comparisons are purely based on the existence 310 or non-existence of links in a network relative to a given reference network, assuming a certain 311 statistical significance threshold in the PCMCI method (\u03b1-level). The resulting true links are typically 312 only a small fraction (3-10%; depending on the \u03b1-level) of all possible lagged connections (N*(N-313 1)*\u03c4max=24,500) so that the binary (link vs. no link) network comparison becomes an imbalanced 314 classification problem. The F1-score is a widely used, however necessarily imperfect73, metric for 315 such problems. It balances the statistical precision (P) and recall (R). It is defined by  316 \ud835\udc391 =2\u2217\ud835\udc43\u2217\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc43+\ud835\udc45  (1) 317 With precision and recall defined by 318 \ud835\udc43 =\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc43+\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc43 (2) 319 \ud835\udc45 =\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc43+\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc41 (3) 320 Where FP (FN) is the number of falsely detected links (not detected links) relative to the reference 321 model and TP the number of true positive detected links. We further modified the definition of the F1-322 14  score slightly to account for the sign of dependence (positive or negative) and the networks' discrete 323 time-step nature and the expected natural variance in the precise timing of connections: assuming 324 a link exists in the reference network A, we tested if a matching link with the same sign of 325 dependence exists in network B (with the same causal direction) in a time interval of up to \u00b12 time 326 lags; equivalent to a time precision of about \u00b1 one week (six days). If a link was found at a time lag 327 not identical with the reference case, the sign of dependence was tested at the original time step. If 328 also found identical, the link was considered to exist in both networks. Due to this relaxation of the 329 time-lag constraint, pair-wise network comparison scores do depend on which network is considered 330 as the reference case. As a result, the scores for pair-wise network comparisons shown in Figures 331 2a and 3a are not symmetric (cross-diagonal entries are not identical) leading to a larger number of 332 possible comparisons. F1-scores can be calculated for each season, e.g. DJF as shown in Figure 2. 333 For the historical networks (Figure 3), an average F1-score was calculated from the individual scores 334 for each of the four seasons as 335 \ud835\udc391 =\ud835\udc391,DJF+\ud835\udc391,MAM+\ud835\udc391,JJA+\ud835\udc391,SON4 (4) 336 S scores for measuring precipitation modelling skill. First suggested by Taylor56, the S-score 337 measures how well a model captures the behaviour of a given climate variable (e.g. temperature, 338 precipitation) over a specific spatial domain relative to an observational dataset. It is defined by  339 \ud835\udc46 =(1+\ud835\udc45)44(\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc45+1\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc45)2 (5) 340 where R is the pattern correlation coefficient between the models and observations and SDR is the 341 ratio of spatial standard deviations between models and observations55,56. The calculation of R and 342 SDR incorporate grid cell area specific weighting with weights w 343 \ud835\udc45 =1\ud835\udc4a\u2211 \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc56(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56\u22121\ud835\udc4a\u2211 \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc57=1 )(\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56\u22121\ud835\udc4a\u2211 \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc57=1 )\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc56=1\ud835\udf0emodel\ud835\udf0eref (6) 344 where xi and yi are values for the same quantity (e.g. precipitation rate; mm day-1) in a given grid cell 345 i in the two datasets to be compared, n is the number of grid cells, and W is the sum of area weights 346 \ud835\udc4a = \u2211 \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc57=1  (7) 347 The spatially-weighted standard deviations \u03c3 (that is \u03c3model and \u03c3ref) and the final SDR term are 348 calculated through 349 \u03c32 = 1\ud835\udc4a\u2211 \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56 \u22121\ud835\udc4a\u2211 \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc57=1 )2\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc56=1 (8) 350 SDR =  \ud835\udf0emodel\ud835\udf0eref    (9) 351 The S-score thus considers both the pattern similarity over the spatial domain with regard to a given 352 quantity as well as their amplitude ratios, as both the spatial coherence and magnitude range of a 353 variable is important for measuring model skill56. 354 15  PCA Varimax. The dimension reduction step (Figure 1b) serves as a data-driven method to extract 355 large-scale patterns of regional sea level pressure variability that in many cases resemble well-356 known climatological processes such as the ENSO or the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). To extract 357 climatological processes, we here choose truncated principal component analysis, followed by a 358 Varimax rotation (PCA-Varimax)34,35. Principal components, often referred to as empirical orthogonal 359 functions (EOFs) in climate science and meteorology, are frequently used to identify orthogonal, 360 uncorrelated global modes of climate variability25,28,36,37. To remove noisy components, we then 361 truncate and keep only the first 100 leading components in terms of their explained variance. The 362 additional Varimax rotation on these leading components then maximizes the sum of the variances 363 of the squared weights so that the loading of weights at different grid locations will be either large or 364 very small. It has been shown that this leads to more physically consistent representations of actual 365 climate modes, mainly because the Varimax rotation allows spatial patterns associated with the 366 components to become more localised and their time series of weights to be correlated, as is the 367 case for actual physical modes25,36,37. Principal components without rotation consecutively maximize 368 variance and therefore often mix contributions of physically defined modes such ENSO, Pacific 369 Decadal Oscillation (PDO), or the NAO, whose time-behaviour is not orthogonal, making patterns 370 more difficult to interpret. We here estimated the spatial pattern (loading) of the Varimax components 371 from 70-year (1948-2017) daily sea level pressure anomalies of the NCAR-NCEP reanalysis 372 dataset41 and then used these weights to also consistently extract the Varimax component time 373 series from the CMIP5 sea level pressure simulations. The motivation behind using sea level 374 pressure as the variable underlying the networks is that it is a standard variable to characterize large-375 scale atmospheric dynamics and corresponding variability, e.g. in climate modes or weather 376 patterns. Therefore, it is also available in virtually any reanalysis dataset or model data archive, 377 which allowed us to work with the largest possible number of ensemble members for the CMIP5 378 analysis. The components obtained for the four meteorological seasons for the NCEP data can be 379 found in Supplementary Figs. 22-421. For the subsequent causal discovery method, we further 380 filtered weights in terms of their spatial separability and their frequency spectra, leading to a total of 381 fifty components for each season. For example, we typically excluded components that exhibited a 382 sudden change in behaviour when entering the satellite era (1979-), which resulted in unresolved 383 frequency spectra (e.g. DJF components 18, 36, 38, 41 provided as Supplementary Figs. 40, 58, 60, 384 and 63). Such apparently unphysical component time series changes were in particular found in 385 Asia, Africa and the Middle East and could therefore be related to a lack of historical data coverage 386 feeding into the reanalysis in those regions. To further control for the importance of choosing a 387 certain set of components for the overall results and conclusions, we sometimes included some of 388 these components for certain seasons (e.g. component 7 for DJF), but we did not find any noticeable 389 sensitivity of the relative F1-scores to this selection process. A side effect of this selection process, 390 however, remains a reduced network coverage in those areas. Overall, we found that the global 391 network metrics were effectively insensitive to the choice of nodes and their geographical 392 distribution. This is also evident from the relative insensitivity of the model rankings to the specific 393 16  season (Supplementary Figures 1, 3-6 and Supplementary Table 1). The indices of the fifty 394 components chosen for each season are provided at the beginning of each section in Supplementary 395 section 2. The component time series were averaged to 3-day-means before the application of 396 PCMCI. This time-aggregation presents a compromise to resolve short-term interactions in our 397 intercomparison (a few days), while limiting the increase in dimensionality due to additional time lags 398 (here 10 time lags for \u03c4max =30). 399 PCMCI causal discovery method. PCMCI is a time series causal discovery method further 400 described in ref. 23. Commonly, causal discovery for time series is conducted with Granger causality 401 which is based on fitting a multivariate autoregressive time series model of a variable Y on its own 402 past, the past of a potential driver X, and all the remaining variables\u2019 past (up to some maximum 403 time delay \u03c4max). Then X Granger-causes Y if any of the coefficients corresponding to different time 404 lags of X is non-zero (typically tested by an F-test). As analyzed in ref. 23, Granger causality, due to 405 a too high model complexity given finite sample size, has low detection power for causal links (true 406 positive rate) if too many variables are used and for strong autocorrelation, both of which are relevant 407 in our analysis. PCMCI avoids conditioning on all variables by an efficient condition-selection step 408 (PC) that iteratively performs conditional independence tests to identify the typically few relevant 409 necessary conditions. In a second step, this much smaller set of conditions is used in the momentary 410 conditional independence (MCI) test that alleviates the problem of strong autocorrelation. In general, 411 both the PC and MCI step can be implemented with linear or nonlinear conditional independence 412 tests. Here we focus on the linear case and utilize partial correlation (ParCorr). A causal 413 interpretation rests on a number of standard assumptions of causal discovery as discussed in ref. 414 22, such as the Causal Markov assumption, Faithfulness, and stationarity of the causal network over 415 the time sample considered. The free parameter of PCMCI is the maximum time delay \u03c4max, here 416 chosen to include atmospheric timescales over which we expect dependencies to be stationary. The 417 pruning hyper-parameter pc-\u03b1 in the PC condition-selection step is optimized using the Akaike 418 information criterion (among pc-\u03b1 = 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5). PCMCI yields a p-value (based on 419 a two-sided t-test) for every pair of components at different lags. We defined links in the networks 420 using a strict significance level of 10-4 in the main paper. However, very similar results are found for 421 other more relaxed or even stricter significance levels; as demonstrated extensively in the 422 Supplementary Material. 423 Other network construction methods. As discussed in the main text, causal networks have been 424 used several times before in the climate context. Two of the most prominent cases of such studies 425 are those described in refs. 32,33, where Ebert-Uphoff and Deng also discuss remote impacts and 426 information pathways as well as the role of storm tracks as important drivers of network connectivity. 427 Their work is further a good demonstration of other possible ways to construct causal networks, the 428 effect of which might be an interesting topic for future studies. For example, their network approach 429 was carried out on a grid-cell-wise level rather than using PCA Varimax components. The latter are 430 designed to capture distinct regional climatological processes while an analysis at the grid-cell level 431 17  is more granular which, however, carries the challenges of higher dimensionality, will have a strong 432 redundancy among neighbouring grid cells, and grid-level metrics will require handling varying 433 spatial resolution among datasets. Furthermore, the original PC causal discovery algorithm used in 434 their work is less suited for the time series case than PCMCI23. They also used another 435 meteorological variable (500 hPa geopotential height) to construct their networks and compared 436 aggregate network metrics rather than comparing networks on a link-by-link basis. 437 CMIP5 data. For the network constructions, we used daily mean sea level pressure data from the 438 CMIP5 data archive, as stored by the British Atmospheric Data Centre (BADC). An overview of all 439 models and simulations used is given in Supplementary Table 2. The twenty models used for the 440 pre-industrial networks are as labelled in Figure 2a. The twenty models used for the historical and 441 RCP8.5 reference case are as labelled in Figure 3a. Typically, we used the final 210 years of each 442 pre-industrial simulation, assuming that these years represent the most equilibrated state of each 443 model. For historical and RCP8.5 simulations, we used at least three ensemble members which 444 typically covered 70 years between 1st January 1936 and 31st December 2017. Relaxing the left time 445 boundary by up to twelve years relative to the reanalysis data time period allowed us to include more 446 models, as some modelling centres ran more historical than RCP8.5 simulations. If sufficient data 447 was available for both the historical and RCP8.5 simulation, the two simulations were merged on 1st 448 January 2006; the day after historical simulations ended in most cases. All data (including the 449 reanalysis datasets) was linearly de-trended on a grid cell basis and seasonally anomalized by 450 removing the long-term daily mean. Note that sea level pressure data is effectively stationary even 451 under historically forced climatic conditions so that the de-trending is a prudent step to remove any 452 potentially occurring small trends to a good approximate degree. Of course, we cannot fully account 453 for the very long time-scales that may be associated with some climate processes74 beyond the time-454 scale covered by each individual dataset. Each model dataset was bi-linearly interpolated to a 2.5\u00b0 455 latitude x 2.5\u00b0 longitude grid in order to extract the component time series based on the Varimax 456 loading weights computed from the NCAR-NCEP41 reanalysis data. 457 Precipitation data. As observational reference, we used the land surface CRU TS v4.03 dataset 458 from the University of East Anglia57, which does not cover Antarctica. CMIP5 precipitation data was 459 taken from single ensemble members (Supplementary Table 2) of the historical and RCP8.5 460 simulations, as described above. As for the sea level pressure data, all precipitation data was bi-461 linearly interpolated to the NCAR-NCEP spatial grid prior to the intercomparison. Climate change-462 induced differences shown in Figures 4b,c were calculated by subtracting the model-specific land 463 surface (using an ocean and Antarctica mask equivalent to the one of the CRU dataset) average 464 precipitation rate for the period 1860-1910 (covered by all models) from the same measure for the 465 years 2050-2100. 466 Random and Independent data. The datasets for the Random and Independent case in Figure 2a 467 were created with Gaussian noise driven multivariate autoregressive models of the same number of 468 variables as in the original data. For the Independent case only the lag-1 autocorrelation coefficients 469 18  are non-zero and set to a value of 0.7. Hence, all variables are independent, but due to finite sample 470 effects, the estimated networks with PCMCI will still contain some cross-links. For the Random case, 471 we created a random network with a link density of 5%, randomly connecting two components at 472 lag-1 with a coefficient of 0.1, in addition to autocorrelation coefficients with a value of 0.7 for each 473 component. Like for the original data, we simulated three datasets (covering 70-year periods of the 474 210 years) with the same sample size as the original data. 475 Gaussian Process regression. To estimate the nonlinear dependency between F1/S-scores and 476 land precipitation changes (Figures 4b,c and Supplementary Figure 14), we used Gaussian 477 Processes (GP) as a widely used Bayesian non-parametric regression approach75. We implemented 478 the GP with a standard radial basis function kernel with an added white noise kernel and optimized 479 the hyperparameters using the log-marginal likelihood. The resulting fit line is approximately 480 parabolic when using the F1-score. In Supplementary Figure 15 we also directly fit a parabolic 481 function y=a+bx+cx2. 482 Data availability. All raw sea level pressure, surface temperature and precipitation rate data is 483 publicly available. CMIP5 data is available through the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory 484 (https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/mips/cmip5/availability.html) and many other sources such as the British 485 Atmospheric Data Centre (BADC, http://www.badc.rl.ac.uk/) as variables 'psl', 'tas' and 'pr', see 486 Supplementary Table 2 for an overview of all selected simulations.

A climate transition in-\nvolves coupled changes of these systems following an initial perturbation, or \u201cforcing\u201d. The feedbacks\nmay be sufficiently strong that the net transition is substantially larger or smaller than from the forc-\ning alone. Nevertheless, it is important to identify the primary forcing agents since they provide the\nfundamental reason why the climate changed, whereas the feedbacks determine by how much.\nInternal forcing agents (those arising within Earth\u2019s climate system) include volcanoes, anthro-\npogenic greenhouse gases and, on very long time scales (tens of millions of years), plate tectonics.\nVolcanoes have a cooling effect due to increased absorption and reflection of incoming shortwave radi-\nation by aerosols ejected into the stratosphere. Greenhouse gas concentrations determine the absorption\nand emission of longwave radiation in the atmosphere with respect to altitude. Plate tectonics influence\nthe climate by changing the size, location and vertical profile of land masses, by modifying the air and\nocean circulations, and by exchanging CO2 in the atmosphere with carbonates in the lithosphere.\nAt present, and ignoring meteor impact, there are only two established external forcing agents:\norbitally-modulated solar insolation and variations of solar irradiance. Spectral analysis of the glacial\ncycles reveals precise frequencies that match Earth\u2019s orbital variations caused by the gravitational per-\nturbations of the other planets. In fact, the narrow spectral widths\u2014obtained on untuned data\u2014imply\nthat the glacial cycles are driven by an astronomical forcing agent, regardless of the detailed mechanism;\noscillations purely internal to Earth\u2019s climate system could not maintain such precise phase coherency\nover millions of years [1]. A linkage between orbit and climate is provided by the Milankovitch model,\nwhich states that retreats of the northern ice sheets are driven by peaks in northern hemisphere summer\ninsolation. This has become established as the standard model of the ice ages since it naturally includes\nspectral components at the orbital modulation frequencies. However, high precision palaeoclimatic data\nhave revealed serious discrepancies with the Milankovitch model that either fundamentally challenge its\nvalidity or, at the very least, call for a significant extension [1].\nVariations of solar irradiance by about 0.1% have been measured over the 11 y solar cycle, and are\nwell understood in terms of sunspot darkening and faculae brightening [2]. From the knowledge of stellar\nevolution and development, the slow progression of irradiance on extremely long time scales (of order\ntens of millions of years) is also well understood. However, no mechanism has been identified so far\nfor secular irradiance variations on time scales between these two limits. On the other hand, substantial\nmagnetic variability of the Sun on decadel, centennial and millennial time scales is well established from\nmagnetometer measurements over the last 150 y [3] and from archives of 14C in tree rings and 10Be\nin ice cores [4]. These light radioisotope archives record the galactic cosmic ray (GCR) flux in Earth\u2019s\natmosphere, which is modulated by the interplanetary magnetic field and its inhomogeneities carried by\nthe solar wind. In earlier studies, long-term solar magnetic variability was assumed to be a proxy for\nirradiance variability [5]. However this assumption lacks a physical basis, and more recent estimates\nsuggest that long-term irradiance changes are probably negligible [6, 7, 8].\nIt is well-established that Earth\u2019s climate varies substantially on centennial and millennial time\nscales [9]. Some of these variations may be due to \u201cunforced\u201d internal oscillations of the climate system,\ninvolving components with suitably long response times, such as the ice sheets. However, it is hard\nto explain away all these climate variations as internal oscillations\u2014especially in cases involving large\nclimate shifts (e.g. persistent suborbital variations of sea-level by 10\u201320 m have occurred during both\nglacial and interglacial climates [10]), or where synchronous climate changes are observed in widely-\nseparated geographical locations, without any clear path for their teleconnection. At present there is\nno established natural forcing agent on these time scales; they are either too short (solar irradiance,\nvolcanoes)1 or too long (solar insolation, plate tectonics). In recent years, however, numerous studies of\n1Greenhouse gases are not included since, prior to the twentieth century, short-term changes of greenhouse gases, such as\n1\ncentennial and millennial scale climate change have reported association with GCR variations. These are\nfrequently considered in the literature as a proxy for changes of solar irradiance (or a spectral component\nsuch as solar ultra violet [12]). The ambiguous interpretation as either a solar-climate or a GCR-climate\nforcing mechanism can in principle be resolved by examining climate change on different time scales\nsince, unlike solar irradiance, the GCR flux is also affected over longer times by geomagnetic and galactic\nvariations, and over shorter times by solar magnetic disturbances.\nThe complexity of the climate system means that it is not easy to explain correlations of solar\nvariability and climate in mechanistic models. On the other hand, the observations are too numerous and\nof too high quality to be ignored or dismissed. The key challenge is to establish a physical mechanism\nthat could link solar or cosmic ray variability with the climate. If a detailed physical mechanism of\nclimatic significance were to be established then the whole field of solar variability would rapidly be\ntransformed into a quantitative and respectable branch of climate science. But what could the cosmic\nray-climate mechanism be? Since the energy input of GCRs to the atmosphere is negligible\u2014about 10\u22129\nof the solar irradiance, or roughly the same as starlight\u2014a substantial amplification mechanism would\nbe required. An important clue may be the reported correlation of GCR flux and low cloud amount,\nmeasured by satellite [13, 14, 15]. Although the observations are both disputed [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]\nand supported [22, 23, 24], increased GCR flux appears to be associated with increased low cloud cover.\nSince low clouds are known to exert a strong net radiative cooling effect on Earth [25], this would\nprovide the necessary amplification mechanism\u2014and also the sign of the effect: increased GCRs should\nbe associated with cooler temperatures.\nStudying past climate variability, before any anthropogenic influence, is a good way to understand\nnatural contributions to present and future climate change. If there is good evidence for a significant influ-\nence of solar/GCR variability on past climate then it is important to understand the physical mechanism.\nDespite the lack of evidence for long-term variability of the total or spectral (ultra violet) irradiance, it\ncannot be ruled out and remains an important candidate. However since there is clear evidence for long-\nterm variability of cosmic rays, the possibility of a direct influence of cosmic rays on the climate should\nalso be seriously considered [26]. It is the purpose of this paper to review some of the palaeoclimatic\nevidence for GCR-climate forcing\u2014on progressively longer time scales\u2014and to consider the possible\nphysical mechanisms and climatic signatures. Finally, we will describe how these mechanisms will be\nstudied under controlled laboratory conditions with the CLOUD facility at CERN.\n2 SOLAR/COSMIC RAY-CLIMATE VARIABILITY\n2.1 Last millennium\n2.1.1 The Little Ice Age and Medieval Warm Period\nThe most well-known example of solar-climate variability is the period between 1645 and 1715 known\nas the Maunder Minimum [27], during which there was an almost complete absence of sunspots (Fig. 1).\nThis marked the most pronounced of several prolonged cold spells between about 1450 and 1850 which\nare collectively known as the Little Ice Age. During this period the River Thames in London regularly\nfroze across in winter, and fairs complete with swings, sideshows and food stalls were held on the ice.\nThe Little Ice Age was preceded by a mild climate known as the Medieval Warm period between about\n1000 and 1270. Temperatures during the Medieval Warm period were elevated above normal, allowing\nthe Vikings to colonise Greenland and wine to be made from grapes in England.\nA recent multi-proxy reconstruction of northern hemisphere temperatures [29] estimates that the\nLittle Ice Age was about 0.6\u25e6C below the 1961\u20131990 average, and that climate during the Medieval\nWarm period was comparable to the 1961\u20131990 average (Fig. 2a). This contrasts with a widely-quoted\nearlier reconstruction [31, 32], known as the hockey stick curve, which indicates a temperature decrease\noccurred during glacial-interglacial transitions, are found to be a feedback of the climate system and not a primary forcing agent\n[11].\n2\nFig. 1: Variation of the group sunspot number from 1610 to 1995 [28]. The record starts 3 years after the\ninvention of the telescope by Lippershey in Holland. The gradual increase of solar magnetic activity since the\nMaunder Minimum is readily apparent.\nFig. 2: Comparison of variations during the last millennium of a) temperature (with respect to the 1961\u20131990\naverage), b) galactic cosmic rays (note the inverted scale; high cosmic ray fluxes are associated with cold temper-\natures) and c) glacial advances in the Venezuelan tropical Andes near Lake Mucubaji (8\u25e647\u2032N, 70\u25e650\u2032W, 3570 m\naltitude) [30]. The temperature curves comprise a multi-proxy reconstruction of northern hemisphere temperatures\n(the band shows 95% confidence interval) [29], the so-called hockey-stick curve [31, 32], borehole temperature\nmeasurements worldwide [33] and from Greenland [34], and smoothed instrumental measurements since 1860.\nThe cosmic ray reconstructions are based on several 14C measurements in tree rings (data points and dashed green\ncurve) [35, 36], and 10Be concentrations in ice cores from the South Pole (solid blue curve) [37] and Greenland\n(solid red curve) [38]. The 14C anomalies are smaller than those of 10Be since they are damped by exchanges with\nthe CO2 reservoirs.\n3\nof only 0.2\u25e6C between 1000 and 1900, followed by a steep rise in the 20th century (Fig. 2a). However\nthe methodology of the hockey stick analysis has been questioned [39]. There have been numerous other\ntemperature reconstructions for the last millennium, which generally lie between these two limits, and\ntheir unweighted mean is often used as the combined best estimate [8]. However, this can be misleading\nsince many of the reconstructions share the same temperature proxy datasets, so they are not independent\nmeasurements. Perhaps the most accurate measurements of temperatures over the past millennium are\nprovided by geothermal data from boreholes, since these are direct measurements of past temperatures\nwith thermometers\u2014albeit with a modest time resolution that does not preserve rapid changes. The\nworldwide borehole measurements [33] indicate Little Ice Age temperatures about 0.6\u25e6C below those of\nthe mid-20th century, and the Greenland boreholes [34] indicate a pronounced Medieval Warm period\nand Little Ice Age; all favour the multi-proxy reconstruction [29] shown in Fig. 2a.\nFor comparison, the variation of GCR intensity over the last millennium is shown in Fig. 2b, as\nreconstructed from 14C in tree rings [36], and 10Be in ice cores from the South Pole [37] and Greenland\n[38]. Close similarities are evident between the temperature and GCR records, showing an association\nof high GCR flux with a cooler climate, and low GCR flux with a warmer climate. This pattern has been\nextended over the last two millennia by a reconstruction of Alpine temperatures with a speleothem from\nSpannagel Cave in Austria (Fig. 3) [40]. Temperature maxima in this region of central Europe during\nthe Medieval Warm Period were about 1.7\u25e6C higher than the minima in the Little Ice Age, and similar\nto present-day values. The high correlation of the temperature variations to the \u220614C record (Fig. 3)\nsuggests that solar/cosmic ray forcing was a major driver of climate over this period.\nFig. 3: Temperature reconstruction for the Central Alps over the last two millennia, obtained from the \u03b418O\ncomposition of a speleothem from Spannagel Cave, Austria [40]. The variations of cosmic rays (\u220614C) and CO2\nover this period are also indicated.\n2.1.2 Intertropical Convergence Zone\nAlthough the cultural records and temperature reconstructions of the Little Ice Age are predominantly\nfrom Europe and the northern hemisphere, numerous palaeoclimatic studies have confirmed the cooling\nto be a global phenomenon. One example which shows a clear GCR association is a reconstruction of\nglacial advances in the Venezuelan tropical Andes (Fig. 2c) [30]. The inferred glacial advances indicate\nthis region experienced a temperature decline of (3.2\u00b11.4)\u25e6C and a 20% increase of precipitation during\nthe Little Ice Age.\n4\nAnother example is a reconstruction of rainfall and drought in equatorial east Africa over the past\n1100 y, based on the lake-level and salinity fluctuations of Lake Naivasha, Kenya [41]. The data show\nthat the climate in this region was significantly drier than today during the Medieval Warm period, and\nthat the Little Ice Age was an extended wet period interrupted by three dry intervals that coincide with\nthe GCR oscillations seen in Fig. 2b. A similar association of GCRs and tropical rainfall during the\nLittle Ice Age has been observed in the region of the Gulf of Mexico [42]. Increased GCR flux seems\nto have paced increases in the salinity of the Florida Current, leading to a 10% reduction of the Gulf\nStream flow during the Little Ice Age. These examples suggest a possible solar/cosmic ray influence on\nthe Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). The ITCZ is a region of intense precipitation formed by the\nconvergence of warm, moist air from the north and south tropics by the convective action of the tropical\nHadley cells. The location of the ITCZ approximately follows the Sun\u2019s zenith path, moving north in the\nnorthern summer and south in the winter (Fig. 4). Numerous other palaeoclimatic reconstructions of the\nLittle Ice Age support the existence of a global influence of GCR flux on tropical rainfall and, moreover,\nprovide the rather clear picture that increased GCR flux is associated with a southerly displacement of\nthe ITCZ (Fig. 4) [43]. Since the deep convective ITCZ system is the major source of water vapour for\nthe upper troposphere in the tropics and sub-tropics, it controls the supply of the major greenhouse gas\n(water vapour accounts for about 90% of Earth\u2019s greenhouse effect [54]) and the availability of water\nvapour for cirrus clouds over a large region. The displacement of the ITCZ during the Little Ice Age may\ntherefore imply a substantial global climate forcing.\nFig. 4: Locations of palaeoclimatic reconstructions of the Little Ice Age indicating wetter (circles labeled W0\u2013\nW4) or drier (boxes labeled D6\u201313) conditions than present [43]. The approximate most northerly (July) and\nsoutherly (January) modern limits of the ITCZ are indicated by the wide transparent bands. The observations\nindicate a southerly shift of the ITCZ range during the Little Ice Age. The references are W0 [30], W1 [44], W2\n[41], W3 [45], W4 [43], D5 [46], D6 [47], D7 [42], D8 [48], D9 [49], D10 [50], D11 [51], D12 [52] and D13 [53].\n2.1.3 Solar and cosmic ray changes since the Little Ice Age\nThe cold climate of the Little Ice Age appears to have been caused by an extended period of low solar ac-\ntivity. Few sunspots implies low magnetic activity and a corresponding elevated GCR flux. But could the\nobserved warming since the Little Ice Age be explained by changes of solar irradiance rather than intro-\nducing the possibility of GCR-climate forcing? Recent results on Sun-like stars, combined with advances\nin the understanding of solar magnetohydrodynamics [8] have revised earlier estimates of the long-term\nvariation of solar irradiance [5] downwards by as much as a factor of five (Fig. 5) [6, 7]. Apart from the\nirradiance changes due to sunspot darkening and facula brightening, no mechanism has been identified\n5\nFig. 5: Top-of-atmosphere solar forcing since 1600 showing previous estimates (dashed curve) [5] and present\nestimates (solid curve) [6].\nFig. 6: Variations of the 10Be concentration in Greenland ice cores since 1700 (lower curve) [55] and of the solar\ninterplanetary magnetic field since 1870, derived from geomagnetic measurements (upper curve, note inverted\nscale) [3]. The 10Be concentration is directly proportional to the cosmic ray flux integrated over the troposphere\nand stratosphere. The 10Be data are unsmoothed, and their short-term fluctuations are dominated by solar cycle\nmodulation.\nfor solar luminosity variations on centennial or millennial time scales [8]. Current estimates of the sec-\nular increase of irradiance since 1700 are therefore based only on the variation in mean sunspot number.\nThe increase in irradiance amounts to less than 0.5 Wm\u22122, which corresponds to about 0.08 Wm\u22122 at\nthe top of the atmosphere, globally averaged (Fig. 5). Assuming a climate sensitivity of 0.7 K/Wm\u22122,\nthis would contribute less than 0.06\u25e6C of the estimated 0.6\u25e6C mean global warming between the Maun-\nder Minimum and the middle of last century, before significant anthropogenic contributions could be\ninvolved.\nOn the other hand, there is clear evidence of a substantial increase in solar magnetic activity since\nthe Little Ice Age (Fig. 6) [55, 3]. The 10Be record indicates that the mean global cosmic ray flux has\ndecreased by about 30% since the the Little Ice Age, with about one half of this decrease occurring\nin the last century. The good agreement found between the 10Be and 14C records confirms that their\nvariations reflect real changes of the cosmic ray flux and not climatic influences on the transport processes\ninto their respective archives [56]. Around two-thirds of the 10Be is produced in the stratosphere, and\none-third in the troposphere, so the ice cores archives are sensitive to relatively soft primary cosmic\n6\nFig. 7: Solar modulation of the galactic cosmic ray intensity for the period 1957\u20132001: a) balloon measurements\nof the cosmic ray intensity at shower maximum (15\u201320 km altitude), measured by the Lebedev Physical Institute\n[57, 58], and b) Wolf sunspot number. The curves correspond to four different locations for the balloon flights:\nMirny-Antarctica (0.03 GeV/c rigidity cutoff), Murmansk (0.6 GeV/c), Moscow (2.4 GeV/c) and Alma-Ata (6.7\nGeV/c). Due to atmospheric absorption, the data of Murmansk and Mirny practically coincide with each other.\nrays. The higher energy component that penetrates the troposphere has decreased by a smaller amount\nthan suggested by Fig. 6. During the twentieth century, the secular reduction of GCR intensity was\napproximately equivalent to the present-day solar-cycle modulation (Fig. 6), corresponding to about 10%\nin the troposphere. The decrease is due to an unexplained increase of the solar interplanetary magnetic\nfield by more than a factor of two over this period (Fig. 6) [3]. In view of the substantial variability of\ncosmic rays, if they are indeed found to influence cloud cover it could have considerable implications for\nunderstanding past climate change and predicting future variability.\nDuring the second half of the twentieth century, the variation of GCR flux has been directly mea-\nsured with particle counters. Although these instruments have a low threshold energy (few MeV) for\nparticle detection, the corresponding threshold energy of the primary cosmic rays depends on the type\nof detected secondary particle and the amount of atmospheric shielding. In the case of ground-based\ndetectors at sea level, the primary proton threshold energy is about 1.5 GeV for neutron monitors and\nabout 9 GeV for ionization chambers (which detect muons, electrons and protons) [57]. The most sensi-\ntive measurements are made by balloon-borne ionization chambers, which can reach 30\u201335 km altitude\n(4 g/cm2 atmospheric shielding); these have a primary proton threshold of about 0.1 GeV at the highest\naltitudes. The Lebedev Physical Institute has made continuous measurements of cosmic rays over the\nlast 50 years with balloon-borne detectors at several stations [57, 58]. The data for the period 1957\u2013\n2001 show the solar cycle modulation and the effect of geomagnetic shielding, which leads to reduced\nfluxes and modulation amplitudes at lower geomagnetic latitudes (Fig. 7). Although the GCR reduction\n7\noccurred mainly in the first half of the twentieth century (Fig. 6), the cosmic ray measurements shown\nin Fig. 7 suggest a continuing decreasing trend in the second half of the century, by a few per cent in the\nlower stratosphere and upper troposphere.\nIn summary, the estimated change of solar irradiance between the Little Ice Age and the mid\ntwentieth century is insufficient to explain the observed warming of the climate. Absence of evidence for\na long-term variation of solar irradiance does not, of course, rule it out; precision satellite measurements\nof solar irradiance have only be available for the last 30 yr. On the other hand, there has been a substantial\nincrease of solar magnetic activity since the Little Ice Age, and a corresponding reduction of the cosmic\nray intensity. This suggests that the possibility of an indirect solar mechanism due to cosmic-ray forcing\nof the climate should be seriously considered.\n2.2 Holocene; last 10 ky\n2.2.1 Ice-rafted debris in the North Atlantic Ocean\nEvidence for millennial-scale climate variability during the Holocene has been found in the sediments\nof ice-rafted debris in the North Atlantic [59, 60]. Deep sea cores reveal layers of foraminifera shells\nmixed with tiny stones that were frozen into the bases of advancing glaciers and then rafted out to sea by\nglaciers. These reveal abrupt episodes when cool, ice-bearing waters from the North Atlantic advanced\nas far south as the latitude of southern Ireland, coincident with changes in the atmospheric circulation\nrecorded in Greenland. These so-called Bond events (named after their discoverer) have occurred with\na varying periodicity of 1470\u00b1530 y, during which temperatures dropped and glacial calving increased.\nThe estimated decreases in North Atlantic Ocean surface temperatures are about 2\u25e6C, or 20% of the full\nHolocene-to-glacial temperature difference.\nWhat could be the trigger for this millennial-scale climate change? Orbital variations of insolation\nare too slow to cause such rapid changes. Ice sheet oscillations are also unlikely to be the forcing agent,\nfor two main reasons. Firstly, the icebergs were launched simultaneously from more than one glacier.\nSecondly, the events continued with the same quasi-1500 y periodicity for at least the last 30 ky through\nthe Holocene and into the last glacial maximum (but with a larger amount of ice-rafted material)\u2014even\nthough the ice sheet conditions changed dramatically over this interval. Solar/GCR variability appears\nto be a promising candidate for the forcing agent during the Holocene phase since it is found to be\nhighly correlated with the Bond events (Fig. 8) [61]. Good agreement is seen between the 14C (Fig. 8a)\nand 10Be (Fig. 8b) records, which confirms they are indeed measuring changes of the GCR flux, since\ntheir respective transport processes from the atmosphere to archive are completely different. After its\nformation, 14C is rapidly oxidised to 14CO2 and then enters the carbon cycle and may reach a tree-ring\narchive. On the other hand, 10Be attaches to aerosols and eventually settles as rain or snow, where it\nmay become embedded in a stable ice-sheet archive. The correlation between high GCR flux and cold\nNorth Atlantic temperatures embraces the Little Ice Age, which is seen not as an isolated phenomenon\nbut rather as the most recent of around ten such events during the Holocene. This suggests that the Sun\nmay spend a substantial fraction of time in a magnetically-quiet state.\nCoincident millennial scale shifts in Holocene climate have now been observed in regions far\nfrom the North Atlantic. In the sub-polar North Pacific, variations of biogenic silica measured in the\nsediment from Arolik Lake in a tundra region of south-western Alaska reveal cyclic variations in climate\nand ecosystems over a 10 ky period that are coincident with the Bond events [62]. High GCR flux is\nassociated with low biogenic activity. In equatorial Africa, a 5.4 ky record of rainfall and drought in Lake\nEdward indicates northward and southward displacement of the ITCZ in phase with the Bond events [63].\nIn southern China, analysis of a stalagmite from Dongge Cave has provided a continuous, high resolution\nrecord of the East Asian monsoon over the past 9 ky [64]. Although broadly following summer insolation,\nit is punctuated by 6\u20138 weak monsoon periods, each lasting 100\u2013500 y, which coincide with the Bond\nevents. A high correlation is found over this entire period between the Dongge Cave monsoon record (5\ny resolution) and the 14C record (20 y resolution).\n8\nFig. 8: Correlation of GCR variability with ice-rafted debris events in the North Atlantic during the Holocene: a)\nthe 14C record (correlation coefficient 0.44) and b) the 10Be record (0.56), together with the combined ice-rafted-\ndebris tracers [61].\nThese results confirm the pattern seen in Fig. 4 for the Little Ice Age, and extend it throughout the\nHolocene, namely a high cosmic ray flux is associated with a southerly displacement of the ITCZ. Taken\ntogether, the observations suggest that solar/GCR forcing has been responsible for significant centennial\nand millennial scale climate variability during the entire Holocene, on a global scale.\n2.2.2 Indian Ocean monsoon\nA high resolution record of the Indian Ocean monsoon over the period from 9.6 to 6.2 ky ago has been\nobtained by analysing the \u03b418O composition in the layers of a stalagmite from a cave in Oman [65].\nThe \u03b418O is measured in calcium carbonate, which was deposited in isotopic equilibrium with the water\nthat flowed at the time of formation of the stalagmite. Oman today has an arid climate and lies beyond\nthe most northerly excursion of the ITCZ, which determines the region of heavy rainfall of the Indian\nOcean monsoon system. Stalagmite growth is evidence that the northern migration of the ITCZ reached\nhigher latitudes at earlier times. In this region, the temperature shifts during the Holocene are estimated\nto account for only 0.25 per mil variation in \u03b418O [65], and so the \u03b418O variations are mainly due to\nchanges of rainfall. The data are shown in Fig. 9a, together with \u220614C measured in tree rings such as\nthe California bristlecone pine. The two timescales have been tuned to match bumps within the known\nexperimental errors (smooth shifts have been applied to the U-Th dates up to a maximum of 190 y).\nDuring a 430-y period centred around 8.1 ky BP, the stalagmite grew at a rate of 0.55 mm/y\u2014an order\nof magnitude faster than at other times\u2014which allowed a high resolution \u03b418O measurement to be made\n(Fig. 9b). The striking similarity between the \u03b418O and \u220614C data indicates that that solar/GCR activity\ntightly controlled the strength of the Indian Ocean monsoon during this 3,000-year period. Increased\nGCR intensity is associated with a weakening of the monsoon (decreased rainfall) and a southerly shift\nof the ITCZ, confirming with high time resolution the previous observations .\n9\nFig. 9: Profiles of \u03b418O from a U-Th-dated stalagmite from a cave in Oman, together with \u220614C from tree rings\nin California bristlecone pines and elsewhere, for a) the 3.4 ky period from 9.6 to 6.2 ky BP (before present) and\nb) the 430 y period from 8.33 to 7.9 ky BP [65].\n2.3 Quaternary; last 3 My\n2.3.1 Stalagmite growth in Oman and Austria\nThere are two primary archives of past GCR changes: the 14C record preserved in tree rings, and the\n10Be record in ice cores and ocean sediments. Since 14C has a relatively short lifetime (\u03c41/2 = 5730 y,\ncompared with 1.5 My for 10Be), it is only useful for the period up to about about 40 ky ago. In order\nto determine the atmospheric production rate of these radioisotopes (i.e. the GCR flux) from the mea-\nsured concentrations in a particular climate archive, the transport effects between the atmosphere and\nthe archive must be accounted for. The transport of both 14C and 10Be is strongly influenced by differ-\nences between glacial and interglacial climates. Although 14CO2 is well-mixed in the atmosphere, the\nconcentration is influenced by any changes in ocean ventilation or the extent of sea ice, since the deep\nocean is relatively 14CO2-depleted. In the case of 10Be, changes in atmospheric circulation may sample\ndifferent latitudinal regions with different 10Be concentrations. Moreover, the deposition flux depends\nstrongly on the relative rate of wet and dry deposition. For the present climate, the deposition flux of\n10Be in mid-latitude storm tracks is a factor 10 higher than over polar ice sheets, where dry deposition is\ncomparable to (Greenland) or even exceeds (Antarctic) wet deposition [66]. Extracting the 10Be atmo-\nspheric production rate from the measured flux into the ice sheets therefore has additional uncertainties\nwhen large variations occur in the hydrological cycle and in the ice accumulation rates, such as during\nglacial-interglacial transitions.\nHowever, these difficulties are largely avoided in deep ocean sediments, where the 10Be settling\ntime is about 1 ky, rather than the rapid (1 wk \u2013 1 y) settling time onto the ice sheets. Although the\nlong settling time means the ocean archives are insensitive to rapid changes, it has the advantage of a\n10\nFig. 10: Comparison of the growth periods of stalagmites in Austria and Oman with a) 65\u25e6N June insolation and\nb) the relative GCR flux (10Be ocean sediments; note inverted scale) [68]. The growth periods are indicated by\nshaded bands (Spannagel cave) or boxes (Hoti cave). Growth periods at Spannagel cave require warm temperatures,\nclose to the present climate; growth periods at Hoti cave require a moist climate. Periods without stalagmite growth\nare unshaded. The dashed curves in b) indicate the estimated corrections of systematic errors in the SPECMAP\ntimescale, on which the GCR record is based. The growth periods appear to be associated with intervals of low\nGCR flux, close to present values.\nreduced sensitivity to regional variations of production or transport through the atmosphere, ensuring a\nmeasurement of global GCR flux. A recent reconstruction of the global 10Be production rate during the\nlast 220 ky using combined sediment cores from the Pacific, Atlantic and Southern Oceans shows that\nthe GCR flux was generally around 20\u201340% higher than today (Fig. 10b) [67, 68]. This is consistent\nwith palaeointensity reconstructions, both in sign and magnitude, which find an average geomagnetic\nfield strength over this period around 30\u201340% weaker than today [69]. It is also consistent with the\nobserved rise in 14C production during the period from 10 ky to 45 ky before present, with roughly equal\ncontributions from the geomagnetic field changes and from changes in the global carbon cycle [70]. On\nthe other hand, a recent reconstruction [71] of the 10Be flux for the last 50 ky from the Greenland ice\ncore finds no sign of any increase in the 10Be flux between 10 ky and 30 ky before present, and attributes\nthe discrepancy to the 14C data underestimating changes in the carbon cycle\u2014although with large errors\nthat allow for changes of up to 20% in the production rate (GCR flux).\nThe ocean core 10Be data show several 10\u201315 ky intervals over the last 220 ky when the GCR\nflux returned to present levels (Fig. 10b). These changes are largely due to geomagnetic variability,\nwhich is independently measured from palaeointensity data [69], although there may also be contribu-\ntions from solar variability. During the periods of low GCR flux, stalagmite growth was observed in\ncaves located in Oman (Hoti cave) and Austria (Spannagel cave). In contrast, the stalagmite growth\nperiods show no clear pattern of association with 65\u25e6N June insolation, contrary to the expectations of\nthe standard Milankovitch model (Fig. 10a). The growth periods are precisely dated by U/Th analysis to\na 2\u03c3 precision of 1 ky (Spannagel) or 4 ky (Hoti). The growth of stalagmites at each of these locations\nis especially sensitive to climate variations. In the case of Oman, water availability requires a warm\nclimate and monsoon rains. The observed growth periods of the Oman stalagmite extend the Holocene\nobservation shown in Fig. 9 back through the last two glaciations and interglacial\u2014albeit with poorer\ntime resolution\u2014namely, decreased GCR intensity is associated with a strengthening of the monsoon\n11\n(increased rainfall) and a northerly shift of the ITCZ in summer. In the case of Austria, Spannagel cave\nis situated at 2,500 m altitude in the Zillertal Alps, where the present mean air temperature is (1.5\u00b11)\u25e6C.\nConsequently, because of permafrost, stalagmites will not grow at Spannagel if the mean air temperature\noutside the cave falls by only a small amount below present values.\nAmong the serious challenges to the Milankovitch model for the glacial cycles is the timing of\nTermination II, the penultimate deglaciation. The growth period of stalagmite SPA 52 from Spannagel\nCave began at 135\u00b11.2 ky BP [72] (Fig. 10b). So, by that time, temperatures in central Europe were\nwithin 1\u25e6C or so of the present day. This corroborates the conclusion, based on sediment cores off the\nBahamas, that warming was well underway at 135\u00b12.5 ky [73]. Furthermore, dating of a Barbados coral\nterrace shows that the sea level had risen to within 20% of its peak value by 135.8\u00b10.8 ky [74]. These\nresults confirm the \u201cearly\u201d timing of Termination II, originally discovered at Devil\u2019s Hole Cave, Nevada\n[75]. This implies that the warming at the end of the penultimate ice age was underway at the minimum\nof 65\u25e6N June insolation, and essentially complete about 8 ky prior to the insolation maximum (Fig. 10a).\nThe Milankovitch model therefore suffers a causality problem: Termination II precedes its supposed\ncause. Furthermore, an analysis of deep ocean cores shows that the warming of the tropical Pacific Ocean\nat Termination II preceded the northern ice sheet melting by 2\u20133 ky [76]. In short, orbital increases of\nsolar insolation on the northern ice sheets could not have driven the penultimate deglaciation\u2014contrary\nto the expectations of the Milankovitch model.\nThe 10Be data, on the other hand, show that the GCR flux began to decrease around 150 ky, and had\nreached present levels by about 135 ky (Fig. 10b). This is compatible with Termination II being driven\nin part by a reduction of GCR flux\u2014although the present 10Be measurements have large experimental\nerrors. A similar reduction of GCR flux also occurred around 20 ky BP due to a rise in the geomagnetic\nfield strength towards present values. This coincides with the first signs of warming at the end of the last\nglaciation, as recorded in the Antarctic ice at about 18 ky BP. Higher-precision 10Be data from ocean\ncores, extending to earlier times, are required to investigate this association more closely.\nDespite the discrepancies with the Milankovitch model, it remains the only established mechanism\nthat could imprint the orbital frequencies on the glacial cycles. At present the GCR measurements from\nthe 10Be record in ocean sediments have neither sufficient time span nor sufficient precision for spectral\nanalysis and a precise comparison with the orbital frequencies. Nevertheless, spectral analysis of the\nGCR record during the last 220 ky (Fig. 10b) reveals two strong peaks consistent with orbital frequencies,\nnamely 0.01 c/ky (100 ky period) and 0.024 c/ky (41 ky) [77]. A higher-precision record of the GCR\nflux over the past few hundred thousand years should in principle be available from the 10Be record\nin ice cores, but the challenge here is to disentangle real production rate changes from climate effects\non the transport of 10Be into the ice. There are two possible mechanisms that could modulate GCR\nionisation with the orbital frequencies. Firstly, it is speculated that orbital variations could influence the\ngeodynamo, and thereby the GCR flux [78]. Some long-term records of Earth\u2019s magnetic field suggest\nthe presence of orbital frequencies, in both strength and magnetic inclination [79, 80], but others do not\n[69]. Secondly, as discussed later in this paper, it is plausible that lightning activity could be modulated\nby the orbital insolation cycles. If so, this would modulate the ionospheric potential and the atmospheric\ncurrent density resulting from cosmic-ray ionisation in the atmosphere.\n2.3.2 Laschamp event\nIf cosmic rays are indeed forcing the climate then there should be a climatic response to geomagnetic\nreversals or excursions (\u201cfailed reversal\u201d events during which the geomagnetic field dips to a low value\nbut returns with the same polarity). A relatively recent excursion was the Laschamp event, when the\ngeomagnetic field fell briefly to around 10% of its present strength and the global 10Be production rate\napproximately doubled [81]. Based on several independent radioisotope measurements, the Laschamp\nevent has been precisely dated at (40.4\u00b12.0) ky ago (2\u03c3 error) [82].\nNo evidence of climate change was observed in the GRIP (Greenland) ice core during the Laschamp\n12\nevent [83]. However, this analysis applied a low pass filter to the 10Be and climate (\u03b418O and CH4) mea-\nsurements, with a cutoff frequency of 1/3000 y\u22121. This is substantially below the estimated 1500 y\nduration of the Laschamp event [84] and has the effect of broadening (diluting) the signal region to\n5.5 ky. When the GRIP data are viewed with higher resolution, the Laschamp 10Be signal coincides with\na Dansgaard-Oeschger warming event (both the warming and cooling phases), and so it is difficult to\ndraw a firm conclusion on the absence or presence of an additional GCR-induced climate signal.\nSeveral climatic effects coincident with the Laschamp event were recorded elsewhere. A pro-\nnounced reduction of the East Asia monsoon was registered in Hulu Cave, China [85]. At the same\ntime, a brief wet period was recorded in speleothems found in tropical northeastern Brazil\u2014a region that\nis presently semi-arid [86]. The wet period was precisely U/Th dated to last 700\u00b1400 y from 39.6 to\n38.9 ky ago; this was the only recorded period of stalagmite growth in the 30 ky interval from 47 to 16 ky\nago. Further evidence has recently been found in deep-sea cores from the South Atlantic, by analysing\nNd isotopes as a sensitive proxy of the thermohaline ocean circulation [87]. A brief, sharp reduction of\nNorth Atlantic deep water (NADW) production was recorded (i.e. towards colder conditions), coincident\nwith the Laschamp event.\nThis pattern of climate response to the Laschamp excursion of little or no signal at high latitudes\n(Greenland) but possible signals at low latitudes (China, Brazil, NADW\u2014perhaps reflecting Gulf Stream\nsalinity changes) is consistent with what could be expected from a geomagnetic dip. For a primary cos-\nmic ray to produce ionisation in the lower troposphere, it must create a secondary muon of at least 2 GeV\nto have sufficient energy to pass through the atmosphere. This implies a primary proton energy of at least\nabout 9 GeV which, for the present geomagnetic field, corresponds to the geomagnetic cutoff at a latitude\nof about 40\u25e6. So, for Greenland (which lies above 60\u25e6N), the cosmic ray flux in the lower troposphere is\npresently limited by the atmospheric column density and not by the geomagnetic field strength. Even a\nlarge reduction of the geomagnetic field\u2014such as during the Laschamp event\u2014would not significantly\nincrease the lower tropospheric ionisation over Greenland (although it would produce a large spike in\n10Be, as observed [83], since this reflects the combined tropospheric and global stratospheric ionisation).\nThe regions that would first be affected by a geomagnetic dip are at low latitudes, where the tropospheric\nionisation is presently limited by the geomagnetic cutoff; these are indeed the regions that seem to in-\ndicate some climate correlations with the Laschamp event. Higher latitudinal regions could be affected\nlater in response to the low-latitude climate changes. However, the short duration of the Laschamp event\nmay not have been sufficient to allow for significant additional cooling to take place at the latitudes of\nthe northern ice sheets, which were already under predominantly-glacial conditions.\n2.4 Phanerozoic; last 550 My\n2.4.1 Celestial cycles\nTropical sea surface temperatures throughout the Phanerozoic have been reconstructed from the \u03b418O of\ncalcite and aragonite shells found in ocean sediments (30\u25e6S\u201330\u25e6N) [88]. After detrending and smoothing\nthe data, the reconstructed temperatures (Fig. 11b) show an oscillating behaviour that matches reasonably\nwell with Earth\u2019s icehouse and greenhouse climate modes, established from sediment analyses elsewhere\n(indicated at the top of Fig. 11).\nIndependently, a correlation was noted between the occurrence of ice-age epochs on Earth and\ncrossings of the spiral arms of the Milky Way by the solar system, during which elevated GCR fluxes\nof up to a factor of two are estimated (Fig. 11a) [89]. The GCR flux is higher within the spiral arms\nowing to the relative proximity of the supernovae generators and the subsequent diffusive trapping of\nthe energetic charged particles by the interstellar magnetic fields. The estimated crossing periodicity of\nabout 140 My is supported by the GCR exposure age recorded in iron meteorites [89]. Both the GCR\nflux and ocean temperatures appear to follow the same cyclic behaviour and the same phase (Fig. 11b),\nwhereas estimated CO2 levels do not [90]. These observations have been both disputed [91, 92] and\nsupported [93, 94]. However, on quite general grounds, it is hard to conceive of anything other than a\n13\nFig. 11: Correlation of cosmic rays and climate over the past 500 My [90]: a) GCR mean flux variations as the\nsolar system passes through the spiral arms of the Milky Way, reconstructed from iron meteorite exposure ages\n[89], and b) ocean temperature anomalies reconstructed from \u03b418O in calcite shells found in sediments from the\ntropical seas [88]. Panel a) shows the nominal reconstructed GCR flux (black curve) and the error range (grey\nband). The dashed red curves in panels a) and b) shows the best fit of the GCR flux to the temperature data (solid\nblue curve in panel b), within the allowable error (note inverted GCR scale in panel b). The data are de-trended\nand smoothed. The dark bars at the top represent cool climate modes for Earth (icehouses) and the light bars are\nwarm modes (greenhouses), as established from sediment analyses elsewhere.\ngalactic mechanism to account for a 140 My periodicity.\nHigher frequency components of the temperature data in Fig. 11b have also been analysed [95].\nSignificant power is found at 34 My period, and this matches both the estimated phase and period\n(34\u00b16 My) for crossings of the galactic plane by the solar system. This motion corresponds to oscilla-\ntions above and below the galactic plane with a full cycle of 64\u201368 My [94, 95]; and it is independent of\nthe motion in the galactic plane, as analysed in ref. [89].\nAn alternative mechanism has been proposed to explain these apparently galactic-related period-\nicities. When passing through the spiral arms of the galaxy, as well as experiencing a higher cosmic ray\nflux, the solar system encounters giant molecular clouds [96]. These are the remnants of supernovae, and\ncomprise 99% gas and 1% dust grains. In extreme cases the clouds may reach densities as high as 2000\nH atoms cm\u22123. This may be compared with about 0.3 H atoms cm\u22123 in the present local interstellar\ncloud which, nevertheless, gives rise to about 40,000 tons of extraterrestrial matter falling on Earth\u2019s sur-\nface each year. Passage through high density interstellar clouds would cause the heliosphere to collapse\nbelow 1 AU, exposing the stratosphere to large quantities of interstellar dust and potentially triggering a\n\u201csnowball\u201d glaciation on Earth by radiative forcing [97]. Collapse of the heliospheric shield would also\nlead to a large increase of GCR flux on Earth; the 10Be rate is estimated to increase up to 400% of the\npresent value [98]. Thankfully, present estimates suggest that the frequency of encounter of the solar\nsystem with an interstellar cloud of >2000 H atoms cm\u22123 is rather low (of order one per Gy).\n2.4.2 Biodiversity\nThe diversity of life during the course of the Phanerozoic has fluctuated. Analysis of the fluctuations\nof the number of marine genera has revealed a strong (62\u00b13) My cycle and a weaker cycle at 140 My\n[99]. The 140 My cycle may be associated with the GCR-climate cycle, but cold periods in \u03b418O precede\n14\nthe 140 My diversity maxima by 20\u201325 My. The stronger 62 My cycle does not have any clear origin\n(a GCR effect due to the vertical oscillation relative to the galactic disk should show up as a 34 My\ncycle). Using databases covering the Precambrian (4500\u2013543 My ago) and Phanerozoic, an independent\nmeasurement of the biodiversity fluctuations has been made from changes of the biological tracer, \u03b413C\n[100]. These show a remarkable agreement with the reconstructed GCR flux over a 3.5 By period, based\non the expected solar evolution and rate of formation in our galaxy of massive stars that ended life as\nsupernovae.\nAn alternative way in which the galactic environment could affect cosmic rays and biodiversity\nis through isolated events, namely nearby Type IIa supernovae, which could produce a \u201ccosmic ray\nwinter\u201d [101]. Around one such event is expected per My at a distance of a few \u00d7 10 pc. The first direct\nevidence for a close supernova explosion has recently been obtained from an enhancement in the fraction\nof the 60Fe radioisotope (\u03c41/2 = 1.5 My) in a deep-sea ferromagnetic crust [102]. The measurements\nunambiguously show the presence of a nearby supernova that occurred 2.8 My ago; the 60Fe amounts\nare compatible with a distance of a few \u00d7 10 pc. This is estimated to have increased the GCR flux by\naround 15% for a period of about 100 ky. Under the assumption of GCR-climate forcing, this would\nhave caused a prolonged cold period; coincidentally or not, the onset of northern hemisphere glaciation\noccurred at the same time.\n3 MECHANISMS\n3.1 GCR-cloud mechanisms\n3.1.1 GCR characteristics\nGalactic cosmic rays mainly comprise high energy protons which have been accelerated by supernovae\nand other energetic sources in the Milky Way galaxy. The main flux is in the energy region of a few\nGeV, although the spectrum extends eleven orders of magnitude higher (albeit with negligible intensity).\nThe primary cosmic rays interact in the atmosphere at around 30 km altitude, producing showers of\nsecondary particles which penetrate the troposphere; below 7 km, the secondaries are mainly muons.\nThe charged cosmic rays lose energy by ionisation and, away from continental sources of radon, are\nresponsible for essentially all of the fair-weather ionisation in the troposphere. Ion-pair production rates\nvary between about 2 cm\u22123s\u22121 at ground level, 10 cm\u22123s\u22121 at 5 km, and 20\u201350 cm\u22123s\u22121 at 15 km\naltitude, depending on geomagnetic latitude. Taking into account production rates and loss mechanisms\nsuch as recombination and attachment to aerosols, the equilibrium ion pair concentrations vary between\nabout 200\u2013500 cm\u22123 at ground level and 1000\u20133000 cm\u22123 in the lower stratosphere [103]. The GCR\nflux is modulated (typically by a few tens of per cent, depending on latitude and altitude) by the solar\nwind, the geomagnetic field strength and the galactic environment of the solar system. Since these vary\nover periods from tens to billions of years, a putative GCR-climate forcing has the potential to affect\nclimate on all time scales.\nTwo different classes of mechanisms have been proposed to link the GCR flux with clouds. The\nfirst hypothesis is that the ionisation from GCRs influences the production of new aerosol particles in\nthe atmosphere, which then grow and may eventually increase the number of cloud condensation nuclei\n(CCN), upon which cloud droplets form. The second hypothesis is that GCR ionisation modulates the\nentire ionosphere-Earth electric current which, in turn, influences cloud properties through charge effects\non droplet freezing and other microphysical processes.\n3.1.2 Ion-induced nucleation of new aerosols\nAerosols are continuously removed from the atmosphere by wet and dry sedimentation, by self coagu-\nlation, and by scavenging in clouds. As a result they have short lifetimes\u2014of order a day\u2014and the rate\nat which new aerosols are produced can have a large influence on clouds. An important source of new\naerosols is thought to be nucleation from trace condensable vapours in atmosphere, but these processes\n15\nremain poorly understood [104]. The atmosphere contains very few trace gases that are suitable for nu-\ncleation; the most important is thought to be sulphuric acid, although ammonia and iodine oxides may\nalso be significant. However, the concentration of sulphuric acid in the atmosphere is generally too low\nto drive the subsequent growth to CCN sizes. Over land masses, organic compounds such as acetone\nand the oxidation products of terpenes emitted by trees are thought to be important for aerosol growth.\nIn marine regions, isoprene oxidation products and iodine oxides are thought to participate in aerosol\ngrowth.\nFig. 12: Ion-induced nucleation of new particles from trace condensable vapours and water in the atmosphere.\nNew aerosols consist of small clusters containing as few as two molecules (Fig. 12). These may\ngrow by further condensation of molecules of trace vapours and water\u2014or they may evaporate. Above\na certain critical size, the cluster is thermodynamically more likely to grow by further condensation;\nbelow the critical size, it is more likely to shrink by evaporation. The presence of charge stabilises the\nembryonic cluster through Coulomb attraction, and reduces the critical size\u2014a process known as ion\ninduced nucleation [105, 106, 107].\nAs well as inducing particle formation, charge also accelerates the early growth process, due to\nan enhanced collision probability, and thereby increases the fraction of particles that survive removal by\ncoagulation before reaching sizes of 5 nm [108]. Beyond this size, electrostatic effects are thought to be\nnegligible, but coagulation rates also fall strongly due to the lower particle mobility. So, with regard to\nenhancing the survival of new particles to CCN sizes, charge operates precisely in the most critical range,\nbelow 5 nm. Nevertheless, only a small fraction of new particles reach the minimum size to be effective\nCCN (about 50 nm), since most are lost by scavenging on existing aerosols. Geographical regions of\nvery low pre-existing aerosol loading are therefore the most favorable for growth of fresh CCN from\nnew particle production.\nParticle formation in the upper troposphere tends to occur readily since the condensable vapours\nare often supersaturated (due primarily to the low ambient temperatures and the small pre-existing aerosol\nsurface area). In the boundary layer, however, nucleation tends to occur during \u201caerosol bursts\u201d, char-\nacterised by long periods without any new production followed by brief periods of rapid production and\ngrowth lasting a few hours. These bursts presumably occur when the threshold conditions, such as trace\nvapour concentrations, are reached so that nucleation and/or growth to detectable sizes [109] can take\nplace. In ion induced nucleation models, the presence of charge from GCRs lowers this threshold. The\n16\nobserved particle production rates are typically in the range 0.1\u201310 cm\u22123s\u22121, although they may be as\nhigh as 104 cm\u22123s\u22121 or more [104]. In the lower troposphere the ion pair production rate from GCRs\nis about 5 cm\u22123s\u22121 and the equilibrium small ion concentration is about 500 cm\u22123, so only some of\nthe nucleation events could be readily explained by ions. A further complication in assessing the contri-\nbution of ions to nucleation bursts is that the counting threshold of present instruments is 3 nm aerosol\nsize, whereas the nucleation occurs around 0.5 nm. A large but uncertain fraction of new particles may\ntherefore be lost by coagulation before they are detected, so the true nucleation rate has not yet been\nmeasured [110]. In addition, a large population of neutral ultrafine aerosol may exist below the 3 nm\nthreshold, whose growth is inhibited due to lack of condensable vapours [109]. In this case, it is possible\nthat ion induced nucleation could slowly populate the ultrafine aerosols over an extended time, allowing\na mechanism for large aerosol bursts that exceed the instantaneous ion-pair production rate from GCRs.\nThere is some experimental and observational evidence to support the presence of ion induced\nnucleation in the atmosphere. Early studies, beginning in the 1960\u2019s, [111, 112] demonstrated ultrafine\nparticle production from ions in the laboratory, at ion production rates typically found in the lower\natmosphere. This has also been found in a more recent laboratory experiment, under conditions closer to\nthose found in the atmosphere [113]. Observations of ion-induced nucleation in the upper troposphere\nhave also been reported [114, 115] and also of aerosol bursts in the lower troposphere [116], although\ntheir rate frequently exceeds what could be caused by instantaneous ion-induced nucleation. Laboratory\nmeasurements have shown that ions are indeed capable, under certain conditions, of suppressing or even\nremoving the barrier to nucleation in embryonic molecular clusters of water and sulphuric acid at typical\natmospheric concentrations, so that nucleation takes place at a rate simply determined by the collision\nfrequency [117, 118, 119].\n3.1.3 Global electric circuit\nThe second mechanism that may link GCR flux and clouds concerns the effect of GCRs on the global\nelectric current flowing between the ionosphere and Earth\u2019s surface [120, 121]. Except for a contribution\nfrom radioactive isotopes near the land surface, GCRs are responsible for generating all the fair-weather\natmospheric ionisation between ground level and the mid mesosphere, at about 65 km altitude. As such,\nGCRs fundamentally underpin the global electrical circuit.\nThe atmospheric electric circuit involves a global current of about 1400 A (and 400 MW power)\nwhich is sustained by thunderstorms continuously active over tropical land masses (Fig. 13) [122, 123].\nThe thunderstorms carry negative charge to the ground and an equivalent positive current flows up to the\nionosphere. Due to the high currents, large electric fields are generated above thunderstorms and the air\ncan break down electrically to produce optical flashes known as sprites and elves. This current generator\nmaintains the ionosphere at a relative positive potential of about 250 kV. The return current between\nthe ionosphere and the Earth\u2019s surface flows throughout the atmosphere, in regions of disturbed and\nundisturbed weather, and is carried by vertical drift of small ions; the average fair-weather vertical current\ndensity, Jz , is 2.7 pA m\u22122 [122, 123]. By controlling the lower atmospheric ion pair concentration, GCRs\ncan affect Jz , the atmospheric conductivity, the ionospheric potential, and the vertical potential gradient\nin the atmosphere. In polar regions, these quantities are also influenced by low energy ionising particles\nfrom relativistic (\u223c1 MeV) electron precipitation, which may occur during crossings of the solar wind\nmagnetic sector boundaries.\nDecadel changes in the ionospheric potential and surface potential gradient have in fact been ob-\nserved and attributed to changes in the GCR flux [124, 125]. The positive correlation observed between\nGCR flux and surface potential gradient [125] would imply an influence on the current source in order\nto sustain the higher net flow of fair-weather charge through the atmosphere, which, at the same time,\nhas a higher conductivity. The simplest explanation is that the GCRs affect the conductivity or electrical\nbreakdown between the top of thunderstorms and the ionosphere; increased GCR flux could then lead to\nincreased current generation.\n17\nFig. 13: Schematic of the global electrical circuit. The current generators are thunderstorms, which are located\npredominantly over tropical land masses. The return path is the global fair-weather current flowing between the\nionosphere and ground. It varies between 1 and 4 pA/m2, depending on the local atmospheric columnar resistance,\nwhich is mainly determined by the surface altitude and the GCR flux. A continuous current supply is required to\nmaintain the ionospheric potential near +250 kV since the decay time constant of the ionosphere-ground spherical\ncapacitor is only about 2 minutes.\nIn addition to GCR variations, the global electrical circuit is affected by coupling between the\nmagnetosphere and the solar wind. The relative velocity between the magnetosphere and the interplan-\netary magnetic field (IMF) carried by the solar wind plasma generates additional potential distributions\nsuperimposed on the global ionospheric potential. These include a dawn-dusk potential difference of\n30\u2013150 kV across each polar cap ionosphere (generated by the north-south component of the solar wind\nmagnetic field, Bz), and a potential difference of several tens of kV between the northern polar cap and\nthe southern polar cap ionosphere (generated by the east-west component, By). Moreover, when Bz\npoints in a southerly direction, the interplanetary magnetic field directly couples with the geomagnetic\nfield and gives rise to intense auroral activity in the polar regions, involving greatly enhanced charge\ndeposition at high altitudes (above 30km, with bremsstrahlung X- and gamma rays constituting the most\npenetrating radiation).\nWhat effect might these changes in the electrical circuit have on the climate? The basic hypothesis\nis that the vertical conduction current generates highly charged droplets (>\u223c100 e) at the upper and lower\nboundaries of clouds (Fig. 14) [120]. When these droplets evaporate they leave behind highly charged\nand coated \u201cevaporation nuclei\u201d. Some of these will be ice nuclei: particles that induce ice formation.\nField measurements show that the tops of clouds frequently contain a great deal of supercooled liquid\nwater in the temperature range -40\u25e6C to 0\u25e6C, since ice nuclei are rare in the atmosphere. The highly\ncharged evaporation nuclei may then be entrained inside the clouds, where their charge may enhance\ncollisions with liquid cloud droplets by \u201celectroscavenging\u201d [126]. If the charged aerosol is an ice nu-\ncleus, this will induce freezing by so-called contact nucleation, which is a particularly efficient freezing\nmechanism [127]. This would imply that increased GCR intensity leads to increased ice particle forma-\ntion in clouds. The formation of ice crystals in clouds strongly influences cloud precipitation since ice\ncrystals grow rapidly in the presence of liquid water. Furthermore, the release of latent heat can influence\natmospheric dynamics.\nIn addition to droplet freezing, high electric charges will affect the microphysics of the liquid-\nphase droplets by modifying the collision efficiency of aerosol particles and droplets. Early laboratory\n18\nFig. 14: Schematic showing the creation of unipolar space charge at the top and bottom of clouds due to the drift\nions from cosmic rays in the fair weather electric field. This space charge can become attached to droplets and\naerosol particles, and then entrained within clouds where it may influence microphysical cloud interactions.\nstudies found that raindrops (of around 0.5 mm diameter) are about a factor 100 more efficient at col-\nlecting aerosol when they are charged rather than neutral [128]. If only one particle is charged, then the\ncollision efficiency is always enhanced since image charges are attractive. In the case of both particles\nhaving the same charge, the effect can be either attractive or repulsive. For aerosols colliding with large\ncloud droplets (>10 \u00b5m), the effect of greater same-sign charge is to increase the collision efficiency\u2014\nby up to an order of magnitude for 100e charged droplets [129]. However, for aerosols or small droplets\n(<4 \u00b5m), same-sign charge leads to a strong suppression of collision efficiency\u2014by up to several orders\nof magnitude for 100e charged aerosols or particles.\nThe proposed mechanism linking GCRs, the atmospheric electrical current and cloud particle col-\nlision efficiencies and droplet freezing rates is plausible. However, direct observations in the atmosphere\nof changes in cloud properties due to changes in the ionosphere-earth current have not yet been made,\nand are unlikely to succeed in the near future since there is only a very poor understanding at present of\nwhat controls ice formation in clouds\u2014even in the absence of any ionisation effect. Moreover, even the\nsign of a possible ionisation effect is ambiguous, since it depends on the details of the particle size and\ncharge distributions involved.\n3.2 GCR-cloud observations\n3.2.1 Interannual time scale\nStudies of the effects on clouds of atmospheric ions from cosmic rays extend as far back as C.T.R. Wilson\nat the beginning of the last century, whose work on simulating ion-droplet processes led to a Nobel Prize\nfor the cloud chamber [130]. The cosmic ray link between clouds and solar variability was originally\npostulated in detail by Dickinson [131] in 1975, expanding on a suggestion made by Ney [132] in 1959.\nCorrelations between cosmic ray changes and clouds were first reported in the 1990\u2019s by Pudovkin [133]\nand by Svensmark [13]. Since these first observations there have been a large number of papers in the\nliterature either disputing (e.g. [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]) or supporting (e.g. [22, 23, 24]) the presence of\n19\nsignificant correlations between cosmic rays and clouds.\nThe original GCR-cloud observations were based on cloud data from a composite of several satel-\nlites, including a relatively short time series (1983\u20131993) from the ISCCP (International Satellite Cloud\nClimatology Project) [134]. Since then the ISCCP data have been extended over the full period from\nJuly 1983 to June 2005, and they now constitute the longest available continuous global measurement\nof clouds. Almost all cosmic ray-cloud time-series analyses are now based on the ISCCP data product,\nso they cannot be considered as independent results. The cloud measurements are quite challenging,\ninvolving the inter-calibration of instruments on board several geostationary satellites and polar-orbiting\nsatellites, and controlling instrumental drifts to better than 1% over a period of more than 20 years. Al-\nthough the ISCCP low-cloud data appear to follow GCR variations well until 1994 [14], they show a poor\ncorrelation after that time, which is evidence against a continuing GCR-cloud effect [135]. However, it\nhas been suggested that there may be a long-term trend in the cloud data due to other processes, which is\nthen modulated by GCR variations [22]. After detrending the cloud data, a reasonable consistency with\nGCR modulation is found over the full period and, furthermore, the GCR-cloud correlation suggests an\nincreased amplitude at higher latitudes, consistent with what may be expected from GCRs [22]. Ques-\ntions have also been raised about apparent discrepancies between the ISCCP cloud measurements and\nthe independent cloud data from the SSMI (Special Sensor Microwave Imager) instruments on board the\nDMSP (Defence Meteorological Satellite Program) satellites [15]. The discrepancies emerge around the\nend of 1994, which coincides with a period of several months during which no polar-orbiting satellite\nwas available for inter-calibration of the ISCCP geostationary satellites.\nAssuming for the moment that the low cloud data do indeed show a solar imprint, then the modu-\nlation measured for low clouds is about 1% absolute (3% relative), which represents around 0.5 Wm\u22122\nvariation in net radiative forcing at Earth\u2019s surface over the solar cycle\u2014about a factor 2.5 larger than\nthe variation of solar irradiance. Furthermore, the two effects are in phase, namely increased sunspot\nactivity corresponds to increased irradiance, decreased GCR intensity and decreased low cloud amount.\nSince low clouds have a net cooling effect, this implies increased radiative forcing and a warmer climate.\nDuring the first half of the twentieth century, the cosmic ray intensity fell by about one unit of solar cycle\nmodulation (Fig. 6), so a putative GCR-cloud effect could have contributed a long-term radiative forcing\nduring this period of around 0.5 Wm\u22122 , which is substantially larger than the estimated forcing due to\nsolar irradiance changes (Fig. 5). This underscores the importance of establishing whether or not cosmic\nrays do indeed affect clouds.\nIf there is such an effect, it is likely to be restricted to particular geographical locations and at-\nmospheric conditions, such as concentrations of certain trace gases, ambient aerosol concentrations,\ntemperature (altitude), etc. Consequently, it is more appropriate to study GCR-cloud correlations ac-\ncording to geographical region and altitude, rather than globally. Several regional studies have been\nmade, e.g. [14, 15, 136, 137], and the effects of volcanoes and the El Nino\u02dc Southern Oscillation (ENSO)\nalso accounted for [15, 138]. These studies find significant correlations between clouds and GCRs in\ncertain climate-defining regions, and find different correlations depending on whether the clouds are low,\nmedium or high. One study [137] evaluates separately the correlations of low clouds with cosmic rays\nand with UV intensity in order to try to discriminate between the two forcing mechanisms. However, the\nconclusions of all these studies are subject to the uncertainties raised above concerning the presence or\nabsence of a trend in the cloud data, and the open question about possible calibration uncertainties. This\nis especially of concern when trying to distinguish between the various forcing mechanisms [137], since\nall solar indices\u2014irradiance, UV and GCRs\u2014have quite similar variations over the solar cycle.\nOverall, therefore, the present satellite observations, while suggestive, are insufficient either to\nestablish or to rule out an effect of cosmic rays on clouds, and a further extension of the ISCCP data is\nrequired to clarify the situation. The observations do, however, provide sufficient evidence to suggest\nthat a deeper investigation of the effect of cosmic rays on clouds offers the real possibility of fundamental\nnew knowledge on the solar-climate problem.\n20\n3.2.2 Daily time scale\nIn addition to the quasi-11-year solar cycle modulation, GCRs also display sporadic short-term reduc-\ntions known as Forbush decreases. During a Forbush decrease the GCR intensity falls typically by\naround 5% in the first day and then returns to normal levels over the next few (\u223c5) days. Larger Forbush\ndecreases may occur, with as much as 20% reduction of the GCR intensity measured in ground-level\nneutron monitors. They are caused by magnetohydrodynamic disturbances in the solar wind, following\nlarge solar coronal mass ejections. If the ejection is directed towards Earth, the Forbush decrease of\nGCR intensity is generally more pronounced and frequently accompanied by a burst of solar protons,\nwith characteristic energies up to around 300 MeV, which may (over-)compensate the ionisation reduc-\ntion in the stratosphere and upper troposphere. Any atmospheric responses during Forbush and solar\nproton events can be unambiguously associated with changes of ionising particle radiation, without the\nusual ambiguity with solar UV changes over the solar cycle. This, together with their short duration,\nmake Forbush events an important laboratory for testing possible cosmic ray-climate forcing.\nFrom a superposed epoch analysis of Forbush events over the period 1986\u20131994, a small (1.4%\nabsolute) but significant reduction in global cloud cover (recorded in ISCCP data) was found during For-\nbush decreases that are unaccompanied by solar proton events [139]. Significant cloud anomalies were\nfound to be concentrated at high latitudes and most pronounced (up to 30% reduction) in the uppermost\nclouds over Antarctica (at 10-180 mbar, which corresponds to polar stratospheric clouds). In contrast,\nForbush decreases associated with solar proton events showed no significant cloud anomalies. All of\nthese observations are consistent with a GCR-cloud effect in the region of the atmosphere that experi-\nences the greatest change of ionisation during a Forbush decrease (i.e. high latitude and high altitude). A\nrecent update has extended this analysis over the period 1983\u20132000 [140]. Cloud anomalies are found\nwith similar space and time structure as previously, although of smaller magnitude. Pronounced reduc-\ntions of polar stratospheric clouds over Antarctica in association with Forbush decreases are also found\nin the updated analysis, restricted to the local winter months when polar stratospheric clouds are most\nprevalent. However it is pointed out that these results should be treated with caution since the absence\nof daylight over Antarctica during the austral winter precludes multi-spectral analysis in the ISCCP data,\nand so the cloud-type identification relies on infra red measurements alone. Furthermore, the Forbush\nevents are associated with statistically significant positive temperature anomalies over Antarctica, by\nup to 12\u25e6C at the surface and extending throughout the troposphere. This latter observation appears to\nbe inconsistent with a simultaneous reduction of cloud cover, since Antarctic clouds should have a net\nwarming effect due to longwave absorption and re-radiation.\nA wide range of meteorological responses to short-term changes in the global electrical circuit,\ninduced by energetic solar events or crossings of the heliospheric current sheet, have also been reported\nin the literature [141]. They include changes in atmospheric temperature, pressure or dynamics, such as\nan influence of solar proton events on cyclone development in the North Atlantic [142]. The meteoro-\nlogical responses are generally small in magnitude but of high statistical significance. They correspond\nto changes in Jz of around 5% at low latitudes and up to about 25% at high latitudes. Among the most\nclimatically-significant observations is the dramatic deviation of wind directions reported at Antarctic\nstations located in the Western Pacific and near to the south pole (Vostok) in response to disturbances\ncaused by crossings of the solar wind magnetic sector boundaries [143]. The standard wind pattern in\nthe Antarctic is cold katabatic winds that descend over the region due to negative air buoyancy and drain\nradially outwards along the slope of the Antarctic ice sheet. Rapid warming events have been observed\nof up to 20\u25e6C in a few hours, which are found to be associated with a large increase of the southward\n(negative) component of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) carried by the solar wind [143]. This\npolarity couples the IMF with the geomagnetic field and increases the ionisation and Jz of the polar\natmosphere. From the observed pattern of temperature changes with respect to altitude, the meteoro-\nlogical changes are attributed to a cloud layer appearing at 5\u201310 km altitude under the influence of the\nincreased ionisation. Associated with these changes of the IMF are anomalous winds, both in terms of\n21\ntheir direction and high speed. These seem to be associated with ENSO activity, occurring around 1\u20132\nmonths in advance of ENSO, although the present statistical significance is limited. This association of\nsolar magnetic activity with ENSO has been proposed previously, based on analysis of the Sun\u2019s motion\naround the centre-of-mass of the solar system [144].\nAssociations have also been reported between rainfall and cosmic rays. A study of the influence\nof Forbush decreases on precipitation in Brazil and in the former Soviet Union found a decrease of\nrainfall of (17 \u00b1 3)% on the day of the Forbush decrease [57]. On the other hand, for ground-level\nsolar proton events (solar cosmic rays) an increase in rainfall of (13 \u00b1 5)% was found over the same\nperiod. These observations are consistent with a separate study of the relationship of GCR flux with\nglobal precipitation over the period 1979\u20131999 [145]. Both the precipitation and precipitation efficiency\n(ratio of precipitation to total columnar precipitable water) showed a positive correlation with solar-cycle\nGCR variations by 7\u20139% over the latitudinal band 45\u201390\u25e6S. Alternative explanations for the rainfall\nvariations, such as ENSO or changes in tropospheric aerosols, showed poorer statistical relationships.\n3.3 GCR-cloud-climate mechanisms\n3.3.1 Importance of aerosols and clouds\nClouds account for a global average 28 Wm\u22122 net cooling [25], so changes of their coverage or reflectiv-\nity by only a few per cent can have a significant effect on the climate. This figure represents the difference\nbetween the cooling effect due to reflection of the incoming shortwave radiation, and the absorption of\nlongwave terrestrial radiation, which warms the atmosphere and surface. Low-altitude layered clouds\ncovering large areas of the tropics and subtropics make the greatest contribution to cooling Earth since\nthey efficiently reflect intense incoming solar radiation, while at the same time are prodigious emitters of\nlongwave radiation. These are the marine stratus and stratocumulus clouds\u2014the \u201cclimate refrigerators\nof the tropics\u201d [146].\nWater vapour and clouds have an important influence on the redistribution of energy. Evaporation\nfrom the surface carries large amounts of heat away from the surface, and condensation of the rising\nwater vapour releases this heat in the troposphere, supplying energy to atmospheric circulation. Recent\nobservations suggest that precipitation and total atmospheric water have increased at about the same\nrate of 7% per K of surface warming over the past two decades, consistent with the Clausius-Clapeyron\nequation [147]. This implies that current climate models\u2014which predict that global precipitation will\nincrease at only 1\u20133% per K [147]\u2014are substantially under-estimating the transfer of latent heat from the\nsurface to the atmosphere. Latent heat accounts for a radiative transfer of about 80 Wm\u22122 from Earth\u2019s\nsurface, so a 5% discrepancy per K implies about 2 Wm\u22122 under-estimate of latent heat transfer for the\ncurrent warming.\nIce formation is especially important to the energy released by clouds. Air in warm clouds is\ntypically only a few tenths of a per cent super-saturated with respect to liquid water. However, this\nrepresents a large supersaturation with respect to ice (several tens of per cent) and, in consequence,\nany ice particles that are present will grow rapidly at the expense of the water droplets, and induce\nprecipitation by sedimentation.\nA strong connection between aerosol loading and cloud properties has been demonstrated both\nfor shallow [148] and deep convective [149] clouds, using data from the MODerate resolution Imaging\nSpectroradiometer satellite, MODIS [150]. Increased aerosol loading is associated with increased cloud\nfraction, decreased cloud droplet radius, increased cloud reflectivity, increased cloud water content, and\nincreased cloud-top altitude. The highest clouds show a constant or decreasing ice cloud optical depth\nwith increased aerosol loading, suggesting stronger convection and the formation of higher towers with\nmore extensive (thinner) ice anvils. These correlations occur repeatedly, and independently of the type\nof cloud or type of aerosol, from fine (pollution, smoke) to coarse (sea salt, terrigenous dust), although\nwith different sensitivities.\n22\nFig. 15: Radiative forcing due to aerosols, showing the direct effects and indirect effects (via clouds).\nThese observations confirm that increased aerosol loading leads to increased CCN concentrations\nand, in turn, to clouds with a larger number of droplets, with a smaller mean size. This has important con-\nsequences on the \u201cindirect effects\u201d of aerosols on climate through their influence on radiative properties\n(Fig. 15). The first indirect effect is to increase the droplet surface area, making the cloud more reflective\n(known as the Twomey effect [151]). The second indirect effect is the inhibition of precipitation, which\nincreases the thickness of the cloud and its lifetime, and hence the cloud amount. For shallow clouds\nover the tropical and subtropical Atlantic Ocean, changes of the top-of-the-atmosphere radiative forcing\ndue to increased aerosol loading are found to be largely due to the increased cloud amount (80%), with\nsmaller contributions from the Twomey effect (10%) and increased liquid water path (10%) [148].\n3.3.2 Marine stratocumulus\nThe geographical regions that are most likely to be climatically sensitive to ion induced nucleation from\nGCRs are those where the existing CCN concentration is very low. For such regions, small variations\nin aerosol concentrations can induce large changes of cloud cover. Promising candidates are the vast\nregions of the eastern tropical and subtropical Pacific Oceans covered by marine stratocumulus clouds\n[152].\nIt is common for low clouds within the narrow marine boundary layer to self-organise into Rayleigh-\nBe\u00b4nard convective cells, limited on their upper edge by the temperature inversion. In the eastern sub-\ntropical oceans, more than 60% of all cloud scenes viewed in satellite images are classified as so-called\nmesoscale cellular convection [153]. (Ironically, Rayleigh-Be\u00b4nard convection is also responsible for the\nplasma granulation cells covering the solar photosphere.) The Rayleigh-Be\u00b4nard cells are probably ini-\ntiated by radiative cooling of the top of the cloud, together with entrainment of unsaturated air parcels\nfrom the free troposphere, causing a convective downdraft by evaporative cooling [154]. Drizzle from\nthe convective cells continually removes aerosols and may result in open cells in which only narrow\nclouds exist in the regions of convective updraft at the edges. The convective cells are only stable in\nnarrow boundary layer clouds of a few 100 m thickness since the Rayleigh number that characterises the\ncells\u2019 stability varies as the fourth power of the cloud thickness; for large values of this number there is\nturbulent mixing between the upward- and downward-going air parcels.\nA curious feature of regions where marine stratocumulus predominate is the appearance of large\npockets of almost cloud-free air (open cells) embedded in regions of otherwise homogeneous cloud field\n(closed cells) [155]. These open pockets are remarkably stable, lasting of order tens of hours. It suggests\nthat the cells have two relatively stable states: 1) closed cells in which vigorous Rayleigh-Be\u00b4nard convec-\n23\ntion is maintained by entrainment from the free troposphere, drawing in fresh CCN, and 2) open cells of\nweaker Rayleigh-Be\u00b4nard convection that prevents replenishment of CCN from the free troposphere and\nis therefore depleted of CCN. Open cells correspond to extreme CCN depletion; small increases in the\nCCN population can close these cells and induce a very large change in surface radiative energy balance\nfor the region concerned (increase of cloud coverage from about 50% to 100%). This picture is supported\nby observations of extremely light rainfall in the closed cell regions (<1% instantaneous frequency, and\nmostly evaporating before reaching the surface) and, on the other hand, heavy surface precipitation of\nabout 10 mm/day from the walls of the open cells [155]. The latter is highly significant since it is more\nthan twice the mean surface evaporation rate and, without replenishment, it would deplete the cloud of\nall its liquid water (and CCN) in tens of minutes. The existence of extremely low CCN concentrations in\nthe open cell regions is also supported by the presence of pronounced ship tracks due to the injection of\naerosols.\nFig. 16: Condensation nucleus (CN) concentration (10 nm diameter threshold) and shortwave radiation measured\nat sea surface level during the EPIC 2001 Stratocumulus Study in the south-east Pacific Ocean [146].\nDuring the EPIC 2001 Stratocumulus Study in the south-east Pacific Ocean, measurements were\nmade of the condensation nuclei (CN) concentration (10 nm diameter threshold) and shortwave radiation\n(SWR) at sea surface level (Fig. 16) [146]. A strong diurnal cycle was observed of fresh CN, driven by\nphotochemical processes, on a background of low night-time CN concentrations that correlate well with\ncloud droplet concentrations. Cloud droplet concentrations of 100 cm\u22123 or less in boundary layer clouds\nproduce substantial drizzle and CCN sedimentation [156]. Although unexplained at the time [146],\nthese daytime aerosol bursts are consistent with the nucleation and growth of H2SO4-H2O aerosols. The\nH2SO4 concentrations are too low during the nighttime for nucleation to occur; however, during the day,\nphotochemical production of OH radicals allows for the oxidation of di-methyl sulphide (DMS) to SO2,\nand then to H2SO4. Nevertheless, sufficient concentration of H2SO4 for nucleation and growth to occur\nis frequently only reached by the latter part of the day (Fig. 16). These are precisely the conditions under\nwhich ion induced nucleation could play a major role in determining the production rate of fresh aerosols\nand, by implication, the concentration of CCN and therefore cloud amount.\nThere is support for this picture from an earlier measurement of particle nucleation in the tropical\nboundary layer in which all of the key species, including OH, H2SO4, SO2 and DMS, were measured\n[157]. The observations unambiguously link aerosol nucleation and growth in the eastern tropical Pacific\nboundary layer to the marine sulphur cycle. Moreover, the measurements demonstrated that nucleation\nof H2SO4 particles is taking place at concentrations nearly an order of magnitude below those required\nby classical nucleation theory, which does not consider charge. On the other hand, the data were found\nto be well explained by a model of ion-induced nucleation [106].\n24\nFurther support for a possible GCR-cloud effect comes from satellite cloud data, which show a\nstrong solar cycle modulation of the radiative fluxes from low clouds in the southeastern Pacific Ocean\n[24]. This is attributed to the influence of increased GCR flux from the Southern Hemisphere Mag-\nnetic Anomaly (SHMA) [24]\u2014a large region of relatively low total geomagnetic field centred on South\nAmerica, around 30\u25e6S. However, it is the horizontal field that is responsible for GCR shielding, and this\ncomponent of the SHMA is centred much further to the east, near the tip of South Africa. On the other\nhand, the region of the southeastern Pacific Ocean dominated by mesoscale cellular convection [153]\ncoincides closely with the observed region of strong solar cycle modulation. An alternative and perhaps\nmore plausible explanation for the enhanced solar modulation is therefore that the region is especially\nclimatically sensitive to the effect of GCRs on new particle production\u2014which may influence the ratio\nof closed vs. open mesoscale convective cells. In summary, there is quite suggestive evidence that marine\nstratocumulus clouds in the tropics and sub-tropics are good candidates for further study of a possible\ncosmic ray influence.\n3.3.3 Lightning and climate\nA great deal has been learnt in recent years about global lightning activity and the global electrical circuit\nfrom satellite observations and measurements of natural (Schumann) resonances of the Earth-ionosphere\ncavity [158]. Lightning activity is an order of magnitude larger over land than over oceans, and it is\nconcentrated in the tropics, following the Sun\u2019s zenith with the seasons (Fig. 17). Charge separation\noccurs in the mixed-phase region of cumulonimbus clouds by collisions between large graupel particles\nand ice crystals (or small graupel particles or snow). The collisions transfer negative charge to the\nlarger particles, which then separate gravitationally to produce intense large-scale electric dipoles. These\nmay discharge to ground, carrying negative charge downwards and positive charge up to the ionosphere\n(Fig. 13).\nFig. 17: Global distribution of lightning flash rate (km\u22122y\u22121), April 1995\u2013February 2003, from the combined ob-\nservations of the NASA Optical Transient Detector (OTD) and Lightning Image Sensor (LIS) satellite instruments.\nThe pixel size is 0.5\u25e6\u00d70.5\u25e6.\nThe process of charge separation is very sensitive to cumulonimbus updraft speed. This is thought\nto account for the large contrast in lightning activity over land compared with the ocean. The land is\nmore readily heated by solar radiation than the ocean, which is mobile and has a higher heat capacity.\nAnother factor that produces more vigorous updraft speeds over land is the higher base height [158].\n25\nLarge lightning variations are observed of around 50\u2013100% for small temperature variations of only\n1\u25e6C. These have been observed on time scales from diurnal to that of the El-Nin\u02dco-Southern Oscillation,\nENSO (3\u20135 yr). Whether the strong link between lightning and global temperature persists on longer\ntime scales is an open question since the long-term convective re-adjustment of the atmosphere is not\nwell understood.\nIs there any link between lightning variability and GCR-cloud-climate effects? The answer is\nyes, perhaps, in two2 quite distinct areas: aerosol production and Milankovitch orbital cycles. In the\ncase of aerosol production, it has been proposed that the large contrast in land-ocean lightning activity\ncould be due to the increased aerosol concentrations over land [159]. This has the effect of producing\nsmaller droplets and suppressing coalescence and precipitation in the warm cloud base. In this way, a\nlarger amount of water reaches the mixed-phase region, allowing for more vigorous and abundant charge\nseparation. Indeed, the global distribution of lightning activity (Fig. 17) shows considerable similarities\nwith that of the aerosol optical depth measured by satellites. However, studies of lightning activity over\nthe Amazon [159] and over islands of sizes spanning ocean-like to continental-like rates [160, 161] do\nnot support the aerosol hypothesis\u2014although they are unable to rule it out.\nIn the second case, it is quite plausible that lightning activity may be modulated by the Mi-\nlankovitch orbital insolation cycles. This would imprint the orbital modulation frequencies on the global\nelectrical current and, in turn, on cloud cover, through the mechanisms described in \u00a73.1.3. Present low\nlatitude insolation is about 7% greater at perihelion (January) than aphelion (July). Precession cycles\nthis maximum through the seasons with a period of about 23 ky. Despite the lower insolation, lightning\nactivity is presently 10% larger in July than in January. This is attributed to the larger land area in the\nnorthern hemisphere compared with the southern hemisphere (Fig. 17). In 11.5 ky, perihelion will coin-\ncide with the northern hemisphere summer and this could lead to a large increase in lightning activity,\ngiven the highly non-linear processes involved. In short, the asymmetric land masses in the northern and\nsouthern hemispheres, combined with the large land-ocean contrast of lightning activity, could provide\na natural 23 ky periodicity on the ionospheric potential, Jz and cloud cover. The 41 ky cycle, due to\nchanges in obliquity of Earth\u2019s axis, would also be present in lightning activity\u2014for the same reason of\nthe north-south land mass asymmetry.\n3.3.4 Climate responses\nThere are several important general characteristics of a putative GCR-climate forcing. The first, which\nhas been described in detail, is that it can act on any time scale from days to hundreds of millions of years.\nIn particular, the GCR flux is a candidate for the presently-unknown forcing agent for centennial and mil-\nlennial scale variability. Another characteristic is that a change of GCR flux acts globally and, moreover,\nwith the same phase everywhere. Satellite data suggest that increased GCR flux is associated with in-\ncreased low clouds, which globally exert a net radiative cooling effect\u2014although a warming effect in\npolar regions, where clear-sky insolation is low. A global forcing mechanism avoids the frequent puzzle\nof an observed synchronicity among climate transitions reconstructed at widely separated geographical\nlocations, without any clear mechanism for their teleconnection. Orbital modulation of solar insolation\nalso acts globally, but with an opposite phase in the two hemispheres, such that the net change of insola-\ntion is close to zero. In contrast, a GCR-cloud forcing would cause a non-zero net insolation change, and\nso a relatively small GCR forcing over a long period has the potential to exert a strong climatic response.\nIt is also important to note that, prior to industrialisation, the prevailing aerosol concentrations over most\nof the troposphere\u2014including over land masses\u2014may have been very low, and similar to present-day\npristine marine environments (<\u223c100 CCN/cm3) [162]. Under these conditions, cosmic rays may have\nhad the potential to affect clouds over a larger region of the globe than today. Finally, GCR forcing of\nclouds would produce a rapid effect\u2014of order one day\u2014so all subsequent climatic responses would be\n2We do not include here the contribution of cosmic ray showers as the likely trigger for lightning, by injecting MeV-energy\nelectrons into electrified clouds, which can then avalanche and lead to runaway breakdown.\n26\nobserved either to be simultaneous with a GCR flux change or else to lag by their characteristic response\ntime.\nAt present clouds are considered solely to be part of the response of the climate system to other\nchanges, such as an increase in temperature or humidity. However, if a significant GCR-cloud interaction\nexists, this would introduce a new role for clouds as a primary driver of climate change. We can consider\nhow this would influence climate (Fig. 18). Via some mechanism\u2014such as ion-induced nucleation of\nH2SO4 vapour\u2014the GCR flux is assumed to modulate the concentration of CCN and thereby cloud\namount, reflectivity and precipitation. Increased GCR flux implies increased CCN concentrations, longer\ncloud lifetimes and higher albedo, resulting in lower insolation and more efficient long-range transport of\nmoisture. GCR-driven variations of clouds and insolation would in turn cause feedback responses from a\nwide range of climatic variables which would mostly amplify the climate transition. The most important\nresponses may include the following: 1) land and sea surface temperatures and temperature contrasts,\nwhich will affect wind and monsoon intensity, 2) moisture transport efficiency, which will affect long-\nwave absorption, the availability of water vapour for clouds and the ice sheet extent during the dry glacial\nperiods, 3), aridity and vegetation, which will affect the dust supply and, in turn, phytoplankton activity,\nand therefore atmospheric concentrations of CO2.\nFig. 18: Potential responses of the climate system to forcing from galactic cosmic rays, assuming they influence\ncloud cover and droplet number concentration. This would affect both insolation and the hydrological cycle which,\nin turn, may produce a wide range of climate responses, as indicated.\nWe may speculate how the GCR flux could affect the ITCZ migration and monsoon intensity. The\nmonsoon system appears to be sensitive to quite small insolation changes, since monsoons around the\nentire tropics seem to have intensified and weakened over the last 50 years in step with the 11-year solar\ncycle [163]. The sign of the effect is the same as that observed in the palaeoclimatic reconstructions,\nnamely a decreased GCR intensity is associated with a strengthening of the monsoon (increased rain-\n27\nfall). Anomalies in the seasonal migration of the ITCZ can occur due to shifts in the north-south gradient\nof ocean surface temperatures near the equator [164]. Following the earlier discussion, the mesoscale\nconvective cells in subtropical stratocumulus clouds may be especially sensitive to ion induced nucle-\nation, and so any north-south asymmetry of these clouds could produce a corresponding ocean surface\ntemperature gradient that depends on the GCR flux. The ocean temperature gradient can, in turn, drive\na low-level atmospheric circulation that may strengthen the trade winds in, for example, the south and\nweaken them in the north. The result is to impede the southward migration of the ITCZ, increasing\nnorthern tropical rainfall and reducing southern tropical rainfall. This condition would persist for the\nduration of the forcing anomaly which, for GCRs, may last several centuries or more.\nAmong the consequences of GCR-induced effects on the hydrological cycle and wind strength,\npotential changes in dust production and transport may be especially important for glacial-interglacial\nclimate differences. The GISP2 Greenland ice core has provided evidence of solar/GCR forcing of the\ndust flux during the last glacial period, to at least 100 ky ago: measurements of the dust concentration in\nsix core sections, each representing 1\u20132 ky, have revealed distinct 11 y and 22 y modulations, characteris-\ntic of the solar cycle [165]. Increased GCR flux would increase CCN concentrations and cloud lifetimes,\nproducing decreased rainout frequency and therefore increased aridity and dust production and, in ad-\ndition, an increased efficiency for transporting water evaporated from the oceans, deep into continental\nregions. Since terrigenous dust is the major source of iron for the sea surface, its availability controls\nphytoplankton activity in so-called HNLC (high nutrient low chlorophyll) polar ocean regions. Therefore\ndust-supply strongly influences DMS (di-methyl sulphide) production by phytoplankton; up to eight-fold\nincreases in DMS concentrations have been seen in iron-addition experiments [166]. Di-methyl sulphide\nis oxidised to SO2 and then to H2SO4 by the hydroxyl radical, OH. The hydroxyl radical is generated by\nsolar ultra violet radiation [167]. Higher insolation also stimulates phytoplankton activity and therefore\nraises DMS production. As a result, in regions where ion induced nucleation may be important for CCN\nproduction, increased insolation may, paradoxically, result in reduced sea surface temperatures if the in-\ncreased cloud cover overwhelms the increase of shortwave radiation. This is a possible interpretation of\nthe interesting observation that the strong 41-ky obliquity signal in the eastern equatorial Pacific ocean\nsurface temperatures between 1.8 and 1.2 My ago varied in the opposite sense to local annual insolation\n[168].\n4 CLOUD FACILITY AT CERN\n4.1 Overview\nThe key to further progress on the cosmic ray-cloud-climate question is to understand the nature of the\nphysical mechanism. This requires a thorough experimental study of the fundamental microphysical\ninteractions between cosmic rays and clouds. Given the many sources of variability in the atmosphere\u2014\nand the lack of any control of the GCR flux\u2014demonstrating and explaining overall cause and effect\nbeginning with changes in ionisation rate and ending with observations of perturbed clouds will be quite\nchallenging. For this reason, an experimental facility known as CLOUD (Cosmics Leaving OUtdoor\nDroplets) is being set up at CERN to investigate GCR-cloud microphysics under controlled conditions\nin the laboratory [169, 170].\nThe experiment involves a 4 m diameter aerosol chamber and a 0.5 m cloud chamber (Fig. 19)\nwhich are exposed to a CERN particle beam, providing an adjustable source of \u201ccosmic rays\u201d that closely\nsimulates GCRs at any altitude or latitude. The chambers are filled with ultra-pure air, water vapour\nand selected trace gases and aerosols, and can be operated at any temperature or pressure found in\nthe atmosphere. In view of the highly non-linear nature of the processes under study, all experimental\nparameters (cosmic ray intensity, trace gas concentrations, temperature, pressure, etc.) will duplicate\natmospheric conditions. Since the trace gas concentrations may be as low as parts-per-trillion, extremely\ncareful attention is required for the preparation of the inner surfaces of the chambers and for the design\nof the gas supply system. Each chamber is equipped with UV illumination (for photolytic reactions) and\n28\nFig. 19: Perspective view of the CLOUD facility at CERN, showing the 4 m aerosol chamber and 0.5m cloud\nchamber. The aerosol chamber is surrounded by instruments that sample and analyse its contents. The particle\nbeam emerges from the dipole magnet at the lower left of the drawing and then traverses a beam counter array and\nthe chambers. The entire experimental area is surrounded by concrete and steel radiation shielding blocks.\nan electric field cage to control the drift of small ions and charged aerosols. During beam exposure, the\ncontents of the chambers are continuously analysed by a wide range of sensitive instruments connected\nto the chambers via sampling probes, optical ports and electrical feed-throughs.\nThe CLOUD facility is presently in its design and prototyping phase. A prototype 3 m aerosol\nchamber\u2014limited to operation at room temperature and 1 atmosphere pressure\u2014will start operation at\nthe beginning of 2009. The final 4 m aerosol chamber, operating at any temperature or pressure, is\nexpected to start in 2011.\n4.2 Experimental goals\nThe essential experimental goal of CLOUD is to carry out definitive laboratory measurements of the\nfundamental physical and chemical processes through which cosmic rays may affect the number of cloud\ndroplets or ice particles. Where effects are found in the experimental data, they will first be evaluated with\ncloud models and, if climatically significant, parametrised for inclusion in General Circulation Models\n(GCMs). The CLOUD facility is designed to have sufficient flexibility to make a broad experimental\nsurvey of this poorly-known field. A series of experiments will be carried out over a period of several\nyears to investigate the influence of cosmic rays on a) aerosol nucleation and growth (\u00a73.1.2), and b)\ncloud microphysics such as ice particle formation and collision efficiencies between aerosol particles\nand cloud droplets (\u00a73.1.3). The main experiments are outlined below.\n29\n4.2.1 Aerosol nucleation and growth experiments\nIon-induced nucleation: The effect of ionising particle radiation on the formation rate of ultrafine\ncondensation nuclei (few-nm size range) from trace precursor vapours will be measured. The trace gases\ninclude, in particular, H2SO4, HNO3, NH3 and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), all in the presence\nof H2O vapour. The basic parameter to be measured is the nucleation rate, J (cm\u22123s\u22121), as a function\nof the primary experimental variables: trace vapour types and concentrations, temperature, background\naerosol concentration, ion-pair production rate and aerosol charge sign. Measurements will also be taken\nwith electric fields of up to 20 kV/m in the chamber. This sweeps all small ions out of the chamber\nin about one second, effectively \u201cswitching off\u201d all ionisation, including that due to natural GCRs. A\ntypical run under fixed conditions will last several hours, after which the contents of the chamber will be\nreplaced and the run conditions\u2014such as particle beam intensity\u2014adjusted in preparation for a new run.\nGrowth of CN into CCN: The effect of cosmic rays on the growth of CN into CCN (i.e. from \u223c5 nm\ndiameter to \u223c100 nm) will be measured in the presence of condensable vapours that are known to be\nimportant for aerosol growth in the atmosphere, in particular VOCs. The main parameter to be measured\nat the end of each run is the CCN concentration as a function of water vapour saturation. Prior to\noperation of the 0.5 m cloud chamber, the CCN measurements will be made with a small sampling\nexpansion chamber. The fraction of the CN that constitute CCN depends not only on their size but also\non their chemical composition and other properties. The evolution of the CN size spectra during beam\nexposure will also be measured. As before, a series of runs will be performed to take measurements as\na function of the primary experimental variables: trace vapour types and concentrations, temperature,\nbackground aerosol concentration and ion-pair production rate. A typical single run may last up to about\n1 day, reflecting the relatively slow growth times involved. This is the primary reason for the large size\nof the aerosol chamber, both to minimise the wall losses of trace vapours and aerosols, and to provide a\nlarge parent volume for the external sampling analysers.\nActivation of CCN into cloud droplets: The goal of these experiments is to see how the presence of\nelectrical charge affects the critical supersaturations required to activate CCN, and also how it affects\nthe number of cloud droplets that appear. Well-defined aerosol sizes will be produced with standard\naerosol generation techniques. The simplest systems will involve typical hygroscopic aerosols found in\nthe atmosphere, e.g. NaCl, (NH4)2SO4 and H2SO4, and also partially soluble aerosols such as CaSO4.\nOther measurements will be made on hydrophobic carbonaceous particles, with and without the presence\nof organic surfactants.\n4.2.2 Cloud microphysics experiments\nIce particle formation: These experiments will study the effect of highly-charged aerosols (>\u223c100 e)\non the formation of ice particles in clouds. A well-defined polydisperse distribution of CCN will first\nbe introduced into the chamber, together with a small population (10\u22124\u201310\u22126 relative to the CCN) of\nefficient ice nuclei such as AgI or ice-nucleating bacteria. The CCN will be exposed to a unipolar space\ncharge in the chamber\u2014created by the particle beam and a \u201cvalley\u201d electric potential configuration for\nthe field cage\u2014to create a highly-charged aerosol population. A supercooled cloud at temperatures\nbetween 0\u25e6C and -40\u25e6C will then be created by an adiabatic pressure reduction in the chamber, followed\nby growth of droplets. The temperature of the droplets can be controlled by the initial temperature of the\nchamber and by the pressure drop. In the aerosol chamber, this will be achieved by opening the chamber\nto a small semi-evacuated auxiliary chamber; in the cloud chamber, by a piston expansion. After forming\nthe cloud of supercooled droplets, the production of ice particles will be measured via both optical ports\nand sampling instruments. The presence of an ice crystal in a cloud of liquid droplets is readily identified\nby the CCD cameras since an ice crystal scatters much more light than a liquid droplet. The ice fraction\n30\nwill also be measured with a backscattered polarised laser beam. The experiments will be repeated for\nvarious initial charge states of the aerosols in order to determine the influence of charge on the production\nof ice particles by contact nucleation.\nCollision efficiencies of aerosols and droplets: These experiments will study the effect of highly-\ncharged aerosols and cloud droplets on collision efficiencies in clouds. As before, a well-defined poly-\ndisperse distribution of CN and CCN will be introduced into the chamber, and then exposed to the\nparticle beam and a unipolar space charge, creating a distribution of highly charged aerosols. The CCN\npopulation will then be activated into a polydisperse distribution of cloud droplets and the coalescence\nefficiencies of droplets with aerosols measured. The latter will involve both direct sampling measure-\nments and also re-compression of the chamber to evaporate the droplets and re-measure the CN and CCN\nspectra after cloud processing.\nFreezing mechanism of polar stratospheric clouds: These experiments will investigate the depo-\nsition freezing nucleation of HNO3 and water vapours onto ion clusters, forming nitric acid hydrates.\nParticles composed of such hydrates are the principal component of the polar stratospheric clouds that\ninitiate the destruction of ozone. The operating temperatures are typical polar stratospheric values of\nbetween 190 and 200 K. Nitric acid and water vapour will be present in the chamber at partial pressures\nrepresentative of the stratosphere (10\u22124 Pa for HNO3 vapour and 5 \u00b7 10\u22122 Pa for H2O vapour, corre-\nsponding to about 10 ppb and 5 ppm, respectively). At these pressures and temperatures the nitric acid\nhydrates become supersaturated and can condense as crystals provided a suitable ice nucleus is present.\nSulphuric acid vapour will be included in the air mixture to represent the species most likely to contribute\nto the initial ion cluster formation.\n5 CONCLUSIONS\nNumerous palaeoclimatic observations, covering a wide range of time scales, suggest that galactic cosmic\nray variability is associated with climate change. The quality and diversity of the observations make it\ndifficult to dismiss them merely as chance associations. But is the GCR flux directly affecting the climate\nor merely acting as a proxy for variations of the solar irradiance or a spectral component such as UV?\nHere, there is some palaeoclimatic evidence for associations of the climate with geomagnetic and galactic\nmodulations of the GCR flux, which, if confirmed, point to a direct GCR-climate forcing. Moreover,\nnumerous studies have reported meteorological responses to short-term changes of cosmic rays or the\nglobal electrical current, which are unambiguously associated with ionising particle radiation.\nCosmic ray forcing of the climate could in principle operate on all time scales from days to hun-\ndreds of millions of years, reflecting the characteristic time scales for changes in the Sun\u2019s magnetic\nactivity, Earth\u2019s magnetic field, and the galactic environment of the solar system. Moreover the climate\nforcing would act simultaneously, and with the same sign, across the globe. This would both allow a\nlarge climatic response from a relatively small forcing and also give rise to simultaneous regional cli-\nmate responses without any clear teleconnection path. The most persuasive palaeoclimatic evidence for\nsolar/GCR forcing involves sub-orbital (centennial and millennial) climate variability over the Holocene,\nfor which there is no established forcing agent at present. Increased GCR flux appears to be associated\nwith a cooler climate, a southerly shift of the ITCZ (Inter Tropical Convergence Zone) and a weakening\nof the monsoon; and decreased GCR flux is associated with a warmer climate, a northerly shift of the\nITCZ and a strengthening of the monsoon (increased rainfall). The influence on the ITCZ may imply sig-\nnificant changes of upper tropospheric water vapour in the tropics and sub-tropics, potentially affecting\nboth long-wave absorption and the availability of water vapour for cirrus clouds.\nThe most likely mechanism for a putative GCR-climate forcing is an influence of ionisation on\nclouds, as suggested by satellite observations and supported by theoretical and modelling studies. The\n31\nsatellite data suggest that decreased GCR flux is associated with decreased low altitude clouds, which\nare known to exert globally a net radiative cooling effect. Studies of Forbush decreases and solar proton\nevents further suggest that decreased GCR flux may reduce high altitude (polar stratospheric) clouds in\nthe Antarctic. Candidate microphysical processes include ion-induced nucleation of new aerosols from\ntrace condensable vapours, and the formation of relatively highly charged aerosols and cloud droplets\nat cloud boundaries, which may enhance the formation of ice particles in clouds and affect the collision\nefficiencies of aerosols with cloud droplets. Although recent observations support the presence of ion-\ninduced nucleation of new aerosols in the atmosphere, the possible contribution of such new particles to\nchanges in the number of cloud condensation nuclei remains an open question. Furthermore, the parts of\nthe globe and atmosphere that would be expected to be the most climatically sensitive to such processes\nare unknown, although they are likely to involve regions of low existing CCN concentrations.\nDespite these uncertainties, the question of whether, and to what extent, the climate is influenced\nby solar and cosmic ray variability remains central to our understanding of the anthropogenic contribution\nto present climate change. Real progress on the cosmic ray-climate question will require a physical\nmechanism to be established, or else ruled out. With new experiments planned or underway, such as the\nCLOUD facility at CERN, there are good prospects that we will have some firm answers to this question\nwithin the next few years.\nAcknowledgements: I warmly thank my colleagues in the CLOUD collaboration for many stimulating\ndiscussions.

Important steps have been taken to decompose the climatic\ndrivers of vector-borne2 and waterborne diseases3,4, and to\ndevelop projections for the future burden and geographical range\nof pathogens across climate change scenarios5. Less attention has\nbeen paid to directly-transmitted infections, despite key work on\ninfluenza demonstrating the significant role climatic variables can\nplay in driving the transmission of these types of infections.\nExperimental studies show that influenza transmission increases\nin conditions of low humidity6\u20138. Observational studies in tem-\nperate climates support this finding; while in tropical locations,\ninfluenza peaks have been observed to occur in the rainy season\nwhen humidity increases9,10. The rapid evolution of the seasonal\ninfluenza virus and the consequent complexity of dynamics\nmakes projections of future epidemics difficult11,12. In contrast,\nmany major childhood infections exhibit more regular dynamics,\nmaking the long-term consequences of environmental drivers\neasier to dissect13\u201316.\nRespiratory syncytial virus infects most children before the age\nof two and is a leading cause of lower respiratory tract infections\nin infants, particularly bronchiolitis and pneumonia, and has also\nbeen implicated in the later life development of asthma17,18.\nRecent estimates suggest that RSV is responsible for ~5.2% of\nunder-five deaths globally19, though the proportion may be even\nhigher for younger age groups experiencing their first\ninfection20,21. RSV epidemics exhibit distinct seasonal cycles22,\nwith the peak occurring around the winter months in temperate\nlocations and closer to the rainy season in tropical, more humid\nlocations23\u201325, as has been noted for influenza9,26. Recent work by\nPitzer et al., using state-level data from the United States, showed\nbroad-scale correlations between several annually-averaged cli-\nmate variables and the amplitude of the periodic forcing of the\nmodeled RSV cycle, suggesting that climate may play a crucial\nrole in driving epidemics27. However, the results did not address\nthe distinct seasonality of RSV in tropical locations, nor the\nearlier timing of epidemic onset in Florida. Higher resolution data\nover a wider spatial scale is required to disentangle the specific\nclimatic drivers governing the dynamics and timing of RSV\nepidemics and to unite predictions for both temperate and tro-\npical locations.\nHere, we leverage a county-level dataset of weekly RSV hos-\npitalizations from over 300 locations in the United States and\ncombine these observations with weekly bronchiolitis hospitali-\nzation data from all 32 states in Mexico. The temporal range of\nour dataset spans 5\u201315 years depending on location (Fig. 1a). The\nspatial extent of our dataset covers a diverse set of climatologies\nincluding tropical, humid locations in southern Mexico and\ntemperate climates in the US, where locations in northern lati-\ntudes experience large seasonal variation in climate conditions\n(Supplementary Fig. 1 and 2). We combine our RSV case data\nwith high resolution climate data (precipitation, specific humid-\nity, and temperature) in order to investigate spatial patterns in\ndynamics, evaluate the drivers of transmission, and project future\nRSV cycles under climate change scenarios.\nResults\nCurrent climate. Spatial order is observed in the timing of onset\nof the RSV epidemic and the dynamic patterns of incidence\n(Fig. 1b, e). Mid-western and northern counties in the United\nStates have biennial cycles which alternate between high and low\nincidence years (Fig. 1c)27. Coastal and southern US locations\nexhibit annual cycles of incidence where cases peak seasonally\nand then disappear in the off-season. Counties in Florida and\nmost Mexican states also experience annual cycles of incidence,\nalthough the epidemic in these locations persists throughout the\nyear resulting in a shallow-trough cycle. The earliest onset of the\nepidemic occurs in the summer months simultaneously in Miami,\nFlorida, and the Yucatan peninsula in Mexico. Onset timing then\nfollows a latitudinal gradient northward such that onset occurs\nlast in the northern US in late December (Fig. 1b, Supplementary\nFig. 5). The timing of school semesters is unlikely to drive this\ngradient: while US school start dates vary by state, in Mexico the\nfirst day of the school year is more broadly standardized across\nthe country28.\nWe find that timing of onset is correlated with mean local\nclimate (Fig. 1d). There is no animal model for RSV so we rely on\nmechanistic understanding developed from influenza experi-\nments to inform our choice of climate variables (Supplementary\nNote 1). Therefore we begin our analysis by considering specific\nhumidity and include precipitation because of its observed\nimportance in tropical locations9,23\u201326. We also test for effects\nof temperature as a fundamental meteorological variable (though\nit is functionally related to specific humidity: Supplementary\nNote 1). Specific humidity, precipitation, and temperature are\nsignificantly (p \u0001 0:001) associated with the mean timing of\nonset of the RSV epidemic, with specific humidity explaining 52%\nof the variance in mean onset timing across locations. Southern\nFlorida and the Yucatan peninsula, where the outbreak starts, are\nthe most humid regions in the dataset. To investigate whether\nyear-to-year variations in humidity can alter the timing of onset\nof the epidemic within a particular location, we calculate the\nonset week for every year for each location in our dataset, and fit\na regression model including dummies for each location to\nremove mean onset timing. We find that a 1 (g/kg) increase in\nmean annual specific humidity shifts the timing of the RSV\nepidemic back by 1 week (p \u0001 0:001). Similar effects are shown\nfor both temperature (0.3 week/\u00b0C) and average precipitation\n(0.5 week/mm) (Supplementary Table 1).\nWhile these spatial level correlations are striking, it is\nnecessary to characterize the climate drivers of transmission in\norder to model possible future changes to RSV dynamics. We\ncalculate an empirical transmission rate based on the discrete\ntime version of the susceptible\u2013infected\u2013recovered (TSIR) model\nusing Em\u03b2t \u00bc It\u00fe1NtI\u03b1t St , assuming we can approximate the first RSV\ninfection as immunizing given that secondary infections are less\nsevere and less infectious29,30. Here we observe It , It\u00fe1, and Nt\ndirectly from our data where I is incidence, N is population and t\nis the generation time of RSV, approximated as 1 week27. \u03b1\ncaptures heterogeneities in mixing and the effects of discretiza-\ntion. In order to estimate S, the number of susceptibles, which is\nnot directly observed within our dataset, we fit the TSIR model to\neach location and extract the time series of susceptibles from the\nmean model fit.\nThe constructed dataset of empirical transmission rates is\nincluded in a panel regression model, where log transmission is\nthe dependent variable and climate variables are the independent\nvariables. Our main regression specification includes a suite of\ncontrols: specifically, county-by-month dummies to remove\npotential confounding from location-specific seasonal aggregation\nsuch as school semesters, and county-by-year dummies to remove\nconfounding from location-specific episodic events. As in the\ndescriptive analysis, we include both precipitation and specific\nhumidity in our baseline regression model. Results for tempera-\nture are included in Supplementary Fig. 10 and mirror an expected\nlogarithmic functional transformation of the humidity result.\nWe find a significant effect (p \u0001 0:001) of both precipitation\nand specific humidity on RSV transmission (Fig. 2a, Supplementary\nARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-13562-y\n2 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS |         (2019) 10:5512 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-13562-y | www.nature.com/naturecommunications\n0 2000 4000\n0.0\n0.4\n0.8\n \nCo\nrre\nla\ntio\nn\nDistance (km)\n2000 2005 2010\n0.0\n0.6\nDenver County, CO\nIn\nci\nde\nnc\ne\n1998 2002 2006 2010\n0.0\n0.6\nNew York County, NY\nIn\nci\nde\nnc\ne\n1998 2002 2006 2010\n0.0\n0.6\nBroward County, FL\nIn\nci\nde\nnc\ne\n2000 2004 2008 2012\n0.0\n0.6\nVeracruz State, MEX\nIn\nci\nde\nnc\ne\nShape\nBiennial\nAnnual\nShallow\nOnset week\n2 6 10 14 18 22 26 30\n5 10 15 20 25\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n \nO\nns\net\n w\ne\ne\nk\nTemperature (C) \nR2 = 0.48 R2 = 0.52 R2 = 0.48 \n4 6 8 10 12 14 16\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n \nO\nns\net\n w\ne\ne\nk\nSpecific humidity (g/kg)\n \n0 1 2 3 4\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n \nO\nns\net\n w\ne\ne\nk\nPrecipitation (mm)\n \nCo\nun\ntie\ns/\nst\nat\nes\n o\nrd\ner\ned\n b\ny \nla\ntit\nud\ne\n2000 2005 2010\nTime\n0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00\nIncidence\nba\nc\ned\nFig. 1 Broad-scale patterns of RSV are correlated with local climate. a Incidence time series for each county (USA) and state (Mexico) in the dataset.\nb Timing of onset (color) and dynamic pattern (shape) of each location in the dataset. c Example incidence time series for four location exhibiting distinct\ndynamic patterns. d Correlation between timing of epidemic onset and mean climate conditions (averages over temporal range of data). e Spatial\ncorrelation between RSV time series.\nShape\nBiennial\nAnnual\nShallow\nMedian\n75thQ\n25thQ\nMin\nMax\n0\n3\n6\n9\n12\na b\nc\ne\n5 10 15 20\nSpecific humidity\nPr\nec\nip\nita\ntio\nn\n0.00\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\n0.20\n0.25\nLog\ntransmission\nHennepin County, MN Kings County, NY Miami-Dade County, FL Sinaloa State, MEX\n25 50 75 100\nWeek (two year)\nN\nor\nm\na\nliz\ne\nd \nin\nci\nde\nnc\ne\n0.00\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\nLo\ng \ntra\nn\nsm\nis\nsi\non\nch\nan\nge\n0 5 10 15 20\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nN\nor\nm\na\nliz\ne\nd \nin\ncid\nen\nce\nSpecific humidity\n0 5 10 15 20\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n11\n12\n1\n23 4 5 6\n7\n8\n9\n10\nN\nor\nm\na\nliz\ne\nd \nin\ncid\nen\nce\nSpecific humidity\n0 5 10 15 20\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\n12\n1\n23\n4\n5\n6\n7 8\n9\n10\n11\nN\nor\nm\na\nliz\ne\nd \nin\ncid\nen\nce\nSpecific humidity\n0 5 10 15 20\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nN\nor\nm\na\nliz\ne\nd \nin\ncid\nen\nce\nSpecific humidity\nMN\nNY\nFL\nMEX\n2\n3\n4\n5 6 78910\n11\n12\n1\nMonth, pre-peak\nMonth, post-peak\n1\n2\n3\n4 5 6 78\n9\n10\n11\n12\nd\n1\n4 5\n6\n7\n11\n89\n10\n0\n3\n6\n9\n12\n5 10 15 20\nSpecific humidity\nPr\nec\nip\nita\ntio\nn\n1\n4\n5\n6\n7\n10\n1112\n0\n3\n6\n9\n12\n5 10 15 20\nSpecific humidity\nPr\nec\nip\nita\ntio\nn\n1\n3\n5\n6\n7\n10\n2\n9\n11\n0\n3\n6\n9\n12\n5 10 15 20\nSpecific humidity\nPr\nec\nip\nita\ntio\nn\n1\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n3 11120\n3\n6\n9\n12\n5 10 15 20\nSpecific humidity\nPr\nec\nip\nita\ntio\nn\n2010\nHennepin County, MN Kings County, NY Miami-Dade County, FL Sinaloa State, MEX\n1 6\n7\n8\n10\n11\n10\n0\n3\n6\n9\n12\n5 15 20\nSpecific humidity\nPr\nec\nip\nita\ntio\nn\n2100\n1\n3 4\n5\n6\n7\n9\n2 11\n0\n3\n6\n9\n12\n5 10 15 20\nSpecific humidity\nPr\nec\nip\nita\ntio\nn\n1\n3\n4 5 6\n7\n810\n11\n0\n3\n6\n9\n12\n5 10 15 20\nSpecific humidity\nPr\nec\nip\nita\ntio\nn\n1\n4\n5\n6\n7\n10\n11\n0\n3\n6\n9\n12\n5 10 15 20\nSpecific humidity\nPr\nec\nip\nita\ntio\nn\nFig. 2 Specific humidity and precipitation drive RSV transmission. a Model results for the predicted effect of specific humidity and precipitation on\ntransmission. b Normalized monthly RSV cases before peak incidence (gray) and after peak incidence (yellow) against mean monthly humidity for four\nlocations in the dataset, month-of-year shown in point. c Mean incidence averaged biennially for the same four locations demonstrating distinct dynamic\npatterns. d Seasonal trajectory in terms of humidity and precipitation for same locations in 2010 and 2100, month-of-year shown in point. e Boxplot\nshowing seasonal change in transmission grouped by dynamic pattern.\nNATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-13562-y ARTICLE\nNATURE COMMUNICATIONS |         (2019) 10:5512 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-13562-y | www.nature.com/naturecommunications 3\nTable 2). Fitting a flexible nonparametric model reveals that\nhumidity follows an inverse relationship with log transmis-\nsion (Supplementary Fig. 8 and 9). Peak transmission occurs in\nvery dry conditions and drops sharply as humidity increases. In\ncontrast, we find a positive linear effect of rainfall on transmission.\nOur combined results imply that the humidity effect will dominate\nin locations that experience very low humidity at certain times of\nyear, while rainfall will become a key driver in locations where\nhumidity is on average higher or varies minimally over the year,\nsuch as in tropical climates.\nWe consider the implications of our estimated climate effect\nfor four locations in our dataset with exemplar dynamic patterns\nand timing of epidemic onset (Fig. 2b, c). In Fig. 2d we show the\nseasonal trajectories for these locations, with the mean monthly\nrainfall and humidity overlaid on our predicted transmission\neffect. Hennepin County, MN, an example of a location with\nbiennial outbreaks, has large changes in predicted transmission\nover the course of the year, with maximum transmission in the\nwinter months (Fig. 2c) when peak incidence also occurs (Fig. 2b).\nKings County, NY, an example of a location with annual\noutbreaks, has a wintertime peak in predicted transmission driven\nby declining humidity, though not to the same extent as the\nbiennial test case. In contrast, our model predicts that Miami-\nDade County, FL, an example of a shallow-trough location,\nexperiences peak transmission in the summer months driven by\nsummertime rainfall. The dominance of the rainfall effect means\nthat Miami experiences an increase in cases even as humidity\nincreases, a reversal of the patterns observed over most US\ncounties (Fig. 2b), which explains the early onset of the epidemic\nin this location.\nMany Mexican states show a similar result to Miami. However,\nfor some states such as Sinaloa our model predicts two optimal\ntimes for transmission within a year, one driven by low humidity\nand the other driven by increasing rainfall. These two peaks are\nvisible in the Sinaloa incidence time series (Fig. 1c). While such\npatterns have been previously observed in both RSV and\ninfluenza time series in tropical countries9,23, our results provide\nevidence for the climatic variation driving these observed\ndynamics. Across the dataset we find that locations with biennial\ndynamics experienced larger seasonal changes in predicted\ntransmission than locations with shallow-trough dynamics\n(Fig. 2e) as suggested by earlier work27.\nFuture climate. In our historical analysis we made the con-\nservative assumption of removing local seasonal variation and\nlocal year-to-year mean variation with the inclusion of dummy\nvariables, essentially looking at the effect of climate anomalies on\ntransmission. These dummy variables subsume both annual cli-\nmate variations and social drivers of transmission. In future\nprojections we refit the model without these dummy variables to\nexplore the maximum likely effect of climate on future trans-\nmission (Supplementary Fig. 12, using a common seasonal effect\nacross locations to capture schooling generates similar results:\nSupplementary Fig. 14). We run simulations varying the mean\ntransmission rate and the amplitude of the seasonal change in\ntransmission, holding birth rates and population constant (Fig. 3a\nleft). As the amplitude increases, cycles tend to become more\nbiennial and eventually chaotic31,32. Figure 3a (right) shows the\ntrajectory of each county in terms of current to future predicted\ncycle dynamics, where the future is the end-of-century Coupled\nModel Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) multi-model-\nmean climate, based on the Representative Concentration Path-\nway 8.5 (RCP8.5) scenario33. We find that increases to specific\nhumidity, driven by higher temperatures, result in reduced\ntransmission and a lower amplitude of seasonal transmission,\nwith locations in our dataset no longer experiencing the very dry\nconditions that drive larger seasonal transmission changes. This\nresults in cycles becoming more annual and shallower on average:\na northward latitudinal shift in the types of dynamic patterns\nobserved.\nWhile individual CMIP5 models are consistent in projecting\nincreasing surface air temperature and hence specific humidity,\nthere is significant disagreement across models with regard to\nfuture changes to regional precipitation34. Given that precipita-\ntion is found to be an important driver of RSV, particularly in\ntropical locations, we explore the implications of the model range\nin precipitation projections for future RSV epidemic dynamics. In\nFig. 3b we show simulations of the RSV cycle for three locations\nin Mexico where transmission is driven by humidity, fixed at the\n2100 CMIP5 multi-model-mean and precipitation, based on\ntrajectories from all 23 CMIP5 models (three models did not\ninclude explicit precipitation projections and are removed). The\nupper 90th percentile, the 50th percentile, and the lower 10th\npercentile, in terms of the amplitude of RSV transmission\npredicted by the model, are highlighted within the figure.\nThe uncertainty in the size of simulated epidemics depends on\nthe relative role of precipitation in driving the transmission cycle\nin a particular location. For instance, the seasonal cycle of RSV in\nSonora is mostly driven by changes to humidity (Supplementary\nFig. 11), meaning that deviations from mean precipitation do not\nalter cycle dynamics. However, in Oaxaca, where humidity\nremains constant throughout the year, differences in future\nrainfall across CMIP5 models result in divergent cycle dynamics.\nHigh precipitation results in a bifurcation, leading to biennial\noutbreak cycles.\nWe evaluate the CMIP5 model uncertainty by calculating\ndifferences between individual 2100 model projections and 2010\nestimates of the seasonal change in transmission across all\nlocations in the dataset (Fig. 3c). For many locations in the\nUnited States, model differences in rainfall projections do not\nalter the mean decline in seasonal transmission change. In these\nlocations the RSV cycle is driven primarily by changes to\nhumidity. However, for Mexico, Florida, and coastal parts of the\nwestern US, there is a large divergence across models and extreme\nrainfall increases the seasonal transmission change in multiple\nscenarios. In these locations, the future dynamics of RSV will\nhinge on future rainfall, and reducing uncertainty across climate\nmodels will help better predict and prepare for potential changes\nto RSV epidemic intensity.\nDiscussion\nOur model unites predictions for the climate drivers of RSV across\nboth temperate and tropical locations, finding that the effect of\nlow humidity trades off against rainfall drivers, depending on\nlocation. The striking similarity in the role of specific humidity for\nboth influenza and RSV suggests that parallel mechanisms are at\nplay for the two viruses (Fig. 4); however, the lack of an animal\nmodel for RSV means experimental work cannot currently be used\nto support our findings. This correspondence appears to hold even\nthough the population dynamics of influenza and RSV are palp-\nably different. Influenza disappears at high latitudes in the sum-\nmer whereas RSV is much more endemic. Disentangling the roots\nof these differences is an important area for future work. Pre-\ncipitation has also been hypothesized to be important for influenza\ntransmission, although this has not been tested in laboratory\nsettings, likely due to the relative complexity of experimental set-\nup35. It is unknown whether physical processes such as aerosol\ndeposition, or behavioral processes such as grouping indoors,\nexplain the mechanism of precipitation drivers of transmission for\nboth RSV and influenza.\nARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-13562-y\n4 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS |         (2019) 10:5512 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-13562-y | www.nature.com/naturecommunications\nThere are important caveats to our results. We made the\ndecision to remove dummy variables in future projections so that\nannual variation in forced climate could flexibly determine\ntransmission. However, this means our simulations do not\naccount for non-climatic factors that may also structure trans-\nmission. We crudely tested this by using a common seasonal fixed\neffect which gave qualitatively similar results, reinforcing the\nrobustness of our assumption. Developing a richer understanding\nof the mechanisms connecting climate to transmission would\nhelp validate our results further. Our model also does not take\ninto account genetic sub-type of RSV30 due to data limitations in\nthe US and Mexico. We also do not consider age structure or\npotential secondary infections: secondary RSV infections are less\nsevere27. Nonetheless, we are able to capture the limit cycle\nstructure of RSV dynamics well and elucidate multiple streams of\nevidence for a fundamental climate effect.\nThe public health implications of changes to future RSV epi-\ndemic dynamics will depend on location-specific climatic chan-\nges. Precipitation-driven increases to epidemic intensity, caused\nby climate change or other large-scale climatic events such as the\nEl-Nino-Southern Oscillation, will require increased surge capa-\ncity in locations that typically observe more uniformly distributed\ncases31. Humidity-driven reductions to the seasonal change in\ntransmission in other locations will result in persistent epidemics,\nmeaning cases will occur outside of the typical \u201cRSV season\u201d\nrequiring changes to the temporal allocation of resources.\nChanging dynamics can also alter the age of infection36,37. This\nconsideration is important given that early RSV infections have\nbeen implicated in the later life development of asthma17.\nUnderstanding the impact of climate change on the trans-\nmission dynamics of infectious diseases is critical for predicting\nand preparing for future outbreaks and the optimal deployment\nof future vaccines. Our results highlight the nonlinear impact of\nclimate on RSV dynamics, across a wide range of climatic con-\nditions. Shifts in the timing and magnitude of RSV outbreaks will\nbe location-specific, depending on the realized climatic change. In\nregions where transmission is dominated by humidity, we can be\nrelatively confident in our projections. However, in regions where\nprecipitation dominates transmission, the future dynamics of\nRSV are more uncertain. Efforts to better resolve precipitation\nprojections across climate models will improve the precision of\nthese results. These findings also have potential implications for\nother airborne pathogens and future research efforts should be\ndirected towards understanding the various processes through\nwhich climate affects airborne transmission. More broadly, our\npreliminary comparison between RSV and influenza reveals the\npotential for comparative studies to elucidate the mechanisms of\nclimatic forcing for major respiratory infections.\nMethods\nData. The US county-level RSV dataset comes from hospitalizations data originally\nobtained from the State Inpatient Databases (SIDs) of the Healthcare Cost and\nUtilization Project (HCUP) maintained by the Agency for Healthcare Research and\nQuality (AHRQ). HCUP SIDs data represents on average 96% of community\nhospital inpatient discharges for reporting states, though not all states participate in\ndata collection. There are some fluctuations in the number of community hospitals\nreporting over time, depending on the state. The standard deviation in percentage\nreporting in 2% on average. Hospitalization records that included the International\nClassification of Diseases 9th revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code for\nRSV (079.6, 466.11, 480.1) within the 15 discharge diagnoses were included.\nHospitalization data were made available at the weekly level. Hospitalization data\nare available from 1989, however, a change in reporting codes in 1996 results in a\nlarge increase in cases at this time. To avoid potential bias from the switch in\nreporting, we take all county-level observations from 1997 onward.

We remove any counties that have <5 years of consecutive\nobservations due to potential erroneous model-fitting over this shorter time series,\nthough these counties are retained when plotting spatial averages.\nState-level Mexico hospitalization data come from the Subsistema\nAutomatizado de Egresos Hospitalarios (SAEH) collected by the Sistema Nacional\nde Informaci\u00f3n en Salud (SINAIS) and overseen by Secretar\u00eda de Salud. We take\ndata from all cases of bronchiolitis (ICD-10 codes J21.0, J21.1, J21.8, J21.9), a\nserious respiratory tract infection primarily caused by RSV38 (Supplementary Table\n8). Data were summed over the week to match the US data and reflect the\ngeneration time of RSV. Mexico data cover all years from 2000 to 2014.\nTemperature and specific humidity data come from the North America\nRegional Reanalysis (NARR) gridded dataset39, produced by the National Centers\nfor Environmental Prediction (NCEP). This high resolution dataset (32 km, daily\nobservations) spans the geographic and temporal extent of our health data.\nPrecipitation data come from Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with\nStation data (CHIRPS)40. Spatial averages are constructed using shapefiles for US\ncounties from the United States Census Bureau and for Mexican states.\nClimate projections data come from the Coupled Model Intercomparison\nProject Phase 5 (CMIP5). Precipitation projections come from all CMIP5 models\nrun under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 scenario. Specific\nhumidity is calculated from projections for temperature and relative humidity\nbased on the multi-model mean, accessed via the KNMI Climate Explorer (https://\nclimexp.knmi.nl/start.cgi).\nPopulation data for the US were obtained from publicly-available combined\nfiles of United States Census Bureau data available via the National Bureau of\nEconomic Research. US birth data were downloaded from the Centers for Disease\nControl. Demographic data for Mexico were obtained from the Instituto Nacional\nde Estad\u00edstica y Geograf\u00eda. Annual county (US) and state (Mexico) population\nestimates from these sources were interpolated at the weekly level using a cubic\nspline to avoid stepwise jumps at year transitions.\nCounty-level data in the United States are noisier than state-level averages used\nin ref. 27, however, they provide some advantages. For instance, state-level time\nseries for California show a dynamic transition from biennial outbreaks to annual\noutbreaks in 1999. At the county level we observe biennial cycles persisting from\n1999 onward in California but with northern counties and southern counties out-\nof-phase (Supplementary Fig. 4). This suggests that using county-level data may\nprovide a more accurate picture of location-specific dynamics.\nDefinitions. We define three types of dynamic pattern observed in the location-\nspecific time series within the dataset. Shallow-trough dynamics are defined as\nwhen the annual mean minimum incidence for a particular location exceeds 5% of\nthe mean maximum incidence. Biennial locations are defined using the significance\nof the biennial signal using the Lomb-Scargle periodogram. We use a significance\nvalue of 1% (all p-values under 5% are shown in the chloropleth Supplementary\nFig. 3a, as well as the ratio of biennial to annual Fourier amplitudes in Supple-\nmentary Fig. 3b27). When running simulations for Fig. 3, we define chaotic regions\nas locations where the Lyapunov constant is positive.\nTo calculate mean onset week we first calculate mean incidence per week (i.e.,\neach week averaged over all years for a given locations), and then normalize these\nvalues between 0 and 1. We define the start of the epidemic period as the 26th week\nof the year, approximately the first week of July. This period is chosen as it spans all\nepidemics within our data (Supplementary Fig. 6). We define onset as when\nnormalized incidence exceeds 0.2, assuming this value is low enough to constitute\nonset but high enough to exceed random fluctuations in the data. Using\nnormalized incidence, as opposed to incidence/population thresholds, allows to\ncreate a uniform measure across both US and Mexican datasets in spite of sampling\ndifferences between the two locations.\nModeling approach. Our modeling approach follows two steps29. We first use the\ntime series TSIR model, a discrete time adaptation of the SIR model14,41, to esti-\nmate the unobserved susceptible population for each location over time. Next, we\nuse the estimated susceptible time series to construct an empirical transmission\nrate. The transmission rate is used as a dependent variable in a panel regression\nwhere the effect of climate is estimated.\nThe TSIR model. The TSIR model describes the number infected and susceptible\nindividuals as a set of difference equations. The number of susceptible individuals\nis given by:\nSt\u00fe1 \u00bc St \u00fe Bt \u0003 It \u00fe ut \u00f01\u00de\nwhere St and It are the number of susceptible individuals and the number of\ninfected individuals, respectively, and the time period, t, is the generation time for\nRSV approximated as 1 week. Bt are births and ut is additive noise, with E\u00bdut \u0004 \u00bc 0.\nThe susceptible population at each time step can be written as St \u00bc \u0001S\u00fe Zt , where \u0001S\nis the mean number of susceptible individuals in the population and Zt is the\nunknown deviation from the mean number of susceptible individuals at each time\nstep. The susceptible equation can thus be rewritten in terms of deviations Zt and\niterated successively with the starting condition Z0, giving:\nXt\u00031\nk\u00bc0\nBk \u00bc \u0003Z0 \u00fe 1=\u03c1\nXt\u00031\nk\u00bc0\nIrk \u00fe Zt \u00fe ut \u00f02\u00de\nwhere \u03c1 is the reporting rate which accounts for both under-reporting of RSV\nhospitalizations as well as infections that did not result in hospitalization and Irk is\nthe reported incidence. Using this equation, Zt is estimated as the residuals from\nthe linear regression of cumulative births on cumulative cases, assuming ut is small.\nThe inverse of the slope of the regression line provides an estimate of the reporting\nrate \u03c1. Zt estimates can be used to reconstruct the susceptible time series though\nmust be combined with an estimate for \u0001S. We calculate this by defining the\nexpected number of infected cases at each time step, E\u00bdIt\u00fe1\u0004, as:\nE\u00bdIt\u00fe1\u0004 \u00bc\n\u03b2t I\n\u03b1\nt St\nNt\n\u00f03\u00de\nwhich is log-linearized as:\nln\u00f0E\u00bdIt\u00fe1\u0004\u00de \u00bc ln\u00f0\u03b2t\u00de \u00fe \u03b1ln\u00f0It\u00de \u00fe ln\u00f0\u0001S\u00fe Zt\u00de \u0003 ln\u00f0Nt\u00de \u00f04\u00de\nwhere \u03b2t are biweekly factors that capture the seasonal trend in transmission rate\nand \u03b1 is a constant that captures heterogeneities in mixing and the discretization of\na continuous time process. We fix \u03b1 at 0.97 to be consistent with prior studies42.\nBiweekly seasonal betas, as opposed to weekly betas, are estimated to avoid the\noverfitting of parameters due to the high correlation in transmission rates across\nsuccessive weeks. Equation (4) is fit using a Poisson regression with log link. Final\nresults are robust to using a negative binomial at this stage (Supplementary\nTable 7). The mean number of susceptible individuals, \u0001S, can then be estimated\nusing marginal profile likelihoods from estimating Eq. (4), for a range of candidate\nvalues. The TSIR model is used to reconstruct St for each location in the dataset.\nAn empirical estimate of the transmission rate, Em\u03b2t , was then calculated for each\nlocation and time step in the dataset by rewriting Eq. (3), assuming that\nE\u00bdIt\u00fe1\u0004 \u00bc It\u00fe1:\nEm\u03b2t \u00bc\nIt\u00fe1Nt\nI\u03b1t St\n\u00f05\u00de\nTo avoid inflation of Em\u03b2t we add one to zero observations in the infected time\nseries which represents continual low-level background transmission resulting in\nthe lack of epidemic extinction we observe in the data. Model results are also robust\nto removing zero observations from the infected time series (Supplementary\nTable 3). For fitting the TSIR we use the tsiR package43. Example TSIR fits are\nshown in Supplementary Fig. 7.\n0 5 10 15 20\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\nPr\n(In\nflu\nen\nza\n pe\na\nk)\nSpecific humidity\n0 5 10 15 20\n0.00\n0.04\n0.08\n0.12\nLo\ng \nRS\nV \ntra\nn\nsm\nis\nsi\non\nSpecific humidity\na\nb\nFig. 4 Comparison with influenza results. Removing precipitation from our\nregression model and including a quadratic humidity term reveals a very\nsimilar response (a) to earlier work on influenza (b adapted from Tamerius\net al.9, Fig 3a) suggesting potential similar mechanisms underlie the climate\neffect on the two diseases. Predicted minimum transmission for RSV occurs\nat 11.16 g/kg, with influenza found to be similarly 11\u201312 g/kg9. Tamerius\net al. suggest precipitation may drive the right hand side of the humidity-\ninfluenza curve, as we find for RSV.\nARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-13562-y\n6 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS |         (2019) 10:5512 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-13562-y | www.nature.com/naturecommunications\nWe remove data from all US counties where the R2 of the TSIR fit is <0.5 (101\ncounties). These locations tend to be in counties with very low population numbers\nwhere low-level stochastic variability in cases becomes proportional to the size of\nseasonal variation. Our results are robust to using the full dataset and a population-\nbased cut off (Supplementary Tables 5 and 6). The time series in the Mexican\ndataset are noisier than the United States, even for larger population states, which\nwe hypothesize is due to the stochastic nature of rainfall drivers that dominate in\nthis region and also due to sampling issues such as a higher threshold for\nhospitalization. In Mexico, we remove data from two states where the TSIR model\ndoes not provide a good fit due to very sparse data (under 10 cases at maximum in\nthe time series): Colima and Queretaro. Our final dataset to which we fit the main\nregression model has 214 locations and a total of 119,802 location-by-week\nobservations. Model results are robust to including data from all US counties and\nMexico (Supplementary Table 5).\nPanel regression. We fit a linear regression model using the empirical trans-\nmission rate as a dependent variable:\nln\u00f0Em\u03b2t;l\u00de \u00bc b1\u00f01=Ht;l\u00de \u00fe b2Pt;l \u00fe \u03b3l;m \u00fe \u03b4l;y \u00fe \u03f5t;l \u00f06\u00de\nwhere Em\u03b2t;l is the empirical transmission at time t and location l, Htl is humidity,\nand Pt;l is precipitation. We include location-by-month dummies \u03b3l;m that remove\nlocation-specific seasonal variation in transmission which may be confounded by\nother seasonally varying factors such as school semesters. We also include location-\nby-year dummies \u03b4l;y that remove location-specific trends in transmission or epi-\nsodic transmission events that may be spuriously correlated with climate. Standard\nerrors are clustered at the location level, though White\u2019s standard errors give\nsimilar results (Supplementary Table 4).\nNonparametric binned models and general additive models are also fitted to test\nthe accuracy of the fitted functional form of the specific humidity and precipitation\nrelationship (Supplementary Fig. 8 and 9). Lagged precipitation and humdity, in\nthe week prior to transmission, are tested but not found to be significant\n(Supplementary Table 9).\nSimulations. We run several different simulations to test for the effect of climate\non the epidemic dynamics of RSV. To allow for climate to fully characterize the\nseasonal changes in transmission and mean transmission we re-estimate Eq. (6)\nremoving dummy variable controls as:\nln\u00f0Em\u03b2t;l\u00de \u00bc b1\u00f01=Ht;l\u00de \u00fe b2Pt;l \u00fe \u03f5t;l \u00f07\u00de\nThis model may be biased by other seasonally varying or location-specific\ntrends and as such represents an upper bound on the climate effect. Results from\nthis model are shown in Supplementary Fig. 11 and are significant (p \u0001 0:001).\nWe run simulations over the parameter space of mean transmission and\nseasonal change in transmission values with the aim of evaluating (1) the location\nof bifurcations (Fig. 3a left plot) and (2) the difference between present and 2100\nfuture projected dynamics (Fig. 3a right plot). In order to smoothly vary the\nseasonal change in transmission across the parameter space we use a cosine\nfunction to represent seasonality in humidity. Simulations are run for 50 years to\nremove the effect of transients and only the last 10 years are analyzed. To keep\nother factors constant, demographics in these simulations are based on Kings\nCounty, New York. In Fig. 3a (right), we plot an arrow for each location within\nour dataset where the base of the arrow represents the estimated present\nparameter values and the point of the arrow represents the projected future\nparameter values.\nTo produce Fig. 3b we run simulations this time allowing seasonal climate\nvariations to fully specify the seasonal and mean transmission rate, removing the\ncosine structure. We take output from all 23 climate models included in the CMIP5\nmean. For each model we calculate the ratio of the week-of-year average rainfall at\nthe end of the century to the start of the century (using a 5-year average anomaly in\neach case). We then apply this ratio to the observed precipitation in our\ndataset also averaged over a 5-year period to minimize bias from comparing model\noutput to observational data. We apply the same method to the model-mean\nspecific humidity. Projected precipitation and humidity are input into Eq. (7) to\ncalculate a seasonally varying transmission rate. Forward simulations are run for 50\nyears to remove transients with only the last 5 years shown in Fig. 3b.\nReporting summary.

An early study using a\n4-level general circulation model found that heavy daily\nprecipitation events become more frequent in response\nto elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations [27]. Nu-\nmerous model studies since then have also found an\nintensification of precipitation extremes with climate\nwarming (with important regional variations), and this\nhas been confirmed in the available historical record\nover land, as will be discussed in detail in later sections.\nUnderstanding of changes in precipitation extremes\nis better than for changes in other extremes such as tor-\nnadoes [44], but large uncertainties and research chal-\nlenges remain. If changes in dynamics and precipitation\nefficiency are negligible, precipitation extremes increase\nwith warming because of increases in the saturation va-\npor pressure of water [85,86,4,62]; this will be made\nmore precise in section 3. However, dynamical contri-\nbutions and changes in precipitation efficiency may also\nplay an important role. Mesoscale convective organi-\nzation is important for the dynamics of precipitation\nextremes in the tropics (and seasonally in the midlat-\nitudes) but it is not resolved in global models, while\nat the same time there are relatively few observational\nrecords of tropical precipitation extremes for estimating\nlong-term trends and sensitivities. At higher latitudes,\nthe effect of climate change on snowfall extremes and\nfreezing rain will be different from its effect on rainfall\nextremes and requires further study. In terms of im-\npacts, the duration of extreme precipitation events and\nthe response of orographic precipitation extremes are\nboth important and are only now receiving substantial\nresearch attention.\nThis paper reviews and elaborates on some of the\nrecent research on how climate change affects precipi-\ntation extremes, including observed changes in the his-\n2 Paul A.

The primary focus is on the physical factors\nthat control the intensity of precipitation extremes in\ndifferent climates. Open questions are discussed through-\nout and in section 8.\n2 Observed changes in precipitation extremes\nRecords of precipitation that are sufficient to detect\nlong term trends in extremes are primarily from rain\ngauges over land. Over the available record, there are re-\ngions with both increasing and decreasing trends in pre-\ncipitation extremes [28,1], as might be expected given\nlarge internal variability [25], but the gridboxes or sta-\ntions with significant increasing trends outnumber those\nwith significant decreasing trends [23,91]. Anthropogenic\nforcing has been shown to have contributed to the inten-\nsification of precipitation extremes over Northern Hemi-\nsphere land [53,95]. Assessments have also been made\nof the effect of anthropogenic forcing on the probability\nof specific extreme precipitation or flooding events us-\ning ensembles of climate-model simulations [64,63,32].\nOne approach that reduces the influence of unforced\nvariability while still distinguishing large-scale varia-\ntions is to analyze the sensitivity of precipitation ex-\ntremes averaged over all stations or grid boxes in a\nlatitude band [91,6]. Figure 1a shows an example of\nthis type of analysis in which annual-maximum daily\nprecipitation rates over land from the HadEX2 gridded\ndataset [23] have been regressed over the period 1901\nto 2010 against temperature anomalies from NOAA\u2019s\nMerged Land-Ocean Surface Temperature Analysis (MLOST)\n[80]. The precipitation rates are over land only, but pre-\ncipitation extremes do not necessarily scale with the lo-\ncal land mean temperature because of advection of wa-\nter vapor from over the ocean such as in atmospheric\nrivers [21,46], and the temperatures used here are over\nboth land and ocean. For each gridbox with at least 30\nyears of data, the annual-maximum daily precipitation\nrates are regressed against the global-mean surface tem-\nperature anomalies using the Theil-Sen estimator, and\nthe regression coefficient is divided by the mean of the\nannual-maximum daily precipitation rate at the grid-\nbox to give a sensitivity that is expressed in units of %\nK\u22121. The median of the sensitivities is then calculated\nfor all gridboxes in 15\u25e6 latitude bands.1 The resulting\nsensitivity is positive for most latitude bands, the 90%\nconfidence interval is above zero for all latitude bands\nin the Northern Hemisphere, and the global sensitiv-\nity (averaging over latitude bands with area weighting)\nis 8% K\u22121 with a 90% confidence interval of 5 to 10\n% K\u22121. These results, similar to those obtained pre-\nviously [91,6], provide evidence for an intensification\nof annual-maximum daily precipitation as the global-\nmean temperature has risen over the last century, and\nat a rate that is roughly consistent with what might be\nexpected from theory. However, the meridional struc-\nture of the sensitivities within the tropics is sensitive to\nthe details of the analysis (cf. [91,6]).\nExtratropical precipitation extremes at a given lat-\nitude occur when the atmosphere is warmer than av-\nerage and are more closely tied to mean temperatures\nsomewhat further equatorward [61,62,21]. However, they\n1 The circles in Fig. 1 are plotted at the midpoints of\nthe latitude bands. There are relatively few gridboxes for\nsome latitude bands, and higher-latitude bands with little\ndata are excluded. Uncertainty is estimated by bootstrap-\nping the years used at each gridbox (1000 bootstrap samples\nare generated) and then calculating a 90% confidence interval\nfor the median sensitivity in each latitude band (or averaged\nover several latitude bands).\nPrecipitation extremes under climate change 3\nare still expected to respond primarily to changes in\nmean temperatures in the extratropics rather than the\ntropics, and recent warming has been greater in the\nnorthern extratropics than the tropics. The sensitivi-\nties shown in Fig. 1a are based on global-mean surface\ntemperature and do not account for the variation in\nwarming with latitude. Fig. 1b shows an alternative\nanalysis in which the annual-maximum daily precipi-\ntation rates at each gridbox are regressed against the\narea-weighted mean temperature anomaly for the 15\u25e6\nlatitude band that contains the gridbox. The latitude-\nband temperature timeseries are filtered using a nine-\nyear running mean prior to performing the regression.\nThis filtering reduces the influence of short-term vari-\nability in regional temperatures which has previously\nbeen found to give a different sensitivity of precipita-\ntion extremes than long-term climate change [58]. The\nresults in Fig. 1b show a higher sensitivity of precipi-\ntation extremes in the tropics compared to the extrat-\nropics, although the uncertainty in the tropics is large\nreflecting the sparse data there. The sensitivity for the\ntropics (30S to 30N) is 9% K\u22121 (90% confidence inter-\nval 6-14% K\u22121), while for the extratropics it is 4% K\u22121\n(90% confidence interval 2-5% K\u22121). The choice of fil-\nter for the temperature time series affects the overall\nmagnitudes of the sensitivities but not whether sensi-\ntivities are higher in the tropics than the extratropics.\nInterestingly, higher sensitivities in the tropics are also\nfound when projections from global climate models are\nconstrained by satellite observations [58] as discussed\nin section 4.2.\n3 Theory\nTo understand the response of precipitation extremes to\nwarming, our starting point is an approximation for the\nsurface precipitation rate P in an extreme precipitation\nevent,\nP \u2243 \u2212\u01eb {\u03c9(p)S(T, p)} , (1)\nwhere \u01eb is a precipitation efficiency, \u03c9 is the vertical\nvelocity in pressure coordinates (negative for upward\nmotion), S(T, p) = dqs/dp|\u03b8\u2217\ne\nis the derivative of the\nsaturation specific humidity qs with respect to pres-\nsure p taken at constant saturation equivalent poten-\ntial temperature \u03b8\u2217e (i.e., the derivative along a moist\nadiabat), and {\u00b7} is a mass-weighted vertical integral\nover the troposphere [61,56]. All quantities in equa-\ntion (1) are evaluated locally in the extreme event. The\nnet condensation rate is approximated by \u2212\u03c9 S either\nthrough consideration of the condensation rate in a ris-\ning saturated air parcel [62] or using a dry static en-\nergy budget in the tropics [56]. The precipitation effi-\nciency \u01eb is defined as the ratio of surface precipitation\nto the column-integrated net condensation; it accounts\nfor condensate and precipitation storage or transport\nfrom the column. Note that \u01eb is not a conventional pre-\ncipitation efficiency because it is defined in terms of net\ncondensation (condensation minus evaporation) rather\nthan condensation.\nAccording to equation (1), changes in the precip-\nitation rate in extreme events under climate change\nhave a dynamical contribution from changes in \u03c9, a\nthermodynamic contribution from changes in S (this is\ntermed thermodynamic since S only depends on tem-\nperature and pressure), and a microphysical component\nfrom changes in the precipitation efficiency \u01eb. Relative\nhumidity does not explicitly appear in equation (1), but\nit can affect precipitation extremes through the dynam-\nics and by helping to set the duration of precipitation\nevents. The fractional increase in S with warming is in-\nfluenced by changes in the moist adiabatic lapse rate\n[11,62] and varies strongly depending on temperature\nand therefore altitude in the atmosphere. However, for\na moist-adiabatic stratification and convergence con-\nfined to near the surface, the thermodynamic contri-\nbution can be shown to scale in a similar way to near\nsurface specific humidities [61,70,56]. This scaling is of-\nten referred to as Clausius-Clapeyron scaling and gives\na sensitivity of 6-7% K\u22121 for typical surface tempera-\ntures. More generally, the thermodynamic contribution\ndepends on the weighting of S by the vertical veloc-\nity profile in the vertical integral in equation (1), and a\nrange of higher and lower rates of change from the ther-\nmodynamic contribution have been found in different\nsimulations [61,56,73]. It is sometimes stated that the\ndynamical contribution must be positive for a warm-\ning climate because of increases in latent heating, but\nthis is not necessarily the case because other factors\nsuch as increases in dry static stability or reductions in\nmeridional temperature gradients can counteract the\nincreases in latent heating. Instead, the dynamical con-\ntribution is discussed here separately for different dy-\nnamical regimes. For example, increases in convective\nupdraft velocities with warming are discussed in the\nnext paragraph, and changes in large-scale vertical ve-\nlocities in the extratropics are discussed in section 4.1\nusing the omega equation.\nThe simplest configuration for which the contribu-\ntions to changes in precipitation extremes have been\nanalyzed is radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE) in\na doubly periodic domain [70,56,55,77]. There are no\nlarge-scale dynamics in RCE, and cloud-system resolv-\ning models (CRMs) are used to resolve the convective-\nscale dynamics. Both the convective available potential\nenergy (CAPE) and the updraft velocities in the middle\n4 Paul A.

But the increases in updraft velocities in the upper\ntroposphere do not strongly affect the precipitation ex-\ntremes because the factor of S(p) in equation (1) gives\nmore weight to the vertical velocities in the lower tro-\nposphere in determining the intensity of precipitation\nextremes. For surface temperatures near those of the\npresent-day tropics, the precipitation extremes increase\nat close to the thermodynamic rate, and this is close to\nClausius-Clapeyron scaling with the surface specific hu-\nmidity, with relatively small contributions from changes\nin vertical velocities and precipitation efficiency [70,56,\n77]. The same behavior is found when convection is or-\nganized in a squall line [55]. However, for temperatures\nbelow 295K, the precipitation efficiency can change sub-\nstantially with warming and the scaling of precipitation\nextremes then depends on the accumulation period con-\nsidered [77], as discussed in section 7.\n4 Climate-model projections\nClimate models provide global coverage for precipita-\ntion extremes [84,39] and more detailed coverage on\nregional scales [22,36,37,8]. They may be applied to dif-\nferent emissions scenarios or individual radiative forc-\nings [38,18,35], and they allow relatively straightfor-\nward investigations into the role of dynamics and other\nfactors that contribute to precipitation intensity [24,65,\n61,83]. Important limitations in the ability of current\nmodels to simulate precipitation extremes have also\nbeen recognized and are related in part to the use of\nparameterized convection [93,38,58,89,43].\nGlobal models precipitate too frequently with too\nlow a mean precipitation intensity [20,82], but this does\nnot necessarily mean that they underestimate the inten-\nsity of precipitation extremes. For example, in an anal-\nysis of 30-year return values of daily precipitation over\nthe conterminous United States, most global climate\nmodels were found to overestimate or roughly agree\nwith observations that were conservatively interpolated\nto the model resolution for comparison [17]. (Appropri-\nate interpolation of precipitation is important because\nof mismatches in time and space scales between models\nand observations.) One exception was the Community\nClimate Model System 3 which underestimated the 30-\nyear return values [17], and increased horizontal res-\nolution [90] or use of superparameterization [49] have\nbeen shown to improve the representation of the in-\ntensity distribution of precipitation in the Community\nAtmosphere Model versions 2 and 3. The model bias of\ntoo-frequent precipitation mentioned above will affect\npercentiles calculated over only wet days rather than all\ndays [9], even if the extreme events are properly simu-\nlated, which suggests that calculating extremes using all\ndays (or all hours) is preferable for comparison of pre-\ncipitation extremes between models and observations.\nProjections of 21st century climate change with global\nclimate models show a general increase in the intensity\nof precipitation extremes except in some regions in the\nsubtropics [38,39]. To illustrate basic features of the\nresponse, Fig. 2 shows the sensitivity of the 99.9th per-\ncentile of daily precipitation to warming as a function\nof latitude in simulations with 15 global climate models\nfrom the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase\n5 (CMIP5). Sensitivities for climate change (% K\u22121)\nare calculated as the change in the 99.9th percentile\nbetween the final two decades of the 20th century in\nthe historical simulations and the final two decades of\nthe 21st century in the warmer RCP8.5 simulations,\nnormalized by the value in the historical simulations\nand the change in global-mean surface air tempera-\nture.2 Note that the sensitivities from observations in\n2 The model names and the exact time periods used are\ngiven in [58]. The daily precipitation rates are first conser-\nvatively interpolated [17] to an equal-area grid with constant\nspacing in longitude of 3 degrees. Following [61], the precipita-\ntion extremes in a given climate are calculated by aggregating\ndaily precipitation rates (over both land and ocean and in-\ncluding dry days) at a given latitude and then calculating the\n99.9th percentile. Calculating the change in precipitation ex-\ntremes at each gridbox and then taking the zonal average has\nPrecipitation extremes under climate change 5\nFig. 1 and from simulations in Fig. 2 should not be com-\npared in detail because of the different time periods,\ngeographic coverage, and measure of extreme precipi-\ntation used. We next discuss the simulated response of\nextratropical precipitation extremes, followed by tropi-\ncal precipitation extremes and the use of observed vari-\nability to better constrain the intermodel spread.\n4.1 Extratropical precipitation extremes\nThe multimodel-median sensitivity is shown by the green\nline with circles in Fig. 2, and the multimodel-median\nof the sensitivity averaged over the extratropics is 6%\nK\u22121. A slightly lower extratropical sensitivity of 5%\nK\u22121 is obtained if it is normalized by the change in\nextratropical-mean surface temperature rather than global-\nmean surface temperature. The intermodel spread in\nthe response (dotted lines in Fig. 2) is small in the ex-\ntratropics, consistent with the fact that most precipi-\ntation extremes there are associated with cyclones and\nfronts [69,13] that may be expected to be reasonably\nwell simulated. However, global models with conven-\ntional parameterizations are unable to simulate precipi-\ntation extremes from mesoscale convective systems over\nmidlatitudes in summer [43], and so the results from\nthese models are not reliable for regions and times of\nyear in which these systems are important.\nEquation (1) with the precipitation efficiency \u01eb held\nfixed reproduces the fractional changes in precipitation\nextremes in CMIP3 simulations [61,83]. The thermo-\ndynamic contribution in these simulations is close to\nwhat would be expected from scaling of precipitation\nextremes with surface specific humidity, and this im-\nplies a lower rate of increase than scaling with column\nwater vapor [60]. In the extratropics, the simulated rate\nof increase of precipitation extremes is close to the ther-\nmodynamic contribution at all latitudes, and there is\nlittle dynamical contribution from changes in vertical\nvelocities [24,61]. A stronger dynamical contribution re-\nsembling a poleward shift has been found in idealized\naquaplanet simulations [62,51].\nWhy is there no general strengthening or weakening\nof large-scale vertical velocities associated with simu-\nlated extratropical precipitation extremes despite changes\nin latent heating and dry static stability? As a start-\ning point, consider the quasigeostrophic omega equa-\ntion written as\n\u22072\n(\n\u03c3\u03c9 +\n\u03baJ\np\n)\n+ f2\n0\n\u22022\n\u2202p2\n\u03c9 = RHS, (2)\nbeen found to give similar results [65]. The sensitivities are\naveraged over 10\u25e6 latitude bands for presentation in Fig. 2.\nwhere \u03c9 is the vertical velocity in pressure coordinates,\n\u03c3 is the dry static stability parameter, J is the dia-\nbatic heating rate, \u03ba is the ratio of the gas constant\nto the specific heat capacity at constant pressure, p is\npressure, f0 is a reference value of the Coriolis param-\neter, and the right-hand-side (RHS) includes vorticity\nand temperature advection terms but not the static sta-\nbility or diabatic heating rate [34]. This equation is the\nsimplest equation for the vertical velocity that accounts\nfor dynamical balance, and it is used here to gain some\ninsight into the controls on large-scale vertical veloci-\nties in the extratropics, although it is not expected to\nbe quantitatively accurate. In a strong non-convective\nevent with saturated ascent, J will be dominated by\nlatent heating and \u03c3 + \u03baJ/(p\u03c9) is a measure of the\nmoist static stability. This moist static stability will be\nsmall if the stratification is close to moist adiabatic, as\nwas the case, for example, in the extreme precipitation\nevent in the Colorado Front Range in September 2013\n[26]. For a region of upward motion that is sufficiently\nbroad in the horizontal with small moist static stability,\nthe omega equation (2) reduces to f20\n\u22022\n\u2202p2\n\u03c9 \u2243 RHS, and\nthe effect of climate change on the vertical velocity \u03c9\ndoes not depend on changes in static stability or latent\nheating. The vertical velocity still depends on RHS, but\nchanges in this would be expected to be relatively small\ngiven modest changes in eddy kinetic energy [57] and\neddy length [40].\nThe omega equation (2) gives, therefore, some in-\nsight as to why the vertical velocities associated with\nlarge-scale extratropical precipitation extremes might\nnot change greatly under climate change. The term pro-\nportional to f2\n0\non the left hand side of equation (2)\narises from planetary rotation and it makes the large-\nscale vertical velocity much less sensitive to deviations\nfrom a moist adiabatic stratification when compared to\nsmall-scale convective updrafts (see sections 3 and 7).\nWe next turn to the tropics where the dynamical influ-\nence of planetary rotation is weaker and where convec-\ntion is always a key factor for precipitation extremes.\n4.2 Tropical precipitation extremes\nAs compared to the extratropics, the intermodel range\nin the sensitivity of precipitation extremes is much larger\nin the tropics (Fig. 2), with close to zero sensitivity\nin some models and greater than 30%K\u22121 in others.\nAdditional reasons to doubt the response of tropical\nprecipitation extremes in these global climate models\ninclude the large differences between tropical precipi-\ntation extremes in 20th-century simulations in differ-\nent models [38], the inability of the models to repre-\nsent mesoscale convective organization [72] or to sim-\n6 Paul A. O\u2019Gorman\nulate the interannual variability in tropical precipita-\ntion extremes when compared to observations [2,3], and\nthe disproportionate increases in precipitation extremes\ncompared to other parts of the precipitation distribu-\ntion that is found in some models \u2013 an \u201cextreme mode\u201d\nin the tropical response to climate change that relates\nto gridpoint storms [67,66].\nObservations can be used to better constrain the\nlarge uncertainty in the response of tropical precipi-\ntation extremes to warming. The sensitivity of tropi-\ncal precipitation extremes for climate change in differ-\nent climate models is correlated with their sensitivity\nfor shorter term variability within a climate (variabil-\nity that is primarily related to El Nin\u02dco-Southern Os-\ncillation) [58]. For example, models with a relatively\nhigh sensitivity of tropical precipitation extremes for\nclimate change also have a relatively high sensitivity of\ntropical precipitation extremes for variability in histor-\nical simulations, although the sensitivities for climate\nchange and variability are generally different in value.\nThe robust relationship between the sensitivities across\nmodels has been used together with observed variabil-\nity to constrain the sensitivity of tropical precipitation\nextremes to climate change [58]. The black line in Fig. 2\nshows a similar observationally-constrained estimate of\nthe sensitivity of the 99.9th percentile of daily precip-\nitation for climate change, but instead of considering\nthe sensitivity for climate change aggregated over the\nwhole tropics as in [58], the analysis is applied sepa-\nrately to the sensitivity for climate change in 10\u25e6 lati-\ntude bands in both the tropics and extratropics.3 This\nobservationally-constrained estimate is similar to the\nmultimodel median in the extratropics but higher than\nthe multimodel median in the tropics. It peaks near\nthe equator and is higher for the tropics (11 % K\u22121,\n90% confidence interval 7-15 % K\u22121) than the extrat-\n3 The observationally-constrained estimate is obtained by\nregressing the sensitivity for climate change against the sen-\nsitivity for variability across the models, and then using this\nregression relationship together with the observed sensitivity\nfor variability to estimate the sensitivity for climate change.\nThe sensitivity for variability (% K\u22121) is calculated in both\nmodels and observations based on the 99.9th percentile of\ndaily precipitation rates aggregated over the tropical oceans\nand the mean surface temperature over the tropical oceans\n(30S to 30N) as described in detail in [58]. The sensitivities\nfor climate change are calculated in 10\u25e6 latitude bands rela-\ntive to the change in global-mean surface temperature, as for\nthe other sensitivities shown in Fig. 2. Differences in convec-\ntive parameterizations are less important in the extratropics,\nand the correlation coefficient across models between the sen-\nsitivities for climate change and variability becomes smaller\nfor climate change at higher latitudes, reaching a value of 0.5\nat 50S and 40N as compared to a maximum of 0.86 at 20N.\nSSM/I data from Remote Sensing Systems [33] are used for\nthe observed precipitation rates and NOAA MLOST data [80]\nfor the observed temperatures.\nropics (6 % K\u22121, 90% confidence interval 6-7% K\u22121).\nInterestingly, a higher sensitivity in the tropics com-\npared to the extratropics was also found using histor-\nical rain-gauge data (section 2). For the tropics, there\nstill remains considerable uncertainty in both the es-\ntimate from rain-gauge data and the observationally\nconstrained estimate discussed in this section, and bet-\nter constraining the sensitivity of tropical precipitation\nextremes is an important research challenge.\n5 Orographic precipitation extremes\nIdealized simulations have recently been used to study\nthe response of orographic precipitation extremes to cli-\nmate warming [74,73] (see also [41] for a more general\ndiscussion). A striking result from these studies is that\nthere are higher fractional changes in precipitation ex-\ntremes on the climatological leeward slope of the moun-\ntain as compared to the windward slope. Orographic\nprecipitation extremes must be treated as a special case\nfor several reasons. The thermodynamic contribution is\ninfluenced by the vertical profile of the vertical velocity\n(see equation 1), and the shape of this profile will gen-\nerally be different over a sloped lower boundary than\nover a flat lower boundary [74]. Downstream transport\nof precipitation means that the local precipitation ef-\nficiency can vary strongly over the mountain, and the\ncondensation that leads to leeward precipitation may\noccur relatively high in the atmosphere where sensitivi-\nties to temperature change are greater [74]. In addition,\nchanges in vertical velocities are governed by mountain\nwave dynamics and have been found to be different for\nextreme precipitation events on the western and eastern\nslopes of an idealized midlatitude mountain [73].\nA weakening of orographic rain shadows related to\nchanges in precipitation extremes has previously been\nnoted in simulations of climate warming over North\nAmerica [22,75]. Further study is needed to assess the\nrole played by the physical factors discussed above in\ndetermining changes in orographic precipitation extremes\nin comprehensive simulations and observations.\n6 Snowfall extremes\nChanges in snowfall extremes have received relatively\nlittle research attention, party because of the difficul-\nties in producing long-term records of snowfall. Obser-\nvational studies of daily snowfall extremes have been\nregional in nature and have found large interdecadal\nvariability with, for example, no long term trend for\nCanada [94] but more frequent extremes snowstorms in\nrecent decades in the eastern two-thirds of the United\nPrecipitation extremes under climate change 7\nStates [44]. Studies using different metrics have reached\ndifferent conclusions as to whether there are more heavy\nsnowfall events in anomalously warm or cold years or\nseasons in the United States [15,44]\nPhysically, snowfall extremes are expected to be af-\nfected by climate warming through both increases in\nsaturation vapor pressures and changes in the frequency\nof occurrence of temperatures below the rain-snow tran-\nsition temperature. A simple asymptotic theory of snow-\nfall extremes has been developed based on the temper-\nature dependencies of precipitation extremes and the\nrain-snow transition [59]. According to the simple the-\nory, snowfall extremes tend to occur near an optimal\ntemperature of roughly -2\u25e6C when snowfall is measured\nby liquid water equivalent. The optimal temperature\narises because saturation vapor pressures increase with\ntemperature whereas the fraction of precipitation that\nfalls as snow reduces sharply at surface temperatures\nnear freezing. When snowfall is measured by depth of\nsnow, the optimal temperature is lower (roughly -4\u25e6C)\nbecause the variation of snow density with temperature\nmust also be taken into account. For an infinitesimal\nclimate warming, the intensity of snowfall extremes de-\ncreases for climatological-mean temperatures above the\noptimal temperature and increases for climatological-\nmean temperatures below it. Furthermore, fractional\nchanges in high percentiles of snowfall are smaller the\nhigher the percentile considered (unlike for rainfall ex-\ntremes), such that fractional changes in the intensity\nof the most extreme events tend to be relatively small.\nThere may still be large fractional decreases in snow-\nfall extremes with warming in regions with climatolog-\nically mild temperatures, and changes in the frequency\nof exceeding a high threshold of snowfall may still be\nsubstantial.\nSnowfall extremes in simulations with global climate\nmodels from CMIP5 behave similarly to the simple the-\nory for sufficiently extreme statistics [59], although the\nclimatological temperature below which snowfall ex-\ntremes intensify is lower than the simple theory pre-\ndicts. The response of snowfall extremes is similar in\nthe subset of models that most realistically simulate\nArctic sea ice [59], the decline of which has been hy-\npothesized to affect midlatitude weather extremes [19].\nRegional climate-model simulations exhibit large frac-\ntional decreases in maximum winter daily snowfall over\nmuch of western Europe, but little change or increases\nin other parts of Europe that are climatologically colder\n[88]. As in the simple theory and in global climate-\nmodel simulations, there is a strong link in regional\nsimulations [88] and downscaled global simulations [52]\nbetween the changes in snowfall extremes and the local\nclimatological temperature in the control climate.\nIn\nte\nns\nity\n (m\nm \nh\u2212\n1 )\n \n a\nInst. 1h 3h 6h Daily\n1\n10\n100\n304K\n295K\n286K\n277K\nSe\nns\nitiv\nity\n (%\n K\u2212\n1 )\nb\nInst. 1h 3h 6h Daily\n0\n3\n6\n9\n12\nFig. 3 (a) The 99.99th percentile of precipitation for differ-\nent durations (instantaneous, 1h, 3h, 6h, and daily) in simula-\ntions of radiative-convective equilibrium with a cloud-system\nresolving model at selected mean surface-air temperatures\nas given in the legend.

In a recent climate-model\nstudy, intensity-duration-frequency curves were calcu-\nlated for accumulation periods from 6 hours to 10 days,\nand the curves were found to shift upwards in intensity\non a logarithmic scale in a relatively simple way as the\nclimate warms [35]. However, it is not clear that global\nclimate models can be relied on for subdaily extremes\nbecause of the potential importance of convective pro-\ncesses. Indeed, for regional simulations of midlatitudes\nin summer, changing from a model with convective pa-\nrameterization to a CRM has been found to lead to\na marked improvement in the intensity distribution of\nhourly precipitation [8] and to significantly alter the\nsimulated response of hourly precipitation extremes to\nclimate change [37].\n8 Paul A. O\u2019Gorman\nLong-term observational records of subdaily precip-\nitation are relatively sparse, which makes it difficult to\ngive a general assessment of trends in subdaily extremes\n[92]. Many recent observational studies have instead fo-\ncussed on the relationship between short-duration pre-\ncipitation rates and the local surface temperature in\nvariability within the current climate. In the first of\nthese studies, a high resolution record from the Nether-\nlands was found to give a sensitivity of 7%K\u22121 for\ndaily precipitation as compared to 14%K\u22121 for hourly\nprecipitation over a range of temperatures [47]. Simi-\nlar behavior was found in some but not all subsequent\nstudies in different regions [31,48,87,54,10]; see [92] for\nan in-depth discussion. Factors such as relative humid-\nity [31,48], large-scale dynamics and temperature gra-\ndients [54], and transitions from stratiform to convec-\ntive precipitation [29,10] are thought to be important\nfor the scaling of precipitation extremes with tempera-\nture in the current climate, and some of these factors\nmay have a different effect on hourly and daily precip-\nitation. While the sensitivity of precipitation extremes\nfor long term climate change need not be the same as\nfor variability in a given climate [58,9], understanding\nthe sensitivity of subdaily precipitation extremes in the\npresent-day climate is an important starting point.\nIdealized CRM studies suggest that changes in both\ndynamics and precipitation efficiency could contribute\nto the scaling of subdaily convective precipitation ex-\ntremes with temperature. Convective precipitation ex-\ntremes have been found to increase with warming con-\nsiderably faster than implied by Clausius-Clapeyron scal-\ning in some cases when a temperature increase is im-\nposed that is constant in the vertical [79,7]. This is\nnot surprising because a vertically-uniform tempera-\nture increase makes a moist atmosphere less statically\nstable and leads to faster updrafts [50], but it does\ndemonstrate that changes in the static stability asso-\nciated with subdaily extreme precipitation events are\nworthy of further study. In a related result, tempera-\nture changes in climate-change simulations were found\nto be close to constant in the vertical for high-CAPE\ncomposites in the midlatitudes [50,7].\nAs discussed in section 3, updrafts do become some-\nwhat faster with warming when lapse rates are allowed\nto equilibrate (rather than being imposed) in simula-\ntions of RCE, although the dynamical contribution to\nchanges in precipitation extremes is still relatively small\n[70,56,77]. Nonetheless, large deviations from Clausius-\nClapeyron scaling have been found in a study of RCE\nbecause of changes in precipitation efficiency at mean\nsurface temperatures below 295K [77]. The 99.99th per-\ncentile of precipitation from this study is shown in Fig. 3a\nfor durations from instantaneous to daily.4 Warming\nshifts the percentile curves upwards in intensity in Fig. 3a,\nbut the rate at which they shift upwards varies with\nduration and temperature. As shown in Fig. 3b, the\nprecipitation extremes follow Clausius-Clapeyron scal-\ning at roughly 6-7% K\u22121 for temperatures above 295K.\nHowever, for temperatures below 295K the sensitivity\nvaries widely depending on temperature and accumu-\nlation period in a manner that is not fully understood.\nInstantaneous precipitation extremes increase at close\nto double the Clausius-Clapeyron rate for temperatures\nbelow 295K, and this has been shown to be due to in-\ncreases in precipitation efficiency with warming, related\nin part to increases in hydrometeor fall speed as more\nof the precipitation in the column changes from solid\nto liquid [77]. Such changes in precipitation efficiency\nmight be expected to occur for variability within a cli-\nmate as well as for longer term climate change, but in\nthe simulations they depend strongly on the choice of\ncloud microphysics scheme, and it remains to be seen if\nthey are relevant for observed precipitation extremes.\n8 Conclusions and open questions\nAs demonstrated in several observational studies, there\nhas been an overall intensification of daily precipita-\ntion extremes as a result of global warming, although\nthe available data has limited geographic coverage, and\nthere are large regional variations in the observed trends.\nMuch of the characterization of projected changes in\nprecipitation extremes comes from climate models that\nuse parameterized moist convection, but these are not\nexpected to be reliable for precipitation extremes that\nare primarily convective in nature (for example, in the\ntropics or for certain events in summer in the extrat-\nropics). As a result, simulations that use cloud-system\nresolving models or superparameterizations are becom-\ning increasingly important to research in this area. Even\nwhen convective dynamics are resolved, precipitation\nextremes at short durations have been found to be sen-\nsitive to the parameterization of cloud and precipita-\ntion microphysics [77], and progress in observations and\nphysical understanding remains equally important.\nContributions from changes in thermodynamics, dy-\nnamics, and precipitation efficiency have all been found\nto be important for changes in precipitation extremes in\nat least some situations in modeling studies. The ther-\nmodynamic contribution is the easiest to understand\nand always gives an intensification with warming. There\n4 Percentiles are calculated including zero precipitation\namounts, and the simulations have 500m horizontal grid spac-\ning and use the cloud microphysics scheme referred to as \u201cLin-\nhail\u201d in [77].\nPrecipitation extremes under climate change 9\nis some basic understanding of dynamical contributions\nat the large-scale from the omega equation (section 4.1)\nand also at the convective scale in the case of RCE (sec-\ntions 3 and 7), but only a few studies have focussed on\nthe role of mesoscale convective organization in precip-\nitation extremes [72,79,55].\nPrecipitation extremes associated with particular dy-\nnamical regimes or particular precipitation types may\nrespond differently to climate warming and are deserv-\ning of special attention. As discussed in section 5, recent\nidealized studies of orographic precipitation extremes\nhave found that fractional increases are larger on the\nclimatological leeward side than on the windward side,\nand further work is needed to relate this to more realis-\ntic modeling studies and observations. Similarly, snow-\nfall extremes behave quite differently from rainfall ex-\ntremes because they tend to occur near an optimal tem-\nperature that is unaffected by climate warming. Further\nwork is needed to understand the specific responses of\nlake-effect and high-elevation snowfall extremes, as well\nas changes in the frequency of hail and ice storms [14,\n16].\nCharacterizing the dependence of changes in precip-\nitation extremes on duration is of importance for im-\npacts, and this is particularly challenging for subdaily\ndurations. Much research has focussed on precipitation\naccumulated over fixed time periods as discussed in sec-\ntion 7. An alternative approach is to consider proper-\nties of contiguous precipitation events that are defined\nbased on when non-zero precipitation begins and ends\n[68,71,10]. Consideration of the amount of precipitation\nin a given event (the event depth) may be advantageous\nbecause observed distributions of event depths exhibit\na power law range [68,81] and thus their response to\nclimate change may be relatively simple to character-\nize.\nDaily precipitation extremes in the tropics seem to\nbe more sensitive to climate warming than those in the\nextratropics, as suggested by results from both rain-\ngauge observations (section 2) and climate-model pro-\njections constrained using satellite observations (section\n4.2). One possible cause is a more positive dynami-\ncal contribution in the tropics than the extratropics.\nChanges in extratropical eddy kinetic energy are rel-\natively modest and can be either positive or negative\ndepending on season and hemisphere [57], whereas in-\ncreases in the frequency of the most intense tropical cy-\nclones are expected as the climate warms [42], and trop-\nical cyclones contribute substantially to off-equatorial\nprecipitation extremes in the current climate [45]. Fur-\nthermore, increases in the activity of the Madden-Julian\nOscillation and convectively-coupled equatorial Kelvin\nwaves have been found in simulations with conventional\nand superparameterized climate models [12,5]. The in-\nfluence of these potential dynamical changes on the ag-\ngregate statistics of tropical precipitation extremes re-\nmains to be assessed.\nConflict of interest statement\nThe author states that there is no conflict of interest.\nAcknowledgements Thanks to Martin Singh, Bill Boos,\nMarkus Donat, Lisa Alexander, and an anonymous referee\nfor helpful comments and to Justin Gillis for alerting me\nto some early papers.

Data J.

For the period prior to the 1960s there are\nmany more non-digitised land climate records than\ndigitised globally and even after that decade not all\nthe observed climate variables are routinely digitised\nand readily available particularly at the \ufb01nest time\nscales (e.g. sub-daily and daily) or are of adequate\nquality and reasonably free of inhomogeneities so that\nthey may be con\ufb01dently used in any climate-related\nassessment or for the generation of climate products\nand services. Most of the land meteorological observa-\ntions recorded in the past are only available in hard\ncopy or imaged form and, therefore, they are unus-\nable for climatic studies or for the development of\ntimely and useful climate services or decadal climate\npredictions. These are some of the demands for\nclimate products and services, which are nowadays\nrequired by society to better detect, predict and to\nrespond to the challenges posed by climate variability\nand man-made climate change (WMO, 2011).\nLong land instrumental records are key elements of\ninformation on the past states of the climate system,\nwhich contain invaluable clues on historical climate\nvariations, along with the factors that could in\ufb02uence\nthem (Br\u20aconnimann et al., 2005; Allan et al., 2011;\nBrunet & Jones, 2011; Thorne et al., 2011b). These\nclimate time series are, therefore, the basis of climate\nresearch, which brings important scienti\ufb01c and socio-\neconomic bene\ufb01ts. Today a number of socioeconomic\nand political alternatives rely on the accuracy and reli-\nability of accessible and traceable climate products and\nservices, which are derived in turn from digitised, high-\nquality, long-term, and traceable climate time series.\nThis underpins the need for rescuing these historical\nclimate assets and bringing long-term and high-quality\nclimate time series into the 21st century making this a\nmatter of paramount scienti\ufb01c and societal interest.\nThe reduced availability and accessibility to long\nand reliable climate time series is even more striking\nCopyright \u00aa 2013 The Authors.

Besides, the GMR is\nregarded as a climate change hot spot (Giorgi, 2006;\nDiffenbaugh et al., 2007) and the International Panel\non Climate Change (IPCC, 2007) report has stressed\nthe possibility of warmer and drier conditions in the\nnear future leading to more frequent and prolonged\ndroughts, as well as to longer \ufb01re season and intensi-\n\ufb01ed \ufb01re risk (Alcamo et al., 2007). In this regard, the\nGMR socioecosystems are particularly vulnerable to in-\nterannual (and longer timescale) climate variability.\nThese impacts reinforce the need to strengthen our\nknowledge of spatial and temporal patterns of climate\nvariability, and their related causal mechanisms, across\nthe GMR.\nThe Mediterranean countries have a very long and\nrich monitoring history in the atmospheric domain,\ngoing back in time several centuries in some countries\n(i.e. Italy, France, Spain) and at least to the mid-19th\ncentury onwards across much of the region. However,\navailable digital climate data are mostly restricted to\nthe last third of the 20th century onwards, but their\naccessibility is restricted due to economic or political\nissues that rule out much data sharing, despite World\nMeteorological Organization (WMO) Resolution 40\n(WMO Cg-XII, 1995). The existing surface climate data\nheritage is largely underexploited.\nEnhancing availability, accessibility and traceability\nto historical climate time series over a climate change\nhot spot region (such as the GMR is considered),\nwhose socioecosystems are very sensitive to climate\nchange and where its potential impacts are large\nbrings a number of scienti\ufb01c and societal bene\ufb01ts.\nHigh-quality (i.e. quality controlled and homogenised),\nhigh-resolution (both in time and space) and long-\nterm (longer than centennial scale) climate time series\nare the basic and key input for undertaking more\nrobust climate analysis or for generating any climate\nservice, product and application.\nTo locate, organise, assess, and preserve data\nsources is the \ufb01rst step to be taken prior de\ufb01ning or\nundertaking any plan to digitise historical record and\nsubject the digitised series to quality controls, looking\nto identify non-systematic errors, homogeneity testing\nto assess systematic biases or for homogenising if\ninhomogeneities are found and the accompanying\nmetadata provide clues for validating and adjusting\nthe identi\ufb01ed breakpoints in homogeneity.\nThis article is aimed at documenting relevant histori-\ncal data owners/holders and data sources containing\nMediterranean climate data and metadata in non-digi-\ntal format especially for the poorest documented Medi-\nterranean parts, the southern and Middle East regions.\nIts emphasis is the investigation of online repositories\nworldwide and the French archives holdings, compris-\ning data over France and overseas. An exemplar case\nstudy will look at the Algerian holdings one of the\npoorest documented world region: the northern Afri-\ncan sub-region, and describes some of the past and\nongoing data rescue (DARE) initiatives that are\nimproving availability, accessibility and traceability of\nhistorical climate data over the GMR.\nThe article is organised as follows: historical climate\ndata sources and holders, both online repositories and\nphysical archives, are explored \ufb01rst splitting the sec-\ntion into three parts focused on the following: (a) rele-\nvant online repositories worldwide containing historical\nclimate data for southern and Middle East Mediterra-\nnean countries, (b) the French archives and holdings\ncomprising not only historical climate data over France\nbut also for its past colonies in North Africa, and\n(c) the ongoing DARE program set up by the Algerian\nNMS as a case study. The second section is devoted\nto a discussion of ongoing DARE initiatives supported\nby international, European, and national bodies, while\nthe last section summarises the study and provides\nsome concluding remarks.\n1. Exploring Mediterranean climate data\nsources and holders\nDespite the rich heritage of historical surface climate\ndata and although some NMSs and academic institu-\ntions have recently undertaken DARE activities aimed\nat transferring historical climate records from fragile\nmedia (paper forms) to new media (imaging), few of\nthe necessary long-term records are readily available\nin digital form. Furthermore, the requirement for high-\nquality integrated climate products is impeding the\ndevelopment of optimum strategies to mitigate and/or\nadapt to the negative impacts of global climate\nchange over the Mediterranean Basin. This stems from\nthe lack of long-term digital records.\nHowever, recently the digitisation (scanning) of col-\nlections of documents with meteorological/climatic\ndata provides the opportunity to extend climatic stud-\nies to earlier periods. This section \ufb01rst explores world-\nwide online repositories containing relevant historical\nclimate data that can be employed for extending back\nin time reliable climate records over the GMR and, in\nthe second, insights are provided into the holdings\nkept at French archives. The section ends with the\nassessment of the DARE activities undertaken by the\nAlgerian NMS.\n1.1 Online repositories of historical climate\ndata of interest for the GMR\nSigni\ufb01cant fractions of historical surface climate data\nkept in hard copies (e.g. meteorological collections,\nsuch as monthly bulletins and annual reports, mono-\ngraphs, observatories reports) thanks to the general-\nised exchange of meteorological data that took place\nduring the 19th century and earlier among scienti\ufb01c\ninstitutions have been and are being imaged and\nentered into online repositories as a result of various\n2 M. Brunet et al.\nGeoscience Data Journal 0: 1\u201313 (2013) Copyright \u00aa 2013 The Authors\nefforts and initiatives. Climatic research for the GMR\nhas been restricted to periods back to the mid-20th\ncentury, although a large disparity in the spatial\ncoverage of the observational networks used can be\nhighlighted, with the lowest spatial and temporal cov-\nerage over Southern and Middle East Mediterranean\ncountries.\nNowadays, the largest online repository of world-\nwide imaged meteorological/climatological data from\ndifferent sources is available from the United States\nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\n(NOAA)/National Climate Data Center (NCDC)/Climate\nData Modernization Program (CDMP: http://www.\nncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/cdmp/cdmp.html), which\ncontains about 56 millions of images (~9 Tb) from a\ndiverse number of climate sources around the world.\nThe CDMP has scanned a multitude of collections of\ndata, maps and descriptions of meteorological settings\n(with emphasis on intense meteorological events) and\nmade them available to the public (http://docs.lib.\nnoaa.gov/rescue/data_rescue_home.html). For the\nsouthern Mediterranean, these documents are reports/\nassessments issued by local meteorological services,\ninitially organised by European ex-colonial countries\nsuch as France and Italy, and in many cases constitute\ncomponents of multi-country meteorological collec-\ntions published by European countries.\nAnother web-repository is maintained by BADC\n(the British Atmospheric Data Centre; being available\nat http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/browse/badc/corral/images/\nmetobs) and comprises images of data-pages scanned\nin the framework of Atmospheric Circulation Recon-\nstructions over the Earth Initiative (ACRE: http://www.\nmet-acre.org/) from various sources of historical\nweather observations (mainly from the \u2018Climatological\nReturns\u2019 and \u2018Daily Weather Reports\u2019), which are\nheld by the National Meteorological Archives of the\nUK Met Of\ufb01ce (http://www.metof\ufb01ce.gov.uk/corporate/\nlibrary/). For the southern Mediterranean, a handful of\ndaily climate series for Cyprus, Egypt and Morocco are\navailable from BADC.\nFor both CDMP and BADC data repositories, the\nmost extensive southern Mediterranean sites are for\nmajor towns/cities, e.g. Oran, Algiers, Tunis, Cairo,\nBeirut, Nicosia (from 1870s up to 1970s). Meteorologi-\ncal records were taken at observatories, civil/military\nadministration buildings, hospitals, hotels, sea ports,\nand airports. However, rural and remote places were\nalso covered by stations set up by the various state\nmeteorological services to cover the whole territory of\ntheir country/region (often sparsely, but particularly\ndensely in agricultural regions, i.e. the Nile Delta), and\nalso where companies, services and foreign missions\nwere activated such as construction companies (e.g.\nSuez Canal), lighthouses (semaphores), educational\ninstitutions (schools/universities), etc.\nData from all these sorts of stations can be found in\nthe online repositories, either at daily/sub-daily\nresolution and also as annual tables of monthly-mean\nvalues of speci\ufb01c meteorological parameters: morning\ntemperature and sea level pressure (SLP) recordings,\ndaily precipitation totals, and often daily maximum,\nminimum, dew-point, and sub-daily temperatures,\nsub-daily and mean daily SLP records, vapour pres-\nsure, humidity, evaporation, cloudiness, sunshine dura-\ntion, wind direction and strength, description of the\ndaily weather state (often the sea state too), and ref-\nerences on speci\ufb01c phenomena: dew and frost inci-\ndents, fogs, storms, heavy rainfall, hail, characteristic\nwinds (e.g. sirocco/ghibli).\nThe overall daily-data coverage for the southern\nMediterranean is summarised in Tables 1 and 2. The\nvarious data book collections are provided, together\nwith the countries and periods covered. Note that\nseveral data gaps are found within the earliest and\nlatest years mentioned, and these gaps could be of\ndaily, monthly, annual, or multi-annual length. The\nWorld War II period 1941\u20131944 is a common\ndata-poor interval. However, monthly data summaries\n(often constituting year-round monthly-means of\ncertain meteorological parameters) are provided for\nmore stations than the daily-scale documented\nstations and extend in periods not covered by daily\nrecords.\nUnder the framework of the European Union (EU)-\nfunded EUropean Reanalysis and Observations for (4)\nMonitoring (EURO4M: http://www.euro4m.eu/index.\nhtml) project in connection with the WMO/MEditerra-\nnean DAta REscue (MEDARE) Initiative (http://www.\nomm.urv.cat/MEDARE/index.html) data are being digi-\ntised and long series reconstructed from long daily\nmaximum and minimum temperatures and precipita-\ntion totals, along with sub-daily data for surface air\npressure over North African and Middle East Mediter-\nranean countries. Figure 1 gives details of the loca-\ntions and variables being digitised, quality controlled\nand homogenised after the records are merged with\nrecent parts of the data recorded by the relevant\nMediterranean NMSs, while Table 3 gives a detailed\naccount of the stations, variables and periods recov-\nered, digitised and quality controlled at the daily scale\nfor temperature (maxima and minima) and precipita-\ntion (daily amounts) and at the sub-daily scales for air\nsurface pressure parameters.\nThis DARE exercise, enabled by the European Com-\nmission funds, will extend further back in time some\nof the longest surface temperature, precipitation and\nair pressure time series at the daily and sub-daily\nscales, respectively, which will allow scientists and pol-\nicy-makers analyses to assess climate variability and\nchange impacts over one of the poorest documented\nregions of the world. The EURO4M project intend to\nalso share the data rescued under this effort with\nappropriate global and regional databanks [e.g.\nECA&D (European Climate Assessment and Dataset),\nCRU (Climatic Research Unit \u2013data sets), ISTI (Inter-\nnational Surface Temperature Initiative)], as has been\nthe case for a set of air pressure records already\nprovided to the ISPD (International Surface Pressure\nDatabank). However, note that this exercise for\nMediterranean climate data sources 3\nCopyright \u00aa 2013 The Authors Geoscience Data Journal 0: 1\u201313 (2013)\nrecovering and bringing long-term and high-quality cli-\nmate variables into the future only encompasses three\nof the measured climate variables, while the other\nclimatic parameters contained in the sources will\nremain undigitised until some other opportunity for\ndigitising them emerge. Therefore, there is still much\nscope for undertaking further DARE activities for the\nsouthern Mediterranean sub-region.\nTable 1.

Regular meteorological\ninstrumental measurements have been recorded since\nthe end of the 17th century onwards. Instrumental\nobservations have been carried out by astronomers,\ndoctors, Jesuits during the 17th and the 18th centuries\n(Jourdain et al., 2008). In the 19th century the obser-\nvations were organised by several institutions and\nadministrations (e.g. Education Ministry through pri-\nmary schools and observatories networks, Public\nWorks Ministry for \ufb02ood warning, lighthouses and river\nnavigation networks, Telegraph with the le Verrier tele-\ngraphic network) and the Navy with the semaphore\nnetwork and meteorological association (Fierro, 1991;\nLocher, 2008).\nFrench climate data are consequently hidden in\nmany places in France. Today the most important hold-\nings for earlier climate instrumental data are as follows:\nM\u0001et\u0001eo-France as the NMS in France responsible for\nclimate data recording and archiving. Other institutions\nalso keep historical climate data, such as archive insti-\ntutions (i.e. national, territorial, departmental, and local\narchives), scienti\ufb01c institution archives (e.g. Academy\nof Sciences, Academy of Medicine, research centres,\nuniversities, learned societies), local and national\nlibraries, the Ministry of Defence archives and from\nother several governmental administrations.\nPichard and Roucaute (2009) explore in their study\nthe availability of historical climate data for the Prov-\nence Department (located in southern France and\nbelonging to the Mediterranean region) and state that\nscienti\ufb01c archives in France are disseminated in a \u2018plei-\nade\u2019 of institutions with their own status and methods\nof preservation. Auffray et al. (2009) also illustrates\nthe dif\ufb01culties in recovering and gathering data of\nclimate extreme events due to the wide dispersion\nof sources in France.\nThe following epigraphs illustrate the most impor-\ntant holdings of French instrumental climate data.\nFirst, a description is provided of a selection of hold-\nings for the 17th and 18th centuries; followed by the\nM\u0001et\u0001eo-France data holdings extending back to 1800\nand ends with the description exploring some of the\ndepartmental archives (italics are used for the French\nnames of institutions).\n1.2.1 Historical sources extending back to the\nearly 18th century\nFrom the French Institute Library (Librairie de l\u2019Insti-\ntut de France). The manuscripts of the \ufb01rst French\ninstrumental oldest climate series made by Morin 1665\n\u20131709 in Paris is stored in this library (quotation Ms\n1488). The manuscripts were imaged by the Institut\nde France. These pressure data have recently been\nanalysed by Cornes et al. (2012) developing a long\nseries (but with a few gaps) to the present.\nFrom the Academy of Medicine Library (Librairie de\nl\u2019Acad\u0001emie de M\u0001edecine). The Royal Society of Med-\nicine in Paris created a meteorological network in 1776\nand it continued until 1792. More than 200 doctors\nsent their daily observations to L. Cotte. The collection\nof the records, 13 800 pages of weather reports on\ndaily basis over France, is kept in the Library archives.\nThe meteorological collection has been imaged thanks\nto the French-funded project ANR-CHEDAR. The\nimages are accessible via internet from the Academy\nof Medicine website: http://www.academie-medecine.\nfr/user\ufb01les/\ufb01le/SRM/index.html. The next step, man-\naged by M\u0001et\u0001eo-France, will be the digitisation of the\ndata for relevant climate series.\nFrom Marseille Observatory (Observatoire Astrono-\nmique de Marseille-Provence \u2013 OAMP \u2013). The Mar-\nseille Observatory (OAMP) holds observations recorded\nin the Marseille observatories since 1761 and the data\nregistered by Catelin le Cadet (1744\u20131787). A precise\ninventory of this asset is available at http://www.\noamp.fr/patrimoine/archives-f.html. Micro\ufb01lms of this\ncollection are available at the departmental archives\nFigure 1.

These Daily\nClimate Reports, however, remained in the former\ncolonies.\nNorth African former colonies records in micro\ufb01lms:\nThe collection concerns 74 synoptic stations: TCM for\nTunisia and Morocco from 1923 to 1962, TCM and\nCRQ for Algeria from 1924 to 1966, but with a big gap\nbetween 1937 and 1944.\n1.2.4 National Archives (Archives Nationales)\nThe National Archives (AN) is a governmental agency\nin charge of preserving and communicating all infor-\nmation produced by the French Government and its\nadministration. The Fontainebleau site mainly keeps\narchives going back in time to 1850.\nIn line with the French Public Archives Law, M\u0001et\u0001eo-\nFrance deposited around 6300 boxes of climate and\nweather documents at the National Archives between\n1976 and 1992. The Directorate of Climatology man-\naged the deposit of 4287 boxes. A good idea of the\ncontent of these holdings is guaranteed thanks to the\ndeposit forms delivered when archives were trans-\nferred. Boxes contain original manuscript of weather\nreports from 1800 to 1989 from surface and upper air\nstations for mainland France, French overseas and\nex-colonies and from ships. The Table 4 gives details\non the different collections.\nAccess to the documents was precluded during the\n\ufb01rst decade of the 21st century due to asbestos\npresence in the archives. A new project co-funded by\nFoundation BNP Paribas and managed by M\u0001et\u0001eo-\nFrance and Archives Nationales started last year,\nwhich has as goals to clean up the archives from\nasbestos, to give full access to the archives in the\nbest environment possible, to inventory and in detail\nassess the meteorological sources and its data\ncontent and digitise relevant documents and\nobservations.\n1.2.5 Departmental archives\nDepartmental public archives are in charge of the con-\nservation and the communication of the documents\nproduced by departmental administrations in France.\nThe territorial separation of some administrations (e.g.\nEquipments, Education, Telegraphs, M\u0001et\u0001eo-France)\nand the Public Archives Law has the effect of dissemi-\nnating meteorological sources in all the departmental\narchives and different collections. These archives\ncontain plenty of precipitation measurements, making\nthem very useful and essential for \ufb02ood studies\n(Naulet et al., 2001).\n1.3 The Algerian NMS DARE program: an\nexample to follow and learn from\nThe recovery, digitisation and reconstruction of the\nrich heritage of weather observations recorded in\nAlgeria from the mid-19th century onwards is being\nexplored through a related initiative carried out by the\nOf\ufb01ce National de la M\u0001et\u0001eorologie (Algerian NMS).\nThis initiative has enabled the recovery of a dense net-\nwork of precipitation time series at different temporal\nscales (from daily to monthly) for use in climate moni-\ntoring and prediction assessments and in the produc-\ntion of climate services, which will be useful for the\nnational climate change adaptation program. Lessons\nlearnt by the Algerian NMS related to the interopera-\nbility of the tools employed in its DARE program are\nworth discussing as they will prove useful to other\ncountries. Both aspects are the focus of this sub-sec-\ntion.\nAs early as the \ufb01rst computer was purchased by the\nAlgerian NMS in the 1970s and climate data manage-\nment systems and other hardware and software were\navailable thanks to the international cooperation fos-\ntered by the WMO Voluntary Cooperation Programme,\nthe Climatological Branch started both the digitalisa-\ntion and quality control of its recent weather observa-\ntions and an early DARE program aimed at locating,\norganising and preserving the national historical assets\nand to image and digitise some of these assets for\nsome of the essential climate variables (i.e. surface\ntemperature and precipitation) measured anywhere at\nany time and date in the Algerian territory.\nThe recovery effort \ufb01rst emphasised the digitisation\nand quality control of the observations for 50 synoptic\nstations for the period 1953\u20131991, which include all\nTable 4.

The digi-\ntised data were recorded and kept on magnetic tapes\nfrom the mid-1970s to early-1990s. These required\nlater transfer of the data onto currently operable sys-\ntems. From the mid- to late-1980s, the availability of\nnew climate data management systems, such as the\nFrench DataStar (digitisation of precipitation and tem-\nperature) and the WMO/CLICOM (for digitising synop-\ntic data before 1953 and after 1991) systems enabled\nthe digitisation of the main and climatological stations\nfor the six Algerian meteorological regions, which were\nthen sent to the central climatological branch for qual-\nity control in delayed mode.\nA problem with the digitised data related to the\nnon-interoperability of the media where the data\nwere kept (NORKS DATA) turned out to be a very\ntime-consuming and intensive task. Transferring\n1663 years of data from the 50 stations was\nrequired and this took 30 months of work. This\npoints to the need to refresh the storage media as\nsoon as new technology is available or at least every\n10 years as recommended in the WMO guidance on\nclimate DARE (Tan et al., 2004). The task was com-\npleted between 1999 and 2001.\nFrom 2000, a preservation and scanning effort of\nold historical data sources (e.g. the existing TCM and\nCRQ collections in the country \u2013 see Table 4 for\ndetails) was and is being carried out, since the micro-\n\ufb01lming of old data initiated in 1985 did not return suf-\n\ufb01ciently clear copies and was another time-consuming\ntask. The old manuscripts and data sources were or-\nganised and archived before 2003 in the Oran archive\nand after that date in the Algiers national archives,\nallowing the centralisation of the historical sources\nkept in the country in a central archive that made it\nmuch easy to develop an inventory and ensure preser-\nvation.\nThe effort was and is being concentrated on the\ndigitisation and quality controlling of a dense network\nof precipitation stations (about 790 rain gauge sites;\n~25 of them going back in time to the mid 19th cen-\ntury, ~220 starting in the late 19th century, ~350\nbeginning around the early 20th century and the\nremaining from the 1960s and later). Figure 2 pro-\nvides details (i.e. location and approximate length of\nthe records) of the precipitation network that has\nbeen digitised and is being quality controlled by the\nClimatological Branch at the Algerian NMS.\nAt present, the DARE program has also scanned a\nlarge number of documents (272K daily reports with\nfour images per day) containing climate daily data for\n17 stations for the period 1949\u20132002, although it is\nstill pending the scanning of the TCM source and other\nmanuscripts with the oldest data sources for Algiers\nstation with records going back to 1856. The effort is\nalso being \ufb01rst put on digitising precipitation data\n(about 300 rain gauge stations have been digitised for\ndifferent periods) and these records are being quality\ncontrolled to identify non-systematic bias in the series.\nFigure 2. Location map of the Algerian precipitation network being recovered and quality controlled by the climatological branch\nat the Algerian NMS providing the approximate length of the records.\nMediterranean climate data sources 9\nCopyright \u00aa 2013 The Authors Geoscience Data Journal 0: 1\u201313 (2013)\nAnother effort carried out in parallel is a detailed\ninventorying of the rest of climatic variables on a\nmonthly basis. Once \ufb01nished, it will allow the Algerian\nNMS to undertake the digitisation and quality control\nof these data.\nDespite constraints related to scarce human and\ntechnological resources at the Algerian NMS Climato-\nlogical Branch and frequent changes in computer sys-\ntems or software and the problems posed by de\ufb01cient\ninfrastructural capabilities, it is an exemplar to look at\nnational DARE programs focused not only on making\navailable current and historical weather observations\nbut also to organise, inventory and preserve historical\nassets. This DARE program exempli\ufb01es both the dif\ufb01-\nculties encountered and hopefully will encourage other\nNMS in the region to follow the Algerian NMS effort.\n2. Past and ongoing DARE activities over\nthe GMR\nThe scarcity of long-term and high-quality climate\nrecords over the GMR is clearly made visible in many\nrecent climatic studies (e.g. Xoplaki et al., 2003,\n2004; Kostopoulou & Jones, 2007a,b; Kuglitsch et al.,\n2009, 2010; Hertig et al., 2010; Toreti et al., 2010),\nwhere different aspects of climate variability have\nbeen assessed using surface instrumental records.\nFigure 3 shows an example of the limited availability\nof long climate records over the GMR. The network of\nMediterranean stations with maximum temperature\nrecords on a daily basis used in the study of Kuglitsch\net al. (2009), whose time series were subjected by\nthe authors to a homogenisation exercise to use the\nhomogenised data in future climatic research over the\nGMR, is a clear example illustrating this shortcoming.\nFigure 3 clearly shows the highly limited number of\nrecords in time (covering the last 50\u2013100 years, but\nwith more than half of the total stations, 174, just\nextending from 1940 onwards) and space (stations\nmainly located over northern, western and eastern\nparts of the GMR), which is particularly poignant over\nsouthern and Middle East Mediterranean countries.\nAgainst this shortcoming, several activities at the\ninternational, European and national scales have been\nrecently set up with the aim of enhancing climate data\navailability and accessibility over the GMR. This section\nassesses some of them, with the focus put on the\nWMO/MEDARE Initiative and other regional/European\nprojects and initiatives.\nNot only due to the disturbing lack of climate data\nbut also to the urgent need for providing high-quality\nand long climate data to stakeholders (e.g. scientists\nand policy-makers), the WMO/MEDARE Initiative was\nde\ufb01ned and agreed at the \ufb01rst WMO International\nWorkshop on Climate Data Rescue in the Mediterra-\nnean Basin (Tarragona, November 2007: http://www.\nomm.urv.cat/medare-tarragona/index.html) and was\nendorsed by the WMO Executive Council (EC)-60\n(June 2008: http://www.omm.urv.cat/MEDARE/endo\nrsement.html). The WMO/MEDARE Initiative aims to\nenhance climate data availability and accessibility over\nthe GMR through promoting DARE activities among\ntheir members: the MEDARE Community (http://www.\nomm.urv.cat/MEDARE/medare-community.html), which\nbrings together scientists from most of the Mediterra-\nnean NMSs, universities and research centres world-\nwide.\nAmong other recent organisational, dissemination,\ncooperation and raising awareness activities (Brunet,\n2012), the MEDARE Community has set up a metadata\nportal (http://app.omm.urv.cat/urv/), which is being\npopulated by the MEDARE Community with metadata\nfor the longest and key climate records selected on a\nnational basis. Up to 656 past and current observing\nsites from which key climate variables (e.g. surface\ntemperature, precipitation, air pressure) are docu-\nmented and available. Table 5 gives details of the total\nnumber of observing sites for which metadata exists\nin the MEDARE meta database and also provides the\nnumber of stations at the ECA&D (http://eca.knmi.nl/)\nproject for comparison purposes with an emphasis on\nthe southern Mediterranean and Middle East.\nThe MEDARE meta database gives information on\nstation identi\ufb01ers (i.e. local and WMO codes), geo-\nFigure 3.

This information is being used by\nMEDARE members to target the longest climate\nrecords to be reconstructed (i.e. digitised, quality con-\ntrolled and homogenised) under the umbrella of this\nWMO Initiative either at regional and sub-regional or\nnational scales. In this regard and in connection with\nthe EU-funded EURO4M project, 77 (82) maximum\nand minimum temperatures (precipitation) series are\nbeing reconstructed at the daily scale and 43 surface\nair pressure series at the sub-daily scale over the\npoorest documented Mediterranean regions of North\nAfrica and Middle East, as shown in Figure 2, which\nwill complement, extend back in time and signi\ufb01cantly\nincrease currently available stations at the ECA&D\nproject over these regions.\nThe ECA&D project is one of the past and ongoing\nefforts for making available and accessible daily Euro-\npean climate observations for climate research, which\nis aimed at combining collations of observations at\nmeteorological stations, analysing climate extremes\nand disseminating both the data and the resulting\nanalysis. The current data set has been being contrib-\nuted to by NMS and other projects and initiatives since\nits inception in 1998 and includes 4824 (26 112)\nmeteorological stations (climate series) for 62 coun-\ntries, which are provided by 58 participants (http://\neca.knmi.nl/). This project is improving accessibility to\nhigh-quality climate series, which is mainly due to the\ninvolvement of most of the NMSs operating in the\nECA&D European window (http://eca.knmi.nl/coun-\ntries/country_overview.php). At present, the network\nof participants is being gradually extended to countries\nin the Middle East and North Africa, which is expected\nto result in a dramatically increased climate data avail-\nability and accessibility at the \ufb01nest time scales for this\nregion in conjunction with the EURO4M project and\nWMO/MEDARE Initiative efforts.\nSeveral other initiatives attempting to directly or indi-\nrectly increase data availability or their accessibility are\nworth to mention. Thanks to the EU-funded Climate\nChange and Impact Research: the Mediterranean\nEnvironment (CIRCE) integrated project, a handful of\nsouthern Mediterranean climate series [i.e. for seven\n(six) Tunisian (Moroccan) locations have been added\ncovering most of the 20th century for a few of the\nlongest records]. Recently and under the framework of\na local DARE project funded by the University of Giessen\nin Germany and supported by the ACRE Initiative to\nincrease availability and accessibility of long historical\nobservations series from Mediterranean and Middle East\n(Xoplaki et al., 2012), four sites where air pressure,\ntemperature and rainfall were measured since the late\n18th and mid-19th centuries are being recovered,\nimaged, digitised and quality controlled.\nFinally, a number of projects aimed at the establish-\nment of data repositories or the implementation of\nhigh-performance computing (HPC) systems in the\nEastern Mediterranean region have been recently set\nup. The EU-funded DARECLIMED project aims to iden-\ntify, rescue, collect and disseminate regional data sets\nof interest for the climate, water and energy sectors\nover the eastern Mediterranean region through estab-\nlishing a network of partners that have access to, own\nor have collected relevant data and implement a regio-\nnal infrastructure for climate research (http://www.cyi.\nac.cy/index.php/dareclimed-welcome.html). Another\nproject, aimed at the implementation of a HPC eco-\nsystem interlinking and coordinating regional comput-\ning, storage and visualisation resources to implement\nan integrated e-infrastructure, is the LinkSCEEM-2 pro-\nject (http://www.linksceem.eu/ls2/project/about-us.\nhtml). It is expected that both projects improve data\naccessibility over the Eastern Mediterranean, a region\nwhere the need for long climate data is crucial.\n3. Concluding remarks\nDespite the wealthy heritage of historical climate\nrecords that have been taken across the GMR since\nthe inception of instrumental data, current availability\nand accessibility to long-term and high-quality climate\nseries are still largely inadequate. This shortcoming is\nimpeding scienti\ufb01c progress on climate variability and\nchange, along with its impacts in the Mediterranean\nsocio-ecosystems, and it is obstructing the de\ufb01nition\nof the best strategies to adapt the countries to current\nand future climate change effects.\nTable 5.

This is the largest reposi-\ntory of worldwide climatological data sources, which\nhas recently seen a dramatic cut in funding in the 2012\n\ufb01nancial exercise that could put in peril this valuable\nUS-program. Also, the BADC repository and its potential\nfor long climate DARE and reconstruction has been\npresented. Special emphasis has been placed on the\nFrench online and physical holdings containing not only\nFrench-mainland data, but also overseas former colonial\ndata over the GMR with the focus put on southern and\nMiddle East Mediterranean countries.\nSeveral initiatives and projects intending to increase\nclimate data availability and accessibility over the GMR\nhave been analysed. The WMO/MEDARE Initiative\nalong with the EU-funded EURO4M project have been\nthe focus, since both ongoing activities in the DARE\n\ufb01eld are making valuable forward steps for ensuring\nthat the rich heritage of Mediterranean climate records\nis not lost forever. Other EU- and national-funded pro-\njects have been also assessed. Some of the examples\nused in the article suggest that good coordination\namong data producers/holders (i.e. NMSs) and schol-\nars (i.e. research centres, universities) in the DARE\narena brings improved results when considering\nenhancing and accessing to crucial historical climate\ndata that remain in unusable formats.\nThe analyses have shown the need and potential\nfor continuing to promote and carry out DARE activi-\nties over this climate change hot spot and have given\nthe necessary details pointing to the relevant climate\ndata sources and holders. It has also assessed current\nefforts for recovering our historical climate past. Only\nafter reconstructing long-term and high-quality climate\nseries will it be possible to decipher what the long\ninstrumental climate series can provide about past cli-\nmate variations and the factors forcing them.\nAcknowledgements\nManola Brunet, Phil Jones and Dimitrios Efthymiadis\nthank the EU-funded project EURO4M (FP7-SPACE-\n2009-1 Project No. 242093).

The eruptionimmediately killed thousands of people on Sumbawa.During the following months, tens of thousands diedof starvation and disease on Sumbawa and neighbor-ing islands. The gas plume of this enormous eruption,the largest since the 1257 Samalas eruption (shownas Rinjani in Figure 1), produced stratosphericsulfate aerosols that shielded incoming solar radiationover the following 3 years.1 The aerosols led to a sub-stantial annual cooling of the Tropics and the extra-tropical Northern Hemisphere by approximately0.4\u20130.8\u0001C relative to the preceding 30 years.2\u20134 Thefollowing year, 1816, went down in history as a\u2018Year without a Summer,5\u20137 resulting in large socio-economic impacts such as crop failures and associ-ated famines, across the Northern Hemisphere,including China, North America, and Europe.8\u201311Given these worldwide impacts, the Tambora erup-tion must be considered to have had one of the great-est death tolls attributed to a volcanic eruption.The Tambora eruption and its climatic conse-quences were studied repeatedly over the past centurywith respect to diverse research questions rangingfrom ice age theory,12 asteroid impacts, nuclearwinter, and others.13 A \ufb01rst comprehensive overviewof the Tambora effects was published in 1992. Thebook by Harington7 compiled the \ufb01ndings withrespect to imprints in proxies, climate data, and soci-etal impacts across various disciplines, constitutingan authoritative reference on Tambora impacts.However, much has been learned since the publica-tion of Harington (1992) using new palaeoclimatolo-gical evidence from different archives, newly digitizedinstrumental data and documentary evidence, andparticularly using coupled climate models. The bicen-tenary of the Tambora eruption provides an opportu-nity to revisit the event and revisit our understandingof its effects on climate.As an \u2018experiment of nature,14 the Tamboraeruption allows current scientists to test hypotheseson the interaction between the solid Earth and theatmosphere, atmospheric chemistry and physics,dynamics and radiation, stratosphere and tropo-sphere, atmosphere and oceans, climate and bio-sphere, climate and society, and many others.Because of its magnitude and its severe impacts,Tambora may provide additional insights to thoseobtained from studying more recent, better observederuptions. These new insights contribute to betterprocess understanding, help to project the possibleconsequences of future eruptions, and may be50 kmSumbawaSanggarPeninsulaMoyoLombokTamboraSamalas caldera(Rinjani)FIGURE 1 | Map of the Lombok\u2013Sumbawa sector of the Sunda arc, Indonesia, showing the location of Tambora and Rinjani, the sites of theprobably two largest eruptions of the last millennium.

In par-ticular, Tambora is a good test case for studying his-torical climate-society interactions. Tambora eruptedat the beginning of the early instrumental period sothat making best use of observations, proxy informa-tion, reconstructions, model simulations, and histori-cal evidence is essential and thus calls for amultidisciplinary approach. This paper focuses onthe physical processes.The paper \ufb01rst provides an overview of theeruption, stratospheric aerosols, and radiative forcing(second section). This section is based on volcanolog-ical evidence on the eruption and eyewitnessaccounts, but also evidence from environmentalarchives such as sulfate from polar ice cores. Theanalysis includes comparisons with well-observederuptions including Pinatubo (1991), as well as com-puter model results. The third section focuses onearly instrumental data and derived summer tempera-ture, precipitation, and sea-level pressure reconstruc-tions for the North Atlantic and Europe for whichthe most abundant information is available. The Fol-lowing section then analyzes the climatic imprint ofthe Tambora eruption in various natural archivessuch as tree rings, ice cores, or sediments. The \ufb01fthsection summarizes climate model studies of theTambora eruption and large volcanic eruptions ingeneral, as models are an important tool to addressthe underlying mechanisms. Finally, we present con-clusions and summarize from a present day perspec-tive what we can learn from the Tambora event.THE TAMBORA ERUPTION,AEROSOLS, AND RADIATIVE FORCINGTambora is a massive, shield-like volcano that occu-pies much of the Sanggar Peninsula in northern Sum-bawa, part of the Lesser Sunda Islands in Indonesia(Figure 1). The volcano reaches a height of 2850 m,but before 1815, it may have been one of Indonesia\u2019shighest mountains, more than 4000 m in elevation.15The climactic phase of the eruption on April10\u201311, 1815,1,16 which followed almost a week ofminor and intermittent explosions, caused the sum-mit to collapse, forming a caldera 6 \u00d7 7 km wideand more than 1 km deep (Figure 2).The 1815 Tambora eruption is probably thelargest caldera-forming eruption of the last few cen-turies. Recent estimates suggest an erupted magma(dense rock equivalent; DRE) volume of~30\u201350 km3.1,17 It is thought that this magma was arelatively homogeneous trachyandesite that wasstored in a shallow crustal reservoir before the erup-tion. During the eruption, pyroclastic \ufb02ows sweptdown all \ufb02anks of the volcano and into the seaextending the coastline of the Sanggar Peninsula. Thepyroclastic \ufb02ows and related phenomena weremainly responsible for the casualties on SumbawaIsland. Pumice and coarse ash fell close to the vol-cano on the Sanggar Peninsula, but according to eye-witness accounts the \ufb01nest volcanic ash fell as far aswestern Java, at least 1300 km from the source, andmuch was deposited into the sea. Remobilization ofthe volcanic deposits on land, and the fact that a sig-ni\ufb01cant portion of the 1815 ejecta \ufb02owed or fell intothe sea, make an accurate determination of the erup-tion volume dif\ufb01cult. For some, if not most of theolder large Holocene eruptions, some of which werelikely to be signi\ufb01cantly larger than Tambora, theerupted volumes reported may be even less accurate.On the basis of the above uncertainties, themeasured sulfur content of both the pre-eruption vol-atile content (from measurements on inclusions incrystals in the 1815 tephra deposit) and degassedmagma (from measurements on volcanic glass in thedeposit) gives an emitted SO2 mass of about 60 Mt(Tg) at the low end of the range of volumes,18 or lar-ger if the true volume is shown to be bigger.The stratigraphy of tephra deposits exploredabout 25 km from the Tambora summit sheds someFIGURE 2 | The 7 \u00d7 6 km wide and more than 1-km deep summit caldera of Tambora created by the 1815 eruption.

WIREs Climate Change published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.light on the sequence of eruption phases.16 Prior tothe cataclysmic eruption on April 10, 1815, a seriesof less intense phreatomagmatic and Plinian erup-tions took place with maximum intensity of the erup-tion exceeding 108 kg s\u22121, leading to maximumplume heights of more than 30 km. The eruption cul-minated in the climactic eruption of April 10\u201311 withan intensity of probably 3 \u00d7 108 kg s\u22121 and a maxi-mum plume height of more than 40 km.16 However,this arguably re\ufb02ects overshoot heights rather thanthe altitude at which the bulk of the gases wasinjected.19 The huge Plinian eruption column col-lapsed and formed giant pyroclastic \ufb02ows fromwhich the main co-ignimbrite or Phoenix plumearose. This sequence of events is essential for theatmospheric injection height of SO2 and \ufb01ne ash.Observations after more recent big eruptions andmodel simulations20 show that the vertical pro\ufb01les ofSO2 and \ufb01ne ash injection have maxima near theneutral buoyancy height (NBH), which is signi\ufb01-cantly lower than the maximum plume height. Dur-ing Plinian phases, when the convection of the plumeis well organized, initial momentum and heat propel\ufb01ne ash and gases to heights above the NBH, butmost of the material will fall back to the NBH, forc-ing a spread of the plumed umbrella that can exceed100 m s\u22121, leading to very fast horizontal transportof ash at NBH and distant ash fall afterwards. If themass load within the plume becomes too high, theplume starts collapsing and feeds pyroclastic \ufb02owsrapidly surging down the \ufb02anks of the volcano fortens of kilometers and \ufb01lling the near-surface atmos-phere with a mixture of hot gases and ash.From this \u2018hot pillow,\u2019 very \ufb01ne ash particlesand gases will be elutriated and form another, sec-ondary eruption column, the Phoenix or co-ignimbrite cloud. Owing to the spatial extent of thisPhoenix cloud, convection is less organized and theNBH is lower than for the original Plinian plume.Merger of both will lead to hybrid plumes. Theplume dynamics depend on a wide range of in-plumeprocesses such as condensation and freezing of waterwith formation of hydrometeors and latent heatrelease, aggregation of ash particles, rainout, wash-out and freeze-out of gases and particles, electriccharging, of which, for historic eruptions, we aremostly lacking observed information. Such eventswere simulated for eruptions close to the Tamboraeruption rates.21 For mass eruption rates of1.3 \u00d7 108 kg s\u22121 van Eaton et al.21 found NBHbased on maximum ash concentration of about13 km for dry co-ignimbrite plumes and around22 km for Plinian columns with initial water contentof 10%. For mass eruption rates of 1.1 \u00d7 109 kg s\u22121,they found NBH based on maximum ash concentra-tion of about 18 km for dry co-ignimbrite plumesand around 23 km for Plinian columns. Maximumeruption heights for these cases were simulated toabout 32\u201342 km, that is, much higher than the NBH.Gas injection heights are generally slightly higherthan ash injection heights. For the Tambora masseruption rates, we can therefore assume a verticalpro\ufb01le with a maximum injection of SO2 between20 and 25 km. This corresponds well with observedinjection height pro\ufb01les after the smaller 1991 Pina-tubo eruption.The sulfate aerosol cloud that developed fromthe injected SO2 was spread globally by the strato-spheric winds. The stratospheric meridional circula-tion transported the aerosols poleward. Ultimately,the sulfate reached the troposphere, where it wasquickly washed out. Today, Tambora\u2019s sulfate signalis still preserved in polar ice cores. In fact, estimatesof sulfate mass \ufb02uxes from bipolar ice cores providethe basis for reconstructing stratospheric sulfuramounts and of radiative forcing. However, thisrequires an assumption on the ef\ufb01ciencies of strato-spheric transport in each hemisphere. While Gaoet al.22 found an approximately equal distribution ofsulfate deposition in Antarctic and Greenland icecores, Sigl et al.23 suggested considerably higher sul-fate \ufb02uxes in Antarctica as compared to Greenland.This appears inconsistent with the fact that climateeffects were arguably much stronger in the NorthernHemisphere than the Southern Hemisphere (Proxiesand Proxy-Based Reconstructions section). In a two-dimensional aerosol model study using a sulfateinjection rate determined from ice cores, Arfeuilleet al.19 found a strongly asymmetric distribution ofhemispheric aerosol loading after the Tambora erup-tion. Owing to the timing of the Tambora eruption,at the start of the Southern Hemisphere winter sea-son, they found that the majority of the aerosol loadwas transported southward, albeit stratospheric cir-culation in 1815 is of course unknown and was pre-scribed in the model based on more recent data. Thehemispheric partitioning of aerosols thus remains anopen question. Greenland and Antarctic depositionef\ufb01ciencies (the ratio of sulfate \ufb02ux to each ice sheetto the maximum hemispheric stratospheric sulfateaerosol burden) vary as a function of the magnitudeand season of stratospheric sulfur injection.24Based on ice core-based estimates, the TamboraSO2 injection was about 3.5 times larger than the1991 Pinatubo eruption, but the resulting radiativeforcing was only about two times higher, assumingthat the larger SO2 injection produced larger aerosolparticles, with resulting smaller lifetimes and lessAdvanced Review wires.wiley.com/climatechange\u00a9 2016 The Authors.

The climate response to this thick aerosolcloud is discussed in the following sections.CLIMATE RESPONSEIN OBSERVATIONSWidespread meteorological observations across muchof Western and Central Europe began in the1780s.28 Longer series have been developed at themonthly timescale for a number of locations extend-ing back to the 17th century.29\u201332 More recent workhas seen this development extended to the dailytimescale33\u201337 ranging from Iberia in the west toEuropean Russia in the east. By the 18th century,efforts to develop distinct meteorological networkshad emerged due to the urgings and coordination ofthe Royal Society in England (by the Society\u2019s Secre-tary James Jurin), from the medical fraternity inFrance (by the Societe Royale de Medecine1776\u20131789), in Bavaria (by the Bavarian Academyof Science 1781\u20131789, in the Bayerische Ephemeri-den) and across Europe (under the Societas Meteoro-logica Palatina in Mannheim, 1781\u20131792), evenenabling weather maps to be drawn for this dec-ade.38 The Mannheim Ephemerides, reporting subda-ily meteorological observations from a network of upto 50 stations, ended in 1792 due to the NapoleonicWars, and the availability of material for the 1800sand 1810s is somewhat less extensive than the twoearlier decades and since the 1820s. Briffa andJones39 presented temperature anomaly maps for thefour seasons during 1816 and for the 1810s(1810\u20131819) with respect to 1951\u20131970 for tempera-ture and 1921\u20131960 for precipitation.

The summer of1816 was one of the coldest summers measured overmuch of Western Europe from Central Scandinavia tothe Mediterranean. Further east the few series inRussia and the Ukraine indicate a milder summer in1816. This might be due to more southerly atmos-pheric \ufb02ow from Northern Africa through Turkey towestern Russia (Figure 3, top). Anomalous low pres-sure over large parts of the North Atlantic andEurope (Figure 3, top) was connected with excessiverainfall across most of Western Europe, north of theMediterranean. Particularly in southeast England andnortheastern France (Figure 3, bottom), this summerwas most anomalously wet. European instrumentalaverages indicate that the 1810s were the coldest dec-ade since comparable records began in the 1780s.Most years within the 1810s would be classed as cold(relative to 1961\u20131990), but 2 years, 1814 and 1816stand out as being exceptionally cold. Part of this wasprobably due to the unknown eruption in 1808/180941 that is clearly evident in ice core series.23The year without a summer of 1816 has alsobeen extensively studied in these single site records(see papers in Harington7). More recent work hasused series where the subdaily data have now beendigitized.42,43 The analysis of twice-daily data fromGeneva,42 which is located in the region with the lar-gest negative temperature anomaly in 1816 in Europe(see P\ufb01ster,44 Trigo et al.,45 and Figure 3), shows thatthe afternoon temperature anomalies (compared tothe contemporary reference period 1799\u20131821, with-out the volcanically perturbed years 1809\u20131811 and1815\u20131817) were more strongly affected than themorning temperatures. The entire distribution of tem-perature anomalies was shifted by \u22123.8\u0001C comparedto the reference period. For the sunrise temperature,a smaller shift (-1.8\u0001C) was found, with a distinctnarrowing of the distribution. Extremely low sunrisetemperatures were as rare in 1816 as in the referenceperiod, but warmer than average sunrise tempera-tures were missing.42 Both the larger change in after-noon temperatures and the change in the distributioncan be explained by an increase in cloud cover,which is well documented and can in turn be relatedto a signi\ufb01cant change in weather types. For Geneva,a tripling of \u2018low pressure\u2019 situations and an absenceof \u2018high pressure\u2019 situations was observed as illus-trated by the pressure reconstruction in Figure 3. Pre-cipitation in Geneva in summer 1816 increased by80% but with no change in the intensity distribution,that is, the frequency of precipitation daysincreased.42 Analysis of this single site suggests thatthe summer 1816 was characterized by extreme cli-mate (weather types statistics) and not extremeweather (the tails of the distributions were not muchaffected). Subdaily pressure data from around 50 sitesin Europe and North America show an increased syn-optic activity (measured by a 2\u20136 days bandpass \ufb01lterand expressed relative to a present day climatology)in a band stretching from western France to Austria.This suggests increased storminess due to frequentpassages of storms, consistent with the space-timepattern of precipitation.43 These anomalies in weatherpatterns found in the observations are qualitativelyconsistent with model studies (see Section MODEL-ING THE CLIMATE EFFECT OF THE TAMBORAERUPTION), although presumably a large fraction ofunforced variability contributed.Other long daily series across Europe have alsobeen analyzed. The most well-known temperatureseries is the Central England Temperature (CET)series, which extends back on a monthly timescale to1659 and to 1772 at the daily timescale.46 Focusingjust on the JJA summer, 1816 stands out as the cold-est summer of the 1810s and in the long CET series asthe third coldest summer since 1659 (colder summerswere measured in 1725 and 1695). Figure 4 showsthe daily temperatures during 1816 compared tothose in the most recent complete year (2014) whichwas the warmest year in the CET series. For 1816only a few days were above the 1961\u201390 period, withonly 1 week in the spring and summer (in late April)being above. 2014, in contrast, experienced only afew days below average. Averaged annually, the2 years differ by only 3.0\u0001C, with 1816 having anaverage of 7.9\u0001C and 2014 an average of 10.9\u0001C.Whilst much of Europe was exceedingly coldand wet during the summer of 1816 (in agreementwith the consistent lower than average pressures,Figure 3 top), the entire North Atlantic Europeanregion (shown in Figure 3, land-only) was much closerto average (see also Figure 3). Temperatures wereaverage in the far north of Sweden47,48 and abovenormal at St Petersburg.49 Further a\ufb01eld, the summerwas known to be very cold in New England (3.0\u0001Cbelow the 1961\u20131990 average at Boston,7 where it isreferred to as the \u2018Year Without a Summer\u2019). Recentmodel-constrained reconstructions indicate that overa large part of eastern North America, temperatureswere 2\u0001 C below the 1700\u20131890 average.50Estimates of the temperature impacts of Tam-bora over a wider spatial scale are available frommarine observations.51 The English East India Com-pany maintained a \ufb02eet of ships trading betweenAdvanced Review wires.wiley.com/climatechange\u00a9 2016 The Authors. WIREs Climate Change published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Britain and southeastern Asia over a long period, andbetween about 1794 and 1833 many of these shipsrecorded noon temperatures in their logs. These obser-vations allow annual temperature variability to bereconstructed over a large area of the Atlantic andIndian Oceans.52 The year 1816 was the coldest yearover this region, for this period, with an anomaly ofabout \u22120.6\u0001C compared to the 1794\u20131833 period aver-age (the second coldest year was 1809, also volcani-cally in\ufb02uenced by the unknown 1808/1809 eruption).Ships\u2019 logs also provide climate informationfrom other regions. The Hudson\u2019s Bay Companyships traveled between Britain and trading posts inHudson\u2019s Bay in present-day Canada. These ships didnot record instrumental weather observations, buttheir logs do provide rich information on the sea-iceconditions in Hudson Strait over the period1751\u20131870. Sea-ice conditions were more severe in1816 than in any other year in this record.53 How-ever, these extreme ice conditions are arguably morelikely to be a result of anomalous local circulationthan of large-scale temperature changes54\u2014this isillustrated by the contrasting observations of WilliamScoresby Jr55: Scoresby recorded temperatures onwhaling voyages in the Greenland Sea every summerfrom 1810 to 1818 and these observations indicatethat 1816 was a relatively warm year, with less thanthe usual sea-ice coverage.56 Scoresby emphasized thisin a letter to Sir Joseph Banks, president of the RoyalSociety, stating: \u2018I observed on my last voyage (1817)about 2000 square leagues [18 000 square miles] ofthe surface of the Greenland seas, included betweenthe parallels of 74\u0001 and 80\u0001, perfectly void of ice, allof which disappeared within the last two years.\u201957The instrumental observations clearly show theexpected moderate large-scale cooling effect of theeruption, but also demonstrate that local effects canbe quite different from the large-scale mean, andsometimes much more extreme. However, for muchof the world in 1816, no instrumental observationrecords are currently available, so we must turn toproxy data to see what happened in those regions.CLIMATE IMPRINT IN PROXIES ANDPROXY-BASED RECONSTRUCTIONSApart from instrumental information, naturalsources can provide further information on the sum-mer temperature and precipitation conditions in1816. From statistically reconstructed global orNorthern Hemispheric annual mean temperaturereconstructions,2\u20134,58,59 it becomes obvious that1816 was among the coldest years of the past centu-ries. However, the various published reconstructionsdisagree about the amplitude of the anomaly.60 Com-pared to the 1961\u20131990 period, estimates range from\u22120.66 \u0003 0.24\u0001C (standard deviation) for NorthernHemisphere temperature,59 to \u22121.14\u0001C for the tem-perature between 30\u0001 and 90\u0001N2 and \u22121.9\u0001C for theNorthern Hemisphere61 (differences relative to1785\u20131815 are much smaller, in the range of \u22120.4 to\u22120.8\u0001C). It is important that in most reconstructions,the summer of 1816 followed a period with a nega-tive temperature trend. The early 1810s were possi-bly already being in\ufb02uenced by the volcano in 1808/1809 and the lower solar insolation during the Dal-ton Minimum (1790\u20131830).AprilJanuary\u201315\u201310 Daily Central England Temperature (Parker & Horton 2005)1961\u20131990 smoothed normals1961\u20131990 smoothed 5th & 95th percentilesDaily Central England Temperature (Parker & Horton 2005)1961\u20131990 smoothed normals1961\u20131990 smoothed 5th & 95th percentiles\u201350510Temperature (\u00b0C)152025\u20135\u201310051015Temperature (\u00b0C)20253018162014JulyOctoberJanuaryAprilJanuaryJulyOctoberJanuaryFIGURE 4 | Daily Central England temperatures for each day ofthe year for 1816 and 2014.

WIREs Climate Change published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Most natural proxies (e.g., trees, lake/marinevarves) and historical records62,63 tell us about condi-tions in the summer, and it is this season that had thelargest impact in 1816 across Europe and easternNorth America. Information from tree rings providesindications about mean summer climate across theboreal forest zones of North America and Eurasia.Tree ring density is currently the most accurate proxyfor the interannual temperature response to volcaniceruptions.64 Using tree ring density data, Briffaet al.65 showed positive temperature anomalies overparts of western America, but cold and very coldconditions around the rest of the mid latitudes of theNorthern Hemisphere. This is in agreement withother tree ring-based summer temperature recon-structions that indicate strong summer cooling in1816 in large parts of the Arctic, Northern Europe,eastern North America, and Asia.66\u201368 This changein the pattern of anomalies suggests a differentRossby-wave pattern during this summer than expe-rienced in most summers during the last 200 years.For the winter 1816/1817, climate \ufb01eld recon-structions suggest a winter warming32 similar to thetemperature pattern found in composite analysis ofstrong volcanic eruptions during the last 500 years.69The reason for this warming is the North AtlanticOscillation (NAO) which develops a positive phaseafter a volcanic eruption, that is, enhanced westerliesover the Atlantic European region. This dynamicalresponse is con\ufb01rmed by a recent NAO reconstruc-tion showing a positive phase of the NAO in the win-ter 1816/1817.69While the proxies from the Northern Hemi-sphere land areas generally show substantial coolingin 1816, Tambora\u2019s temperature imprint in theSouthern Hemisphere appears to be substantiallyweaker. Hemispheric temperatures70 do not show asigni\ufb01cant cooling in the years following the erup-tion, neither do regional reconstructions from SouthAmerica, Australasia, and Antarctica.71 This weakresponse is generally consistent for large volcaniceruptions over the past centuries. As the SouthernHemisphere is mostly covered by oceans and its landmasses are distributed more toward lower latitudesthan their northern counterparts, a weaker and lessimmediate climatic response to volcanic eruptions isexpected. Modes of internal variability, particularlyof El Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and theSouthern Annular Mode (SAM) have a very strongin\ufb02uence on the Southern Hemisphere continents.Reconstructions of the SAM72 do not indicate a sig-ni\ufb01cant response to volcanic eruptions. A shift ofENSO toward an El-Ni\u00f1o state is found in somestudies.73 However, it does not stand out of internalvariability, which is generally larger than externallyforced in\ufb02uences.74 This nonresponse in key circula-tion modes may explain the weak imprint of volcaniceruptions on continental temperatures in the South-ern Hemisphere. These \ufb01ndings from the SouthernHemisphere are not in agreement with many climatemodels, which usually \ufb01nd volcanic cooling of simi-lar amplitude in both hemispheres.70 Thus, currentclimate models tend to overemphasize interhemi-spheric synchronicity by underestimating the in\ufb02u-ence of internal variability particularly in theSouthern Hemisphere.70 However, the temporal andspatial proxy data coverage is still much weaker inthe Southern Hemisphere compared to Europe andNorth America. Hence, the apparent absence of vol-canic cooling in the Southern Hemisphere may be anartifact of the low number of records able to resolveshort-term peaks of climatic anomalies. Alternatively(though not supported by ice cores), the amount ofaerosols reaching the Southern Hemisphere mighthave been smaller than assumed in these models.Recent coral-based reconstructions of tropicalSSTs in the Indian, West and East Paci\ufb01c Oceansshow the coldest temperatures over the past400 years in the early 19th century.74 While only theIndian Ocean displays a distinct interannual coldanomaly after the Tambora eruption, the decadal-scale cooling starts around 1800 in all three basins,indicating that Tambora ampli\ufb01es, rather than trig-gers the cold period. However, the level of this ampli-\ufb01cation via volcanic eruptions cannot be quanti\ufb01edwith reconstructions alone.Drought reconstructions have been producedbased on tree ring information from North Americaand for South Asia.75,76 The Monsoon Asia DroughtAtlas for May\u2013September 1816 shows dry conditionsin India and South Eastern Asia (weakening of themonsoon) and anomalous wet conditions in northernparts of Asia.76 This is partly consistent with multi-proxy (tree rings, historical documentary records,and ice cores) May\u2013September precipitation recon-structions by Feng et al.77 The North AmericaDrought Atlas for 1816 indicates wet conditions inthe US Southwest (though mainly a winter response)and summer drought in the East.75MODELING THE CLIMATE EFFECTOF THE TAMBORA ERUPTIONClimate models are an important tool to study themechanisms of Tambora\u2019s impact on climate.78\u201382 Infact, model results for the Tambora eruption agreewith sparse observations and proxy data in someaspects.78\u201381 For a more comprehensiveAdvanced Review wires.wiley.com/climatechange\u00a9 2016 The Authors. WIREs Climate Change published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.understanding of the mechanisms, results need to bereconciled with those found for other strong tropicalvolcanic eruptions. In agreement with observationsand reconstructions, climate modeling studies show adrop in near-surface temperature of about 1\u0001C overthe global land areas after the Tambora eruption(Tables 1 and 2). The temperature minimum lagsbehind the aerosol optical depth maximum by about2 years and gradually returns to climatological meanvalues after 6\u201310 years (Figure 5 for Northern Hemi-sphere temperatures). The ocean cools less than theland due to its greater heat capacity. As a result ofreduced near-surface temperatures, simulated North-ern hemispheric sea ice is increased and peaks3\u20137 years after the eruption.27,80,81,83The temperature reduction goes along with aslowdown of the global water cycle.84,85 Globalprecipitation is simulated to decrease by about0.12 mm/day after the eruption. Again, the water cycleresponse over land is stronger than over the ocean dueto the less strong ocean cooling. Model studies ofTambora\u2019s climate effects suggest that the water cycleresponse mainly affected the tropical rainforest andocean regions,17 which is in line with model studies ofother large eruptions.26,82,86 Tambora modeling stud-ies further imply that the change in the land-sea ther-mal contrast weakens the monsoonal circulations andleads to drying in monsoon regions.87 Volcanic erup-tions may also change the temperature gradientbetween the hemispheres. As a consequence, modelsimulations indicate a southward movement of theIntertropical Convergence Zone due to the increasedcooling of the Northern Hemisphere landmasses ascompared to the Southern Hemisphere oceans.84,85TABLE 1 | Overview of Tambora modelling studies indicating the forcings used and peak temperature changes over global land areas.Estimates Indicated by \u2723 Are Not Explicitly Given in the Cited Studies, But Have Been Calculated for This PublicationStudy Aerosol/Forcing ModelEnsembleSize Peak DT [K] DurationTambora-only sensitivity studies:Stenchikov et al.

WIREs Climate Change published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Simulated regional scale temperature and precip-itation responses to large tropical eruptions atmid latitudes are heterogeneous. In summer, Westernand Central Europe become cool, but not EasternEurope.82 Furthermore, an increase of summer precip-itation is simulated over Southcentral Europe.82,83,85Both responses, which are also found in Tamborasimulations, are consistent with observations andreconstructions.88 The increase in precipitationmight be due to a weakening and expansion of theHadley Cell after the eruption.82,89Winter precipitation is reduced in Central andWestern Europe as well as over the US East Coastand large parts of the Northern Paci\ufb01c after largeeruptions, but increased over Northern Europe, con-sistent with a positive NAO.90 This is consistent withobservations.The winter warming in Northeastern Europeand positive NAO response following strong tropicaleruptions, which is well known from observationsand reconstructions,88 is no longer well reproducedby climate models.91\u201393 An overall reduction of win-ter 500-hPa geopotential height is found in theensemble mean of simulations, but individual modelmembers are able to resemble the positive NAOstructure of the reconstructions with increased geo-potential height over Southern Europe and stronglynegative anomalies over Iceland.87,89,94 Additionally,an intensi\ufb01cation of the polar vortex after the Tam-bora eruption is simulated,90 which is hypothesizedas the underlying process of the positive NAO andwinter warming signal.79,95,96The starting point of this mechanism is thestratosphere, where sulfate aerosols locally heat theair by absorbing terrestrial infrared as well as solarand terrestrial near-infrared radiation and reduce thetransfer of short-wave radiation into lower levels.When the aerosols enter the stratosphere at tropicallatitudes as for Tambora they are lifted and globallydistributed by the Brewer\u2013Dobson circulation. Ini-tially most aerosols reside in the tropical stratosphere.This unequal distribution of aerosols leads to unequaldistribution in absorbed radiation, which perturbs themeridional and vertical temperature gradients in thestratosphere. In winter, where the temperature distri-bution has a strong in\ufb02uence on the dynamics, thepolar vortex is strengthened and the vertical propaga-tion of planetary waves is altered.95\u201399 The down-ward propagation of these pronounced dynamicalchanges is held responsible for the winter warmingsignal over Northern to Central Europe.89,90,95\u201399In comparison to the 2.5\u0001C warming observedin the tropical stratosphere after Mount Pinatubo,100a stronger warming after Tambora is likely, althoughthe warming cannot be expected to scale linearlywith the aerosol mass, because the response alsodepends on the microphysical properties of the aero-sols.101 Modeling studies suggest temperatureanomalies about two to four times that ofPinatubo,90,102\u2013104 but the response depends also onthe climate model and aerosol forcing applied.

After recent eruptions, pronouncedreductions of ozone were observed,106 which aresuggested to amplify the dynamic response of thestratosphere.107,108 For Tambora, however, theresponse of the ozone chemistry is assumed to be dif-ferent. With low concentrations of ozone-depletingsubstances a slight increase of ozone concentrationsis expected109 (Figure 6) with no pronounced in\ufb02u-ences on stratospheric dynamics.103,108 Nevertheless,the choice of the ozone dataset in climate modelsimulations has been shown to have substantial effecton the dynamic response to the Tambora eruption.90Large volcanic eruptions like Tambora canimpact the ocean. Their signals in ocean heat contentmay persist for decades, well beyond the lifetime ofstratospheric aerosols.74,80,110 The Tambora eruptionarguably coincided with an El Ni\u00f1o event,111 whichwas also the case for the majority of other strongtropical volcanic eruptions during the last 500 years.This has raised the question of whether volcanic erup-tions can excite El Ni\u00f1o events.112\u2013114 Simulationswith a climate model of intermediate complexity showthat only volcanic eruptions larger than the Pinatubosize can enhance the likelihood and amplitude of an ElNi\u00f1o event.73 McGregor and Timmermann115 sug-gested that while the dynamical thermostat mechanism(i.e., the regulation of tropical Paci\ufb01c sea surface tem-peratures (SSTs) through a change in the zonal tem-perature gradient and wind stress116) favors El Ni\u00f1oevents in simpli\ufb01ed, spatially uniform set-ups, thespatial gradients in mixed-layer depth, cloud albedoand other variables modify the response and counter-act the El Ni\u00f1o-like response. CMIP5 historical simu-lations provide an opportunity to study this effect in amultimodel ensemble. While Ding et al.117 found onlya weak effect, Maher et al. found an El Ni\u00f1o responsein the year following volcanic eruptions, and then aLa Nin\u00e3 2 years later.118Stenchikov et al.80 and Ottera et al.119 showedthat major eruptions strengthen the Atlantic Meridio-nal Overturning Circulation by a Sverdrup or moreon multidecadal timescales, and consequentlyincrease the northward heat transport. Possiblemechanisms for the increase include changes inwinter-time wind stress and density increases of polarsurface waters. However, the models vary greatly intheir simulated response.113,120\u2013122 Furthermore,cooling events, possibly also strong volcanic erup-tions like Tambora, may trigger a coupled sea ice-ocean\u2013atmosphere feedback in the North Atlanticand the Nordic Seas.123The background state of the climate systemmay play an important role in the post volcanicresponse characteristics of the coupled sea ice-ocean\u2013atmosphere.

WIREs Climate Change published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.changes initiated by the volcanically inducedstrengthening of the Southern Hemisphere\u2019s strato-spheric polar vortex (positive SAM) and to localfeedback processes. After an initial post volcanicshort-lived expansion Antarctic sea ice undergoes aprolonged contraction phase. Very large volcanicforcing may therefore be a source of interhemisphericinterannual-to-decadal climate variability, althoughthe interhemispheric signature is weak in the case ofhistorical-size eruptions like Tambora.Large volcanic eruptions, such as Tambora,may also impact the carbon cycle.96,127 The responseof the terrestrial biosphere and ocean biogeochemis-try to volcanic eruptions sensitively depends onchanges in solar radiation (direct and diffuse), tem-perature, precipitation, \ufb01res, and atmospheric andoceanic circulation. Although the exact mechanismscausing a decrease in atmospheric CO2 after volcaniceruptions are poorly known, it is likely that the Tam-bora eruption caused a decrease in atmospheric CO2concentration of a few ppm on decadal time-scales.83,110 It is also very likely that the volcanicemissions of CO2 during the Tambora eruption havenot signi\ufb01cantly impacted atmospheric CO2.128In modeling and atmospheric inversion studies,focusing mainly on the Pinatubo eruption, the terres-trial biosphere has been identi\ufb01ed as the main driverof atmospheric CO2 changes, with minor temporarycontributions of the ocean.83,110,129\u2013133 However, theexact mechanisms (net primary production vs respi-ration) by which the terrestrial biosphere drives adecadal-scale decrease in atmospheric CO2 as well asthe geographical distribution of changes are poorlyknown (low latitudes vs high northern latitudes).Modeling studies suggest that the sulfate aerosol-induced cooling reduces heterotrophic respiration intropical and subtropical soils.110,126,129\u2013131 Thisincreased soil carbon storage dominates over reducedlitter input due to precipitation and soil moisturedecrease and ultimately leads to increased terrestrialcarbon uptake and decreases in atmospheric CO2.Other studies suggest more carbon uptake in north-ern high latitudes,133,134 or no change,110 whereassome studies predict a carbon source due todecreased net primary production.83,130,131The ocean initially acts as a weak carbon sinkafter a volcanic eruption, which is primarily due totemperature-induced increase in CO2 solubility inlow-latitude shallow waters. After the cooling signalfades, the ocean is suggested to quickly transformitself from a weak carbon sink to a weak carbonsource.110,132In addition to the suggested temperature andprecipitation driven changes on land, several studiesalso suggest that an increase in diffuse radiation aftervolcanic eruptions may enhance the terrestrial carbonsink via enhanced net primary production.135\u2013137Others argue that this effect was probably only ableto compensate for the reduction in total radiation.138Recent laboratory experiments and direct evidence inthe North Paci\ufb01c also indicate that the deposition ofvolcanic ash on the oceanic surface may increase netprimary production in the ocean,139\u2013141 but theimpact on atmospheric CO2 remains unclear.142Most current coupled climate models do not includethese effects.Although reconstructions from Antarctic icecores do not reveal signi\ufb01cant changes in CO2 afterthe Tambora eruption, which may be due to lowsampling resolution and diffusion within the archive,modeling studies suggest that atmospheric CO2decreased by about 6 ppm after the Tambora erup-tion.83,110 The maximum decrease is delayed by acouple of years compared to changes in sulfate aero-sols and atmospheric temperature. The recovery ofthe atmospheric CO2 concentration takes longer thanfor the bulk change in temperature as longer time-scales are involved in the biogeochemical cycles thanin the physical processes of the atmosphere and thesurface ocean. Similarly to the ocean responsedescribed above, Fr\u00f6licher et al.129 found that thecarbon cycle response to volcanic eruptions criticallydepends on the initial conditions at the time of theeruption, with a larger atmospheric CO2 decreasewhen volcanic eruptions occur during El Ni\u00f1o and inwinter than during La Ni\u00f1a conditions.CONCLUSIONSSince 1815 the world has not been faced with aneruption of a similar strength as that of Tambora.Still, the eruption has received great attention in thesciences as it provides a rich testbed to deepen ourunderstanding of processes during enormous erup-tions and related distant impacts. Certainly mankindwill be faced with such events in the future. Thebicentenary of the Tambora eruption provides a per-fect opportunity to reconcile our current understand-ing and to place the Tambora-speci\ufb01c \ufb01ndings in abroader context of processes that are relevant duringand after volcanic eruptions.During recent decades, processes during andafter Tambora have been intensively investigated,narrowing down the potential volume to~30\u201350 km3.1,17 The injection height might havebeen up to 40 km, but the NBH (which is relevantfor the emissions) was more likely about 25 km. Still,WIREs Climate Change Tambora 1815 as a test case for high impact volcanic eruptions\u00a9 2016 The Authors. WIREs Climate Change published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.the volume and particularly the interhemispheric dis-tribution of the aerosols, as well as particles sizes, arenot well constrained and uncertainties about theexact values remain.Not only does the climate forcing of the Tam-bora eruption have remaining uncertainties, but alsothe details of the climate response. Instrumental datagive a detailed picture of weather and climate in spe-ci\ufb01c regions following the eruption and allow addres-sing, for example, increased synoptic activity overWestern Europe in the summer of 1816. However,the instrumental data cover only Europe and parts ofNorth America. Nevertheless, advances in digitizingearly measurements from land and oceans and anincreasing network of highly resolved records fromdifferent proxy archives have led to a better globalcoverage of climate information in 1816 showing awidespread reduction of surface air temperatures andimplications of the hydrological cycle in sensitiveareas like the monsoon regions. One key \ufb01ndingfrom climate proxies is the absence of a strong Tam-bora signal in the extratropical Southern Hemi-sphere, while it is clearly expressed in the NorthernHemisphere and Tropics. This is particularly intri-guing as aerosol model studies suggest that transportof aerosols was stronger toward the Southern Hemi-sphere than the Northern Hemisphere and ice corestudies suggest equal partitioning or stronger trans-port toward the Southern Hemisphere.Modeling studies allow addressing possible,physically consistent mechanisms, which may havecaused the observed signal. Simulations are able toreproduce many aspects of post-Tambora climate asfound in observations and proxies. The mechanismsare mostly the same as found for other strong tropi-cal eruptions that are better constrained by observa-tions (such as the Pinatubo eruption in 1991), butthe simulated signal is stronger. However, results aresensitive to some of the uncertain parameters men-tioned above. Hence, for future eruptions, one needsto take these parameters into account to cover thefull uncertainty range. Moreover, climate modelsimulations indicate that background conditions,such as the preceding 1808/1809 eruption(unknown) and possibly the Dalton Minimum ofsolar activity were important for the climatic conse-quences of the Tambora eruption, which also needsto be taken into account when anticipating effects offuture eruptions.The effect of volcanic eruptions on the biogeo-chemical cycles has become an interesting researchtopic. In particular, the simulated carbon cycleresponse triggers a range of important new questionsfor future research.To advance our current understanding of thedominant mechanisms behind simulated posteruptionclimate evolution, but also more generally, of climatedynamics and decadal variability, an internationalmodel intercomparison project on the climaticresponse to volcanic forcing (VolMIP)143 has beenestablished for the 6th cycle of the Coupled ModelIntercomparison Project (CMIP6). In VolMIP, the1815 Tambora eruption has been chosen as coreexperiment, to address the long-term (up to the deca-dal timescale) climate response to large volcaniceruptions featuring a high signal-to-noise ratio in theresponse of global-average surface temperature.144Although an improved knowledge about the climateresponse after the Tambora eruption is expectedfrom the VOLMIP activity, it might still be a chal-lenge to explain all observed regional climateanomalies.During the past decades, our scienti\ufb01c under-standing of the Tambora eruption has grown tremen-dously, and from studying the Tambora eruption,science has gained insights into many complexmechanisms operating in the climate system. Insightshave also been gained on sensitivity of the system toboundary conditions, which is important forenabling society to be prepared for future eruptions.In this sense, science will undoubtedly keep learningfrom Tambora.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThis paper is dedicated to the memory of Tom Crowley, who made substantial contributions to the under-standing of the role of volcanic eruptions in the Earth system.

Detection and attribution of climate changeIntroductionThe balance between net incoming solar radiation and outgo-ing terrestrial radiation at the top of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere(TOA) fundamentally drives our climate system.Perturbations to this balance, either as a result of natural var-iability or anthropogenic activity, ultimately result in either aheating or cooling of the Earth system such that measurementsof the Earth\u2019s radiation budget (ERB) at the TOA are essentialin order to understand how our climate is evolving with time.Broadband, spectrally integrated measurements of the solarradiation reflected by the Earth (reflected shortwave, RSW)and outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) emitted by the Earthhave been made by a variety of satellite sensors for over fourdecades (Fig. 1a and Table 1). Despite the limited lifetimes ofindividual satellite missions, changes in measurement tech-niques and uncertainties in instrument calibration resultingin some controversy regarding the absolute level of the vari-ous components at any given time [9, 10], these observationshave had a major impact on our understanding of, and abilityto model, our climate system [11\u201314]. However, there is acaveat: broadband measurements effectively integrate all theenergy across the shortwave or longwave spectrum whichmay mask signatures associated with particular climate pro-cesses due to compensating effects [15].In contrast, spectrally resolved measurements of the outgo-ing radiation can be used to identify and monitor the effects ofmany different processes [16, 17]. This is not surprising sincesatellite observations of the reflected and emitted radiation indifferent wavelength bands across the RSW and OLR spec-trum are routinely used to retrieve many geophysical param-eters from surface temperature to cloud optical properties.However, whilst the potential for the simultaneous detectionand attribution of climate change using direct observations ofthe spectrally resolved OLR has been recognised for someThis article is part of the Topical Collection on Global Energy Budgets* H.

This re-view paper summarises these new advances, setting them inthe context of previous work and considers future develop-ments in the area. Whilst we note the contribution that thelong-term availability of stable hyperspectral measurementshas undoubtedly made and will continue to make to our abilityto derive key climate variables such as temperature, carbondioxide and water vapour [28\u201330], with recent studies dem-onstrating how well such retrievals map to the observed radi-ance trends [31], our focus in this article is on the direct use ofthe observed radiances in climate change research.Early Work: the 1980sConcern in the late 1970s regarding the potential impact ofincreases in atmospheric CO2 on the Earth\u2019s climate saw anumber of scientific papers devoted to detecting a clear,CO2 induced signal in variables including surface tem-perature [32, 33], ice cover [34] and sea level rise [35].The difficulty in attributing the response of the chosenvariable to a specific cause given the natural variabilityof, and confounding factors within, the climate systemwas a common theme in these studies. In their work,Madden and Ramanathan mooted the possibility ofusing spectrally resolved satellite observations of theERB to provide this attribution, suggesting that whilstincreasing CO2 should reduce the outgoing energy with-in its absorption bands, the expected associated surfaceheating should enhance emission within more transpar-ent regions of the spectrum. Should this surface heatingtrigger feedbacks such as changes in cloud amount, theRSW energy would also change.Developing this suggestion, Kiehl simulated changes inclear-sky spectrally resolved OLR in the strong 15-\u03bcm(667 cm\u22121) band for a doubling of atmospheric CO2 [36].His work investigated the impact of both CO2 increases aloneand when considered in concert with the associated tropo-spheric and stratospheric temperature response. In isolation,CO2 increases result in enhanced absorption across the band,shifting the emitting level seen from space to higher in theatmosphere. At band centre, this shift is to higher levels inthe stratosphere where temperature increases with height, in-creasing the emission to space. Conversely, in the band wings,the shift occurs within the troposphere where temperaturedecreases with height, reducing the outgoing radiation. Theresult is a cooling of the stratosphere and warming of thetroposphere and surface. Hence, when the temperature re-sponse to a CO2 increase is included, the CO2-only changesRSW & OLR broadband ScaRaB (MEGHA-TROPIQUES)1980 1990 2000 Time (Year)2010 ERB (Nimbus-6) ERB (Nimbus-7) ERBE (NOAA-9, 10 & ERBS) CERES (TERRA) CERES (AQUA) CERES (NPP) GERB (METEOSAT-8) GERB (METEOSAT-10) GERB (METEOSAT-9) aScaRaB(Meteor 3-6) ScaRaB (Resurs O1-4)CERES (TRMM)1980 1990 2000 Time (Year) 2010 RSW spectral observations OLR spectral observations CrIS (S-NPP) SCIAMACHY (Envisat)IASI (METOP-B) AIRS(AQUA)IASI (METOP-A) IMG (ADEOS) IRIS-D  (Nimbus-4) SI-GDR  (Meteor-28,29) bFig. 1 a Examples of some of thekey satellite observations of RSWand OLR over the past fivedecades. b As (a) for spectralRSWand OLR.

Charlock extended Kiehl\u2019s study to a wider spectralrange, including the 4.3-\u03bcm (2325 cm\u22121) CO2 band and in-corporating the atmospheric humidity response to the CO2doubling [37]. His results confirmed Kiehl\u2019s findings but alsoshowed that clear-sky emission to space within the atmospher-ic window (8\u201312\u03bcm; \u223c800\u20131250 cm\u22121) would be expected toincrease. Whilst these early results were obtained using radi-ative transfer codes and atmospheric realisations that wouldnow be considered far from state-of-the-art, the basic findingsremain true (Fig. 2).ATopic Revisited: 1990s\u2013Early 2000sDespite their promise, these theoretical studies did not imme-diately spark huge interest in the use of spectrally resolvedOLR to detect and attribute climate change. Indeed, it wasnot until the mid-1990s that interest in the topic was revived,principally due to the re-evaluation of observations from theInfraRed Interferometer Spectrometer (IRIS-D) by Goody andco-workers at CalTech. IRIS-D, on the Nimbus-4 meteorolog-ical satellite, measured the Earth\u2019s outgoing longwave spec-trum from April 1970 to January 1971 [19]. Spanning therange 400\u20131600 cm\u22121 (6.25\u201325 \u03bcm) with a nominal spectralresolution of 2.8 cm\u22121, observations from the instrument hadpreviously been used to provide insight into the spatio-temporal distribution of variables such as methane and cirruscloud [38, 39]. Motivated both by the prospect of long-termhyperspectral measurements from the proposed AtmosphericInfraRed Sounder (AIRS) and the development of mathemat-ical techniques to optimise fingerprints of climate change [40],Goody used the IRIS-D measurements to estimate the\u2018weather noise\u2019 or short-term variability of the Earth\u2019sOLR spectrum. Combining these estimates with simulat-ed \u2018climate forcing\u2019 signals due to, for example, a dou-bling of CO2 or an increase in incoming solar flux, heintroduced the concepts of spectral selectivity and sen-sitivity. The former term relates to the ability to distin-guish between forcings, the latter, the time needed for asignal to emerge from background noise [18].Whilst this study indicated that in certain regions of thespectrum a distinct change signal could be identified and at-tributed to a particular forcing with reasonable confidence, theauthors acknowledged that the work was designed more tostimulate further discussion than give definitive answers re-garding the most promising detection strategy. The CalTechgroup continued to refine their approach whilst championingthe use of well-calibrated, accurate, spectrally resolved OLRmeasurements to test climate model performance [41\u201343].Table 1 Characteristics of broadband instruments highlighted in Fig. 1aInstrument name Spectral range Spatial resolution(at nadir) (km)Temporal coverage (launch date to end ofinstrument operation)Earth Radiation Budget (ERB) [1, 2] Broadband OLR and RSWSWand IR channels500a150aJune 1975\u2013October 1978 (Nimbus-6)October 1978\u2013October 1987 (Nimbus-7)Earth Radiation Budget Experiment(ERBE) [3]BroadbandOLR and RSW40a October 1984\u2013February 1990 (Scanner)October 1984\u2013August 1999 (Non-scanner)bClouds and the Earth\u2019s Radiant EnergySystem (CERES) [4]BroadbandOLR and RSWIR window channel1020November 1997\u2013September 1998 (TRMM)cDecember 1999\u2013present (Terra)April 2002\u2013present (Aqua)October 2011\u2013present (NPP)Geostationary Earth Radiation Budget(GERB) [5]BroadbandOLR and RSW50 August 2002\u2013April 2007 (Meteosat-8)December 2005\u2013January 2013 (Meteosat-9)July 2012\u2013present (Meteosat-10)dScanner for Radiation Budget(ScaRaB) [6\u20138]BroadbandOLR and RSWVisible and IR windowchannels604140January 1994\u2013March 1995 (Meteor)July 1998\u2013March 1999 (Resurs 01\u20134)October 2011\u2013present (Megha-Tropiques)eApart from the exceptions noted below, all instruments have global coveragea The quoted spatial resolution corresponds to the analysed ERB data from the scanning, narrow field of view channels on the relevant satellites, coarserresolution is provided by the wide field of view non-scanner measurementsb The non-scanner instrument on the ERBS satellite viewed the region 60\u201360\u00b0 N/Sc CERES on TRMM viewed the region 40\u201340\u00b0 N/Sd GERB fluxes are produced for the region 60\u201360\u00b0 N/S and E/W.

Their vision was toestablish a system that gave global coverage, measuringquantities that had the information content required toenable scientists to reduce the uncertainty which existed(and still exists) in projections of future climate, with ademonstrable absolute accuracy and precision thatwould mean that the measurements could be trusted inperpetuity [46, 47]. Their proposed solution involvedthe space-based measurement of spectrally resolved ther-mal infrared radiation and atmospheric refractivity, thelatter employing satellites within the Global PositioningSystem (GPS) network.Inspired by this work, UK researchers were alsoquestioning how observations of the OLR spectrum could beapplied to the problem of climatic change. Slingo and Webbused output from the Hadley Centre climate model to simulatethe expected clear-sky changes in spectral OLR between 1860and 2040 in order to examine the signature of climatic re-sponse to greenhouse gas forcing [48]. One of their key find-ings was the very small changes seen in regions sensitive tomid and upper tropospheric water vapour. These arose be-cause of the propensity of the model to conserve troposphericrelative humidity with time, a signature of positive water va-pour feedback. In conjunction, a series of papers by Harriesand co-workers investigated the potential of developingspatio-spectral detection fingerprints based on the availabilityof multi-decadal records from narrow-band radiometers,utilising the simulation results to test their approach [49\u201351].The papers highlighted the difficulty of constructing consis-tent, long-term time series from the operational records andthe need to better characterise natural variability in order toassess the significance of any model-observation discrepancy.Whilst model simulations provided an indication of theexpected change in spectrally resolved OLR, the absence ofa suitable multi-year observational record with which to con-front these simulations was a barrier to progress. This situationwould change in the early 2000s, but prior to this, the fewmissions designed to measure the OLR spectrum tended, likeIRIS-D, to operate for short periods of time (Fig. 1b).Nonetheless, recognising that over a multi-decadal time gapcertain forcing signatures should be imprinted in the OLRspectrum, Harries et al. conducted a comparison of clear-skyobservations from IRIS-D with those taken almost 30 yearslater from the Interferometric Monitor for Greenhouse Gases(IMG) [52]. Their findings, re-plotted here in Fig. 3, providedthe first observational evidence of the impact of increases inwell-mixed greenhouse gases on the OLR spectrum.Subsequent analyses of the temporal and spatial samplingcharacteristics of the IRIS-D and IMG datasets [53] and ofthe expected inter-annual variability in the radiation spectrum[54] confirmed that these records alone could not be expectedTable 2 Characteristics of spectrally resolved instruments highlighted in Fig. 1bInstrument name Spectral range Spectral resolution Spatial resolution(at nadir) ( km)Temporal coverage (launchdate to end of instrumentoperation)InfraRed Interferometer Spectrometer(IRIS-D) [19]400\u20131600 cm\u22121 2.8 cm\u22121 100 April 1970\u2013January 1971Spectrometer/Interferometer of theGerman Democratic Republic(SI-GDR) [20]400\u20131600 cm\u22121 5.0 cm\u22121 23 June 1977\u2013September 1977(Meteor-28)January 1979\u2013June 1979(Meteor-29)Interferometric Monitor forGreenhouse Gases (IMG) [21]650\u20133000 cm\u22121(3 contiguous bands)0.1 to 0.25 cm\u22121,varying with band8 October 1996\u2013June 1997Scanning Imaging AbsorptionSpectrometer for AtmosphericCartography (SCIAMACHY) [22]240\u20132380 nm(3 non-contiguousbands)0.22\u20131.48 nm 30 \u00d7 240 March 2002\u2013May 2012Atmospheric Infrared Sounder(AIRS) [23]650\u20132665 cm\u22121(3 non-contiguousbands)0.4\u20132.1 cm\u22121,varying with band13.5 May 2002\u2013presentInfrared Atmospheric SoundingInstrument (IASI) [24]645\u20132760 cm\u22121(3 contiguous bands)0.5 cm\u22121 12 June 2007\u2013present(MetOp-A)September 2012\u2013present(MetOp-B)Cross-track Infrared Sounder(CrIS) [25]650\u20132550 cm\u22121(3 non-contiguousbands)0.625\u20132.5 cm\u22121,varying with bandand operational mode14 October 2011\u2013presentAll nominally have global coverage although note that spectra actually available from the GDR-SI instruments are very limited in both spatial andtemporal coverage [26]Curr Clim Change Repto yield insight into the response of the climate system to theforcing due primarily to their short duration and the samplingof IMG in particular.Recent Developments: 2000\u2013PresentSince early 2000, significant progress has been made inour ability to monitor changes in spectral OLR and usethis information to test climate models. The launch ofAIRS aboard the Aqua satellite in 2002, and the subse-quent longevity of the instrument, has meant that re-searchers have finally had the opportunity to test theevolution of the OLR spectrum as simulated by climatemodels against sustained hyperspectral measurements. Inconcert, rigorous approaches have been developed toidentify the spectral fingerprints of change and evaluatethe timescales on which these will emerge given con-founding factors such as natural variability and instru-ment calibration uncertainty [55]. These efforts have ledto initiatives to develop a new category of \u2018climatechange\u2019 satellite missions. Principal amongst these isthe Climate Absolute Radiance and RefractoryObservatory (CLARREO). Selected as a Tier-1 NASADecadal Survey mission in 2007 [56], CLARREOobjectives include the provision of in-orbit absolutelycalibrated spectral radiances, spanning the longwaveand shortwave domains, in concert with GPS radio oc-cultation measurements.Insights from AIRSHuang and Yung were perhaps the first to use AIRS observa-tions to directly evaluate the variability of the OLR spectrum[57]. They used Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) anal-ysis of the AIRS observations to investigate the modes ofspectral variability in different climate zones. Althoughemploying only 1 month of data, the authors showed that onthis timescale whilst the contrast between cloud top and sur-face temperature was the dominant factor in driving variabil-ity, the patterns and ordering of the modes varied with zone.The publication was the first in a series using AIRS toevaluate the performance of variants of the GeophysicalFluid Dynamics Laboratory general circulation model(GFDL). Huang et al. performed a detailed comparison of ayear of AIRS observations with simulated global mean radi-ance spectra over the global oceans [58]. The comparison wasable to diagnose biases in the model temperature and moisturefields and, more critically, demonstrate that the effects of thesebiases could compensate such that they would not be apparentabFig. 2 a Global, annual averagespectrally resolved OLR assimulated by MODTRAN5 usingCCSM3 output for selected yearsduring the twenty-first centuryunder the SRES A2 scenario.b Change in OLR relative to year2000. Regions of influence of keygreenhouse gases are indicatedCurr Clim Change Repin a comparison with broadband flux observations.Comparisons byHuang et al. between GFDL simulations overthe tropical oceans and clear-sky spectrally resolved flux spec-tra derived from AIRS and the Clouds and the Earth\u2019s RadiantEnergy System (CERES) broadband radiometer yielded sim-ilar findings [59] (Fig. 4). The studies also showed that incor-porating extra dimensions beyond the spectral to theobservation-model comparison added significant discrimina-tory power. For example, temporal-spatial behaviour wasexploited to identify day-night model-observation biases con-sistent with an incorrect phasing of model convection over theIndian Ocean and Indonesian warm pool [58]. Similarly,Huang et al. were able to suggest a dynamical cause for thediscrepancies seen in the water vapour absorption bands byspatially and seasonally decomposing their results [59].Comparisons of model-observed spectral cloud-radiative forc-ing by the same authors illustrated marked discrepancies with-in specific cloud regimes that were not seen when results wereaveraged over larger spatial domains [60].Focusing more on factors related to climate sensitivity,Huang and Ramaswamy investigated the spectral variationin the super greenhouse effect (SGE) as manifested in AIRSand GFDL [61]. The SGE phenomenon, essentially a stronganti-correlation between sea surface temperature (SST) andOLR within the tropics, has a strong regional pattern, tendingto occur as zones transition between ascent and descent due tothe seasonal shift of the Hadley circulation [62]. Analysis ofobserved and modelled OLR spectra in SGE regions demon-strated the ability to identify compensating errors not only inthe mean model spectrum but also in the responses of cloudand the water vapour vertical distribution to a changing SST.FeedbacksThe AIRS studies indicated the power of using spectral obser-vations to directly test climate model performance, but tech-niques to formally discriminate between different feedbacksand unambiguously detect change using radiance spectraneeded development. Recognising this, Leroy et al. derivedfeedback signals due to temperature and water vapour changesrealised by an ensemble of the World Climate ResearchProgramme\u2019s Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase3 (CMIP3) climate models under a particular emissions sce-nario [63]. They showed an optimal detection technique, in-corporating uncertainty in the spectral shape of the feedbacksignals, could be used to distinguish different signals. Theyalso noted the dominant role of inter-annual variability in de-termining the accuracy with which a particular feedback couldbe identified given a 20-year record length.Although this study provided a framework, the calculationswere limited to clear-sky conditions. Using a doubled CO2climate model simulation, Huang et al. extended the work toseparate feedbacks due to temperature, water vapour and, cru-cially, cloud, in different vertical layers [16]. Key findingsrelated to the similarity between certain feedback signals(Fig. 5) and the impact of uncertainties in the spectral shapeof a given fingerprint. Whilst tropospheric temperature andwater vapour feedbacks were unambiguously detected forthe particular model and forcing scenario considered,distinguishing between cloud and surface temperature feed-back signals was difficult. The authors used their results tomake the case for auxiliary observations that could helpresolve the ambiguity. They highlighted the potential ofshortwave spectral reflectance to separate low cloudfrom surface temperature response and the use of GPSradio occultation measurements to disentangle atmo-spheric temperature and humidity responses, innovationspromised by the CLARREO mission.abcFig. 3 Examples of IRIS and IMG observed and simulated spectra for a3-month average (April\u2013June) over selected regions. a Observed IRISand IMG clear-sky brightness temperature spectra for the central Pacific(10\u00b0 N\u201310\u00b0 S, 130\u00b0 W\u2013180\u00b0 W). b Top, observed difference spectrumtaken from (a); middle, simulated central Pacific difference spectrum,displaced by \u20135 K; bottom, observed difference spectrum for \u2018near-global\u2019 case (60\u00b0 N\u201360\u00b0 S), displaced by \u201310 K. c component ofsimulated spectrum due to trace gas changes only. \u2018Brightnesstemperature\u2019 is the equivalent blackbody temperature. (Taken fromHarries et al. [52])Curr Clim Change RepUnlocking Information from the RSW SpectrumThe previous sections highlight the relatively large body ofwork concerned with discerning climate forcing and feedbackprocesses directly from OLR spectral radiances. Analogousefforts utilising the shortwave spectrum are less well-devel-oped. However, the realisation that the two regions containcomplementary information regarding key feedback process-es, particularly those involving cloud, coupled with the avail-ability of hyperspectral observations of RSW, has motivated anumber of recent studies. Roberts et al. used reflected spectralradiances from the Scanning Imaging AbsorptionSpectrometer for Atmospheric Cartography (SCIAMACHY)to quantify and attribute the variability in the hyperspectralobservations covering the ultraviolet (0.3 \u03bcm) through to thenear infrared (1.75 \u03bcm) [64]. Employing principal componentanalysis (PCA) techniques similar to those employed in OLRstudies, they showed that for all of the cases studied, six com-ponents or fewer explain over 95 % of the variance in theSCIAMACHY spectra. Perhaps more interestingly, they wereable to relate specific PCs to variations in cloud, water vapour,vegetation and sea ice. An alternative approach to characterisevariability was proposed by Jin et al. who derived spectralradiative kernels to explore the sensitivity of the RSW spec-trum to perturbations of individual parameters such as watervapour, aerosol optical depth and cloud properties. Theyfound, at low-mid latitudes, interannual variability in theRSW spectrum was generally dominated by variability incloud amount and optical depth [65]. At higher latitudes, snowand sea ice played a more important role. Whilst theseeffects dominate at wavelengths below \u223c1.3 \u03bcm, theimpact of water vapour and cloud height variability ismanifested within the strong water vapour absorptionbands across the RSW spectrum.Fig. 4 a Annual mean broadband clear-sky OLR (in W m\u22122) over thetropical oceans simulated by AM2 (Atmospheric GCM, GFDL) for 2004.b Difference between the AM2-simulated and AIRS inferred broadbandclear-sky OLR. c, d As (a) and (b) but for the spectral flux over thecombined bands of 0\u2013560 and 1400\u20132200 cm\u22121. e\u2013h As (c) and (d) butfor the spectral ranges of 560\u2013800 and 990\u20131070 cm\u22121, respectively.

Both the sign and spatialdistribution of the simulated versus observed differences in the spectrallyintegrated OLR can change when compared with equivalent differencesin selected spectral bands. (Adapted from Huang et al. [59])Curr Clim Change RepFocusing more on longer-term signals of change that mightbe expected to emerge in the RSW spectrum as the Earth\u2019sclimate evolves, Feldman et al. pioneered the idea of applyingtechniques usually employed in the planning of missions orObserving System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs), to cli-mate model output [17]. Coupling CMIP3 simulation resultsfrom Community Climate System Model 3 (CCSM3) withradiative transfer modelling across the shortwave domainand applying statistical detection techniques, Feldman et al.were able to determine, as a function of wavelength and zonalband, when the reflectance trend associated with a particularclimate model simulation would emerge from the underlying\u2018natural\u2019 variability, or the \u2018time-to-change-detection\u2019 [66].Focusing on simulations employing the Special Report onEmissions Scenarios (SRES) A2 emission scenario [67], theyfound that across much of the spectrum, for both clear and all-sky conditions, trends tended to emerge earlier in spectrallyresolved reflectances than in broadband albedo (Fig. 6).Typically, signals were faster to emerge at low-mid latitudescompared to higher latitudes, with underlying variability dueto cloud accounting for an increase in detection time betweenthe clear and all-sky cases.Bringing It Together: a Pan-Spectral Approachand the Question of Natural VariabilityFollowing up on their initial OSSE work, Feldman et al.exploited CMIP3 runs of CCSM3 at a variety of spatialresolutions to investigate whether pan-spectral informa-tion, incorporating both the RSW and longwave re-gimes, could discriminate between models exhibitingdifferent climate sensitivities [68].

Bluecurves show the all-sky global mean normalised spectral radiancechange (\u03b4RN) due to the change seen in CO2, surface temperature,tropospheric temperature, stratospheric temperature, tropospherichumidity, stratospheric humidity and lower, middle and uppertropospheric cloud. Red curves represent the spatial standard deviationin the \u03b4RN values across the globe and can be interpreted as a measure ofthe \u2018noise\u2019 in the change signal. Strong similarities in the spectral shape of\u03b4RN can clearly be seen in the temperature and low cloud panels (bluecurves) indicating the difficulty associated with separating theseresponses from each other. (Taken from Huang et al. [16])Curr Clim Change Repthe study goal, to distinguish between models showingdifferent low cloud and sea ice feedback strengths, theRSW domain was shown to have greater sensitivity al-though the longwave window region between 8 and12 \u03bcm also showed promising discriminatory ability.More recent work using output from the HadGEM2-ESand MIROC5 models to simulate multi-decadal spectraltrends for a given climate change scenario reiterates thepotential of pan-spectral information [27\u2022]. Differencesbetween the two models are apparent in both the RSWand longwave spectral domains (Fig. 7). To fully exploitthe spectral dimension requires an understanding of theprocesses which affect the response at different wave-lengths (by, for example, constructing pan-spectral radi-ative kernels). However, using information contained inboth the solar and outgoing longwave regimes simulta-neously has the potential to enable feedback processesthat appear degenerate when considering either regimein isolation [16, 65] to be distinguished from oneanother.Clearly, a model needs to accurately capture natural vari-ability to reliably inform on when a climate change signalmight be detectable. In the RSW domain, attempts have beenmade to compare the variabil i ty diagnosed fromSCIAMACHY with that captured by the CCSM3 OSSE sim-ulations. Roberts et al. used a PCA approach to show that, forselected observation rich months, the two data sets share alarge fraction of their spectral variability. This suggests thatthe OSSE is adequately capturing the spectral variability of theearly twenty-first century as observed by SCIAMACHY [69].a bc dFig. 6 a Time when the reflectance trend emerges from the underlying\u2018natural\u2019 variability (\u2018time-to-change-detection\u2019) as a function ofwavelength and zonal band as realised in MODTRAN5 simulations oftwenty-first century nadir clear-sky reflectance using output from theCCSM3 model under the SRES A2 scenario. b As (a) but whiteregions show where detection times are the same or faster usingspectrally integrated broadband albedo. c As (a) for all-sky conditions.d As (b) for all-sky conditions. The approach used to derive each panelfollows that described in Feldman et al. [66]Curr Clim Change RepJin et al., focusing on interannual variability over relativelylarge spatial domains, showed the normalised OSSE andSCIAMACHY reflectance variabilities are both typically lessthan 1 % across the RSW spectrum for all regions considered.Their work also highlighted a reduction in inter-annual vari-ability as spatial and temporal averaging scale increases, witha reduction of \u223c50 % when moving from monthly to annualaverages [70\u2022].Similar work assessing the variability manifested in theOSSE simulations in the longwave regime has not yet beenformally reported. However, there are studies providing in-sight into short-term variability using observations fromAIRS and more recently from the Infrared AtmosphericSounding Interferometer (IASI). Using IASI data, Brindleyet al. found interannual variability reduces across thelongwave spectrum as spatial scale increases but the rate ofreduction varies with spectral region [71\u2022]. As scale increases,variability across the atmospheric window, most sensitive tosurface temperature and cloud, reduces relatively rapidly, butthe reduction in variability is smaller for spectral regions sen-sitive to mid-upper troposphere temperature and water vapour(Fig. 8). At the global scale, interannual variability across theentire spectrum is less than 0.17 mWm\u22122 cm sr\u22121, reducing to0.05 mW m\u22122 cm sr\u22121 in the window. A similar magnitude ofspectral interannual variability had previously been reportedfrom an analysis of AIRS data, but the spectral shape of thevariability was markedly different [72]. The quality of recentradiance inter-comparisonsmade betweenAIRS, IASI and theCross-Track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) suggests that this differ-ence is most likely due to the different periods considered byFig. 7 Pan-spectral all-skydecadal trends in shortwavereflectance and longwaveradiance for the HadGEM2-ESand MIROC5 models under theIPCC AR5 RCP8.5 scenario overthe period 2005\u20132035 averagedover the Arctic (70\u201390\u00b0 N,0\u2013100\u00b0 E) (top) and the tropicalwestern Pacific (10\u00b0 S\u201310\u00b0 N,100\u2013150\u00b0 E) (bottom). (Takenfrom Feldman et al. [27\u2022])Curr Clim Change Repthe two analyses [73]. However, it would be interesting tocarry out a similar study over a common period to confirmthat this is indeed the case.Conclusions and Future DirectionsThe work highlighted in this review article illustrates the prog-ress that has been made in measuring and interpreting theoutgoing energy spectrum of the Earth across both the short-wave and longwave domains over the last five decades. A keyadvance concerns the direct use of spectral observations toquantitatively evaluate climate models. These comparisonshave identified inadequacies in climate model representationsof processes relating to the response of cloud, water vapourand temperature that could not be diagnosed from broadband,spectrally integrated measurements because of compensatingeffects across the spectrum. As such, they provide an illustra-tion of why such measurements could prove invaluable inreducing the uncertainty range that is currently associated withprojections of future climate change [74].Considering our future climate, this article has highlightedthat whilst the potential of directly using spectrally resolvedmeasurements to diagnose and attribute changes in climateforcing and feedbacks has been recognised for over 40 years,it is only relatively recently that hyperspectral measurementshave been of sufficient quality and duration to begin to quan-tify the observed variability in the reflected shortwave andoutgoing longwave spectrum over annual timescales and lon-ger. Such assessments are crucial, as they provide insight intowhen specific signatures associated with, for example, expect-ed changes in greenhouse gases, aerosol or cloud might beexpected to emerge from this \u2018natural\u2019 variability. Moreover,with careful consideration of instrument sampling character-istics, these data can be used to evaluate whether our currentgeneration of current climate and earth systemmodels are ableto capture the observed spectral variability. It should be notedthat the effort required to transform climate model output suchthat it can be directly compared with the observed metrics(radiance, reflectance, etc.) is not trivial [27\u2022]. Nonetheless,similar \u2018satellite simulators\u2019 have already been developed foractive and narrow-band passive instruments [75] and haveabFig. 8 a Standard deviation in 10\u00b0 zonal, annual mean all-sky brightnesstemperature spectra derived from IASI for the northern hemisphere for theperiod 2008\u20132012. b As (a) but for the global mean spectra. Note thechange in scale between (a) and (b). Variability in the atmosphericwindow (\u223c800\u20131250 cm\u22121, excluding the ozone band centred at1040 cm\u22121) reduces more rapidly with spatial scale than in thewavelength region between 700 and 750 cm\u22121 (sensitive on these timescales to variations in upper tropospheric temperature) and atwavenumbers greater than 1250 cm\u22121 (sensitive to variations inmid-upper tropospheric temperature and water vapour). (Adaptedfrom Brindley et al. [71\u2022])Curr Clim Change Repbeen used to investigate the ability of a variety of differentclimate models to correctly capture the seasonality associatedwith different cloud regimes [76] and to diagnose the reasonsfor specific common climate model biases [77]. We advocatethat developing this capability further for hyperspectral obser-vations should be a high priority. Such an effort would beparticularly timely given current and planned future instru-mentation (e.g. AIRS, IASI, CrIS, IASI-NG [78]) and couldpotentially incorporate developments in our ability to performfast, accurate, high spectral resolution radiative transfer calcu-lations [79] whilst retaining consistency with assumptionsmade internally within the relevant models [80].Aligned with the need for the development of suitable toolsto directly exploit the information contained in pan-spectralobservations, there must also be recognition that, whilst thecurrent generations of hyperspectral instruments are providingobservations of unprecedented quality, they were not designedspecifically for climate change monitoring. Indeed, we wouldcontend that there is currently no hyperspectral instrument inspace that possesses the level of in-orbit, SI traceable calibra-tion or sampling characteristics needed to provide a bench-mark record of the true climate state. Efforts are ongoing torectify this situation via, for example, the CLARREO [81\u2022\u2022]and Traceable Radiometry Underpinning Solar and TerrestrialStudies (TRUTHS) initiatives [82]. A CLARREO Pathfindermission is scheduled for launch in 2020 on-board theInternational Space Station with the goal to demonstrate thetarget in-orbit calibration accuracy across the RSW domain,and efforts continue to secure funding for the full mission(currently scheduled for launch no earlier than 2023).Implementation of missions with such benchmarking ca-pability is key to understanding discrepancies betweencontemporaneous measurements from different instru-ments and, more critically, to being able to make robustclaims concerning real spectral changes that have oc-curred between observing periods when the instrumentalrecord is not continuous in time [83].Finally, we would also note what we consider to be a majormissing piece in our understanding of the response of theEarth\u2019s energy budget to climate change. Although in theglobal mean, approximately half of the Earth\u2019s OLR is locatedat wavelengths greater than \u223c15 \u03bcm, within the so-called far-infrared (FIR) [84], the region has never been measured spec-trally, in its entirety, from space. The FIR is highly sensitive tomid-upper tropospheric water vapour and to cirrus cloud, bothof which critically influence the Earth\u2019s radiative budget andclimate sensitivity [74]. Moreover, very recent work has sug-gested that the FIR may have a more important role thanpreviously recognised in modulating high-latitude climate re-sponse and future change [85, 86]. We suggest that futuremissions capable of providing spectrally resolved measure-ments across this regionwould ensure we can have confidencewe are correctly characterising the full OLR spectrum acrossthe complete range of Earth scenes and address a long-standing shortcoming in our observational capabilities.Acknowledgments The authors would like to acknowledge DanielFeldman, Yi Huang and Xianglei Huang for kindly supplying data andmodified figures for this manuscript.

As the\nocean has a much longer memory than the atmosphere,\nlarge volcanic eruptions have a long lasting impact on\nthe climate system that extends beyond the duration\nof the volcanic forcing (e.g., Stenchikov et al., 2009;\nZanchettin et al., 2012).\nThe most recent and regarding its climate im-\npact best-observed large volcanic eruption was that of\nMt. Pinatubo, Philippines, in June 1991. By now it is\nwell established that this eruption led to global surface\ncooling for a period of about seven years, reaching a\nmaximum of about 0.4 K one to two years after the erup-\ntion (Thompson et al., 2009). In addition, sea level fall\n(Church et al., 2005), significant changes in the hy-\ndrological cycle (Trenberth and Dai, 2007), strato-\nspheric warming, and a significant ozone loss in the mid-\nlatitudes over the northern hemisphere (NH, note that\nall acronyms are defined in the Glossary at the end of\nthe article) (Pawson et al., 2014) have been observed.\nSince the 1991 Mt. Pinatubo eruption, several small to\nmoderate volcanic eruptions have affected the upper tro-\nposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) aerosol layer\n(Figure 1), with SO2 emissions up to about an order\nof magnitude smaller than Mt. Pinatubo. The effects of\nthese eruptions on climate are not as pronounced as for\neruptions like Mt. Pinatubo, but are still relevant in many\nrespects. Neglecting them likely contributed to an over-\nestimation of projected global warming by climate mod-\nels compared to the observed global temperature record\nafter 2000 (Solomon et al., 2011; Smith et al., 2016), as\nthe eruptions affected the aerosol radiative forcing (e.g.,\nSanter, 2014; Andersson et al., 2015).\nTo date, there has been no satellite instrument de-\nsigned specifically for the detection of volcanic gas\nand particles. Researchers have instead had to make\ndo with various existing Earth-observing instruments.\nA detailed survey of past, ongoing and future satel-\nlite missions relevant for volcanic sulfur and ash detec-\ntion can be found in Prata (2016). Carn et al. (2016)\nprovided an overview of multi-decadal satellite mea-\nsurements of global volcanic degassing. At the time of\nthe Mt. Pinatubo eruption, only a few satellite instru-\nments (HALOE and SAGE II) were able to provide ob-\nservations relevant to volcanic aerosol (SPARC (2006)\nand references therein). Since then several new satellite\ninstruments have become operational (Kremser et al.,\n2016).\nDue to the wealth of satellite observations and ma-\njor modeling improvements, significant advances have\nbeen made in recent years in understanding the phys-\nical and chemical processes that determine the vol-\ncanic forcing and the consequent dynamical and cli-\nmatic responses of the coupled ocean\u2013atmosphere sys-\ntem (e.g., Timmreck, 2012; Raible et al., 2016). In ad-\ndition, much has been learned about the climate impact\nof small to moderate volcanic eruptions (e.g., Kremser\net al., 2016; Monerie et al., 2017; Schmidt et al., 2018).\nHowever, our knowledge is still dominated by \u201cbits and\npieces\u201d gleaned from a limited amount of observations\nand specific model studies of mostly large individual\neruptions, which differ in their eruption characteristics\n(e.g., Toohey et al., 2011; Stoffel et al., 2015; Hay-\nwood et al., 2013; Bittner et al., 2016a). In addition,\nthe scientific understanding of several effects of volcanic\neruptions is unsatisfactory. The difficulties start with the\nuncertain amount of emitted sulfur even for the best-\nobserved eruptions and the exact distribution, particle\nsize, and development of emitted material over time. Re-\nlated to this are uncertainties concerning the effects on\natmospheric composition, circulation and clouds, and,\nfinally, radiative forcing and climate.\nMeteorol. Z. (Contrib. Atm. Sci.)\n29, 2020\nC. von Savigny et al.: The Research Unit VolImpact 5\nFigure 2: Overview of the research unit.\n2 State of the Art\nThe following paragraphs provide brief overviews of the\nscientific knowledge and gaps in these areas with special\nemphasis on the state-of-the-art in terms of satellite\nobservations and numerical modelling capabilities of the\natmospheric response to volcanic eruptions.\nCrucial for the vertical distribution of volcanic emis-\nsions and their subsequent dispersion in the atmosphere\nis the dynamics of the convectively driven volcanic\nplume. Complex dynamical and chemical processes\nwithin the plume play an important role in controlling\nthe chemical composition and the vertical distribution of\nthe gases (Hoshyaripour, 2015), as well as the partic-\nulate matter lofted into the atmosphere, and thus in con-\ntrolling the radiative and climatic impact of the eruption.\nLarge uncertainties exist in our understanding of erup-\ntive plumes, especially in terms of the amount of vol-\ncanic emissions reaching the UTLS or higher altitudes,\nand the physicochemical characteristics of the injected\nmatter (Textor et al., 2005; Van Eaton et al., 2012).\nFor instance, the 2011 Nabro eruption, which emitted\n1.0\u20131.5 Tg SO2 (Clarisse et al., 2014), was a complex\nevent for which it was difficult to separate the upper\ntropospheric and lower stratospheric injections (Carn\net al., 2016).\nThe amount and vertical distribution of SO2 emit-\nted by the Mt. Pinatubo eruption are still highly uncer-\ntain and debated in recent studies (e.g., Mann et al.,\n2015; Kremser et al., 2016; Mills et al., 2016). In-\nterestingly, to reach the best agreement with observa-\ntions of stratospheric aerosol optical depth (SAOD) and\naerosol lifetimes, some recent global aerosol modelling\nstudies (e.g., Mills et al., 2016; Feinberg et al., in re-\nview) support smaller stratospheric sulfur amounts than\nthose inferred from satellite observations (Guo et al.,\n2004). This discrepancy between observations and mod-\nelling studies needs to be understood, in particular to re-\nduce the uncertainty of predictions of the effects of fu-\nture volcanic eruptions.\nThe chemical and radiative effects of volcanic aerosol\nare strongly influenced by the particle size distribution\n(PSD), which may change significantly over time after a\nvolcanic eruption. Observational information about the\nvolcanic PSD is therefore essential for providing most\nrealistic volcanic forcing estimates and for validating\nand constraining global aerosol models, which are sen-\nsitive to the applied aerosol model configuration (e.g.,\nMann et al., 2015). Obtaining these quantities \u2013 which\nare poorly constrained (Kremser et al., 2016) \u2013 from re-\nmote sensing measurements requires comprehensive in-\nversions. At present, information on the volcanic PSD\nfrom satellite observations is limited and typically re-\nstricted to only a single particle size parameter, e.g., ef-\nfective radius or the mode radius of a log-normal distri-\nbution with fixed width (e.g., Bourassa et al., 2008; Za-\nlach et al., in review). In some studies the median radius\nand the distribution width of an assumed mono-modal\n6 C. von Savigny et al.: The Research Unit VolImpact Meteorol. Z. (Contrib. Atm. Sci.)\n29, 2020\nlog-normal PSD are retrieved (Bingen et al., 2003; Bin-\ngen et al., 2004; Wurl et al., 2010; Malinina et al.,\n2018). Existing in-situ balloon observations show evi-\ndence for a bi-modal distribution with a main popula-\ntion of small particles and a second mode of particles\nwith radii on the order of 400\u2013500 nm (e.g., Deshler,\n2008). The exact origin of this second particle mode,\nparticularly under volcanically quiescent periods, is not\nwell understood.\nA few studies provided experimental evidence of di-\nrect volcanic H2O injections into the lower stratosphere\n(Schwartz et al., 2013; Sioris et al., 2016), where H2O\nhas a particularly strong effect on the radiative balance\nof the Earth system (Solomon et al., 2010). How this\naffects the tropical tropopause layer (TTL) and the cold-\npoint tropopause (CPT) is uncertain. In general circula-\ntion models (GCMs), often an increase of the CPT tem-\nperature is simulated (e.g., Joshi and Shine, 2003), but\nthis depends strongly on the characteristics of the pre-\nscribed aerosol distribution (Arfeuille et al., 2013). An\nincreased CPT temperature would theoretically lead to\nmore water vapour entering the stratosphere, with conse-\nquences for chemical composition and radiative forcing,\nbut due to the potential artifacts in satellite observations\nof water vapour caused by volcanic aerosols, there is no\nclear observational indication of such an effect even for\nMt. Pinatubo (Fueglistaler et al., 2013).\nThe responses of different types of clouds to pertur-\nbations due to volcanic eruptions are uncertain. A vol-\ncanic aerosol effect on cirrus clouds in the upper tropo-\nsphere has been discussed controversially in the litera-\nture (e.g., Campbell et al., 2012; Friberg et al., 2015;\nMeyer et al., 2015), and possible effects are not well\nunderstood. Several observational studies provide indi-\ncations for volcanically-induced effects on cirrus cloud\nformation after Mt. Pinatubo (e.g., Sassen, 1992; Song\net al., 1996). Concerning low-level clouds, tropospheric\nvolcanic sources were one of the primary sources of\ncloud condensation nuclei (CCN) in the preindustrial at-\nmosphere (Schmidt et al., 2012). Global model studies\n(e.g., Gettelman, 2015; Rap et al., 2013) and obser-\nvations (McCoy and Hartmann, 2015) have indicated\nthe capacity of tropospheric volcanic emissions to af-\nfect low level cloud properties. Malavelle et al. (2017)\nhave shown that the 2014\u20132015 eruption of the icelandic\nHoluhraun volcano has modestly influenced the effec-\ntive radius of cloud droplets in the North Atlantic re-\ngion, but not the cloud liquid water path, different to\nwhat some models have simulated. It is unclear which\nmechanisms lead to such an apparent buffering of the\naerosol effect on clouds (Toll et al., 2019). Model stud-\nies (Toohey et al., 2011; Gregory et al., 2016) suggest\nthat rapid cloud adjustments damp the radiative forcing\nand global mean forcing of major volcanic eruptions.\nIndeed, much can be learned about aerosol-cloud\ninteractions from such eruptions or effusive eruptions\nalso from other volcanoes. The limiting factor is, how-\never, the availability of observational data for particular\neruptions. The eruptions of Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull (2010) and\nHoluhraun (2014) are especially interesting for aerosol-\ncloud interaction studies, because both eruptions are\nvery well-constrained from modeling and measurement\nperspectives (e.g., Steinke et al., 2011; Vogel et al.,\n2014; Malavelle et al., 2017). In particular, these two\neruptions provided unique opportunities to constrain the\neffects of volcanic aerosols on ice clouds (Seifert et al.,\n2011) and liquid clouds (Malavelle et al., 2017). This\nresearch background not only provides extensive data\nbut also lays the ground for comparison studies.\nDespite considerable scientific attention, the dynam-\nical response of the atmosphere to volcanic aerosols re-\nmains poorly understood. Observations and early mod-\neling studies suggest for example a robust strengthening\nof the Arctic polar vortex as a consequence of enhanced\ndiabatic heating of the tropical lower stratosphere by\nvolcanic aerosols (Robock, 2000). However, only weak\nenhancements of the Arctic polar vortex can be diag-\nnosed from CMIP5 climate model simulations (Bitt-\nner et al., 2016b; Zambri and Robock, 2016). Inad-\nequacies in the simulated dynamical response may be\nrelated to the prescribed volcanic forcing sets used in\nsimulations (Toohey et al., 2014), which have generally\nnot included aspects of volcanic aerosol forcing that are\nnow understood to be important, e.g., the variability of\naerosols within the lowermost extratropical stratosphere\n(Andersson et al., 2015; Ridley et al., 2014). This is\nparticularly relevant for the small-to-moderate 21st cen-\ntury eruptions.\nMany aspects of the large-scale atmospheric circula-\ntion \u2013 especially in the middle atmosphere \u2013 are driven\nby waves. However, few studies (e.g., Toohey et al.,\n2014; Bittner et al., 2016a) have specifically addressed\nthe volcanic impact on wave propagation and breaking.\nFor example, the mesospheric residual circulation and\nthe mesospheric temperature field are controlled by the\nbreaking of gravity waves, and observed post-volcanic\nmesospheric anomalies (e.g., She et al., 2015; Hervig\net al., 2016) are likely mediated by changes in gravity\nwave breaking, although the mechanisms remain unex-\nplored.\nA complete picture of the volcanic effects on sur-\nface climate is still missing. Most challenging is the vol-\ncanic imprint on tropical hydroclimate, which is highly\ninfluenced by internal variability. It has been demon-\nstrated that volcanic eruptions influence the interhemi-\nspheric energy budget (e.g., Haywood et al., 2013) and\nmodulate the African and Asian Monsoon systems (e.g.,\nOman et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2016), impacting areas\nthat are now home to \u223c60 % of the world\u2019s popula-\ntion. The recent generation of climate models is capable\nof reproducing the main characteristics of the observed\nprecipitation response to volcanic forcing quite reason-\nably, but they significantly underestimate the magnitude\nof the regional responses in specific seasons (Iles and\nHegerl, 2014). According to the analysis by Paik and\nMin (2017), models show a weaker response in latent\nheat flux and 500 hPa vertical motion, which could be a\ncritical factor for their underestimation of precipitation\nMeteorol.

This questions their capability for providing\nreliable future predictions of changes in the tropical wa-\nter cycle.\n3 Aims and objectives\nAs outlined above, the scientific understanding of vol-\ncanic aerosols and their effects has improved during the\nlast decade. Nevertheless, many relevant processes are\nstill poorly understood. Due to new developments in ob-\nservational and modelling capabilities we will now be\nable to answer questions that could not be addressed be-\nfore. A sound understanding of the different processes\ninvolved will help us to more reliably predict climate\neffects of future volcanic eruptions, which may be dif-\nferent under future climate conditions. The overarching\ngoal of the research unit VolImpact is to improve the sci-\nentific understanding of crucial aspects of volcanic influ-\nence on the atmosphere and climate, taking advantage of\nnew developments in observational and modelling capa-\nbilities. This will enhance our capacity to quantify po-\ntential consequences of the next large volcanic eruption,\nto understand observed past climate variability, to deter-\nmine the ramifications of suggested climate engineering\nvia stratospheric aerosols and to design observing sys-\ntems, software tools and strategies that will allow us to\nlearn the most from future eruptions.\nWith the now available observational and modelling\ntools (see Section 5) we will be able to study the effects\nof volcanic eruptions consistently over the full range\nof spatial and temporal scales involved, i.e., from the\nprocesses in the initial plume during the first hours of\nthe eruption to the global dispersal and its consequences\nfrom the surface to the mesosphere. Such coupling of\nthe convective and planetary scales has not been possible\nbefore. Tackling the volcanic impacts on multiple scales\nwill allow us to significantly improve the knowledge of\nand reduce the uncertainties in a chain of closely linked\nprocesses, including:\n\u2022 the evolution of the eruptive plume\n\u2022 the growth of sulfate aerosols, their global spread and\nradiative properties\n\u2022 the effect of volcanic aerosols on clouds\n\u2022 the impact of volcanic radiative forcing on atmo-\nspheric circulation\n\u2022 the integrated impact of volcanic aerosols and feed-\nbacks on climate\nThese five aspects are also the central themes of the\nfive VolImpact science projects (see Section 4). For each\nof them, important and open science questions have been\nidentified that will be addressed by the corresponding\nproject. In the following five paragraphs, exemplary sci-\nence questions are discussed for each of the projects, in-\ncluding the goals with respect to the individual uncertain\nprocesses and the scientific approaches involved.\n1. How well can state-of-the-art models reproduce the\neffect of moist convection on the development of\neruption plumes and volcanogenic H2O injections\ninto the stratosphere and to what extent is the mod-\nelled chemical and microphysical evolution within\nthe plume dependent on model resolution?\nModelling approaches used so far do not allow for a\nconsistent treatment of both the plume development\nand the dispersal of the volcanic material (Textor\net al., 2005). A central goal of VolImpact is to over-\ncome the current modelling limitations and to pro-\nvide seamless simulations over scales relevant for\nthe initial plume development (<100 m) up to global\nscales. The ICON model system in combination with\nsatellite remote sensing data will provide the tools to\nbetter understand the plume development in the first\nfew hours to days of a volcanic eruption. Of particu-\nlar interest is the role of moist processes in determin-\ning the injection height profile of volcanic emissions.\nThe spatial resolution of the models employed signif-\nicantly affects the results obtained. For a given vol-\ncanic SO2 amount, the model grid and the prescribed\ninjection profile will affect the SO2 concentration in\nthe volcanic plume, and subsequently the simulation\nof microphysical processes. To reduce these uncer-\ntainties a very highly resolved region around the vol-\ncano is a prerequisite. The ICON model family pro-\nvides this unprecedented opportunity. This will of-\nfer new opportunities for investigating chemical and\nmicrophysical processes after volcanic eruptions and\ntheir interaction with atmospheric dynamics, clouds\nand precipitation, e.g., the effect of stratospheric H2O\ninjections directly through the eruption or indirectly\nthrough tropopause changes.\n2. What is the exact effect of volcanic eruptions on\nstratospheric aerosol particle size and what is the role\nof size changes for the overall chemical and radiative\neffects of volcanic eruptions?\nAn open key question in current stratospheric aerosol\nresearch is the variability of the PSD of volcanic\naerosols during and after an eruption (Robock,\n2015). Knowledge on the PSD and its variabil-\nity are essential for an accurate determination of\nthe chemical and radiative effects caused by vol-\ncanic eruptions. For this purpose various satellite\ndata sets \u2013 including past missions such as SCIA-\nMACHY as well as current missions, e.g., OMPS/LP\nand SAGE III/ISS \u2013 will be employed to retrieve par-\nticle size information. A sound understanding of the\ntemporal development of the aerosol size distribution\nand the processes involved is a prerequisite for eval-\nuating and validating global aerosol model simula-\ntions, which is necessary for providing reliable forc-\ning estimates of future eruptions.\n3. What are the effects of volcanic aerosols on clouds\nand what is the contribution of these aerosol-cloud\ninteractions to the overall effective radiative forcing\nassociated with volcanic eruptions?\n8 C. von Savigny et al.: The Research Unit VolImpact Meteorol. Z. (Contrib. Atm. Sci.)\n29, 2020\nApart from the direct aerosol effect related to scatter-\ning of solar radiation and absorption of terrestrial and\nsolar radiation, aerosol-cloud interactions potentially\nhave a significant impact on the overall effective ra-\ndiative forcing associated with volcanic eruptions.\nHowever, the scientific knowledge of volcanism-\nrelated cloud effects is particularly poor or lacking.\nSeveral essential microphysical processes related to\nthese uncertainties will be addressed by VolImpact.\nVolcanic aerosols serve as CCN and as such as a\nsource for cloud particles in the liquid phase, and \u2013\nvia homogeneous nucleation \u2013 in the ice phase. It is\nunclear to what extent volcanic aerosols may also\nserve as ice nucleating particles (INP) leaving their\ninfluence on heterogeneous nucleation of cloud ice\nan open question. For all pathways, the response\nof clouds beyond changes in cloud particle concen-\ntration is uncertain. Apart from this impact of the\nvolcanic aerosol on droplet and crystal formation,\nclouds also respond to the changes in surface tem-\nperature, as well as changes in the temperature and\nmoisture profiles, further adding to the effective ra-\ndiative forcing (e.g., Heyn et al., 2017), a response\nthat also is very poorly understood and quantified.\n4. How do the effects of volcanic eruptions on atmo-\nspheric dynamics depend on the specific character-\nistics of the eruptions and how does the dynamics of\nthe mesosphere respond to major volcanic eruptions?\nSome of the most important climatic anomalies re-\nlated to large volcanic eruptions involve changes in\nlarge-scale atmospheric circulation. Unfortunately,\nclimate models do not robustly reproduce many of\nthe expected dynamical responses to volcanic forc-\ning \u2013 a result which mirrors the uncertainties in future\nclimate projections due to non-robustness of sim-\nulated atmospheric circulation (Shepherd, 2014).\nOne important goal of the proposed research is to in-\nvestigate the sensitivity of the atmospheric dynam-\nical response to the specific distribution of the vol-\ncanic aerosol. To our best knowledge, volcanically\ninduced changes in the mesospheric residual circu-\nlation have not been investigated before, and will be\nused in VolImpact together with evidence from the\nstratosphere and troposphere to develop a holistic un-\nderstanding of the impact of volcanic aerosol on the\ndynamics in the whole atmosphere.\n5. What are the possible effects of volcanic eruptions\non the hydrological cycle and what conditions do\nspecific responses depend on?\nA fundamental and detailed understanding of the cli-\nmatic effects of future volcanic eruptions is essen-\ntial for prediction of weather and climatic anomalies\nin their aftermath. Most challenging is the volcanic\nimpact on the hydrological cycle, as aerosol-cloud\nprocesses are poorly understood and clouds rapidly\nadjust to volcanic forcing. The CMIP6 VolMIP ex-\nperiments (Zanchettin et al., 2016) can only an-\nswer part of these questions, as the experiments are\ndefined with a well constrained forcing for specific\neruptions (e.g., Pinatubo, early 19th century erup-\ntions). Together with the volcanic forcing generator\nEVA and sound statistical methods, the ICON based\nEarth system model (ICON-ESM) \u2013 which allows for\nhighly resolved global simulations \u2013 offers the pos-\nsibility to leap-frog current efforts and to provide a\nmore holistic picture of the volcanic-climate system.\nWe can now address open questions which could not\nbe answered adequately before, e.g., why current cli-\nmate models underestimate the observed precipita-\ntion decrease (e.g., Iles and Hegerl, 2014). The\nhigh-resolution ICON-ESM has the potential of tack-\nling this problem as increasing resolution of climate\nmodels improves the representation of complex and\nheterogeneous regions, such as the Maritime Conti-\nnent, and apparently increases the regionally aver-\naged latent heat flux and precipitation (Qian, 2008;\nSchiemann et al., 2014). A special goal is to under-\nstand the impact of the small-to-moderate 21st cen-\ntury volcanic eruptions on the hydrological cycle.\n4 Structure and organisation of the\nresearch unit\nVolImpact is a truly interdisciplinary project, integrating\ncomplementary expertise in satellite remote sensing of\natmospheric composition, stratospheric aerosol parame-\nters and clouds as well as in modelling of aerosol mi-\ncrophysical and cloud processes, and in climate mod-\nelling. Each member of VolImpact is an expert in a spe-\ncific discipline, but only as a consortium joined in a Re-\nsearch Unit do they provide the expertise necessary to\nanswer the challenging scientific questions related to the\nvolcanic impact on atmosphere and climate. With their\ndifferent backgrounds and tools the VolImpact partners\nform an excellent team that will be able to fulfill the\nproject objectives. The research goals outlined above\nare addressed in five individual science projects, which\nanswer the scientific questions and which are comple-\nmented by a coordination project. Each of the science\nprojects \u2013 briefly summarized below \u2013 will deal with one\nspecific aspect of VolImpact (see Figure 2).\nVolcanic Plume evolution and injection profiles (Vol-\nPlume) focuses on the initial plume development in the\nfirst few hours to days of a volcanic eruption by com-\nbining state-of-the-art atmospheric modelling and satel-\nlite remote sensing. The project will create the impor-\ntant capability to quickly carry out similar studies for\nfuture volcanic eruptions. This includes both the mod-\nelling framework and the satellite data retrieval algo-\nrithms. The project will also provide some of the model\ndevelopment and initial conditions relevant for the entire\nresearch unit.\nConstraining the effects of Volcanic Aerosol on Ra-\ndiative forcing and stratospheric Composition (VolARC)\naddresses the direct radiative effects of volcanic aerosols\nin the stratosphere. This project aims at (i) quantifying\nMeteorol. Z. (Contrib. Atm. Sci.)\n29, 2020\nC. von Savigny et al.: The Research Unit VolImpact 9\nthe temporal variability of stratospheric aerosol extinc-\ntion and PSD as well as radiative forcing using available\nsatellite data sets and state-of-the-art modelling capabil-\nities; (ii) improving current aerosol microphysical mod-\nelling capabilities to better link observed SO2 emission\nand AOD and thereby constraining volcanic SO2 emis-\nsion, e.g., of the 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo.\nCloud response to Volcanic eruptions (VolCloud)\ntreats the cloud response to volcanic eruptions due to\naerosol-cloud interactions and cloud adjustments mak-\ning use of a range of ICON simulations as well as of\nsatellite data. Two adjustment effects are investigated:\n(i) the microphysical response of clouds to the volcanic\naerosol, for liquid and ice clouds; and (ii) the response of\nthermodynamic profiles and the subsequent alteration of\ncloud distributions and properties, in collaboration with\nthe VolDyn and VolClim projects.\nVolcanic impacts on atmospheric Dynamics (Vol-\nDyn) investigates the impact of volcanic eruptions on\nthe dynamics of the atmosphere. It will focus on building\na mechanistic understanding of the dynamical responses\nto the direct radiative effects of volcanic aerosol, and the\nsensitivity of these responses to the structure of the forc-\ning. The area of focus includes the mesosphere, strato-\nsphere and troposphere, and the project will integrate re-\nsults from other projects of the research unit which help\ndefining the structure and uncertainty range of volcanic\nforcing based on observations and detailed modelling.\nVolcanic impact on surface Climate (VolClim) inves-\ntigates the impact of volcanic eruptions on surface cli-\nmate. The central goal of VolClim is to develop a con-\nceptual understanding of how volcanic eruptions influ-\nence tropical hydroclimate which helps estimating the\nimpact of future eruptions. The unique combination of\nthe highly resolved ICON-ESM with the volcanic forc-\ning generator EVA and advanced statistical methods will\nallow to assess how important specific eruption charac-\nteristics and the background climate state are for the vol-\ncanic influence on tropical hydroclimate. ICON-ESM\nmodel results will be jointly analyzed within VolImpact.\nWhile each project has its specific topic, all projects\nare interrelated in a chain of closely linked processes\nand contribute to the overall research themes. Tight links\nexist between the individual VolImpact projects due to\nthe fact that all groups use models of the ICON model\nsystem (Section 5.2) and focus on selected volcanic\neruptions.\nThe governance structure of the research unit com-\nprises a General Assembly (GA), a Steering Commit-\ntee (SC) consisting of the PIs of the individual projects\nand a project office located at the University of Greif-\nswald. The science results obtained will be published\nin open access journals and the retrieved and/or mod-\nelled data sets will be made publicly available under\nCC-BY 4.0 license. For both the VolImpact simulations\nand the VolImpact retrieval products a final long-term\narchiving is planned at DKRZ within the WDCC to al-\nlow analysis beyond the project period.\n5 Tools and methodology\n5.1 Observational data\nCentral for VolImpact is the analysis and exploitation\nof satellite data. Satellite measurements will be used in\ntwo different ways in VolImpact. Some of the research\nactivities will employ raw satellite data (Level 1 data) to\nretrieve relevant aerosol parameters (aerosol extinction\nand aerosol particle size information), e.g., in VolARC.\nIn addition, we will also make use of existing Level 2\nsatellite data of aerosol parameters, chemical composi-\ntion and the atmospheric background state.\nWe expect to greatly benefit from:\n(a) the daily near-global observations from the well-\nestablished limb-scatter instruments (OSIRIS (Lle-\nwellyn et al., 2004); SCIAMACHY (Bovensmann\net al., 1999); OMPS-LP (Jaross et al., 2014)) and the\nrecently launched and upcoming satellite missions\nincluding SAGE III/ISS (launched in 2017), Earth-\nCARE (scheduled for launch in 2021) and ALTIUS\n(Fussen et al., 2016) (currently scheduled for launch\nin 2022), which provide high-resolution observations\nof aerosols, clouds, and aerosol-cloud interactions.\n(b) multi-spectral observations of the scattered or trans-\nmitted solar radiance which allow the retrieval of\nmore than one parameter of the aerosol particle size\ndistribution \u2013 a key variable for volcanic forcing con-\nstraints.\n(c) advanced optical observations to retrieve the vol-\ncanic plume geometry, such as MISR multi-angle ob-\nservations and geostationary observations with high\nspatio-temporal resolution.\n(d) cloud property retrievals by active remote sensing\n(CloudSat and CALIPSO) for evaluation of the sim-\nulation of perturbed and unperturbed liquid and ice\nclouds.\nTable 1 provides an overview of the satellite datasets\nwe plan to use within the individual projects. A depic-\ntion of the temporal coverage of past, current and future\nsatellite missions providing stratospheric aerosol mea-\nsurements is given in Figure 3. Regarding future satel-\nlite measurements, the short term prospects for global\nspace-based aerosol measurements are excellent with\nobservations from OSIRIS, CALIPSO and OMPS-LP\nexpected to last several more years. Furthermore, the\nnew SAGE-III instrument was successfully deployed\non the International Space Station (ISS) in early 2017.\nThe SAGE-III instrument on ISS is an improved ver-\nsion of the SAGE-III/Meteor-3M instrument that pro-\nvided stratospheric aerosol observations from 2002 to\n2006 (e.g., Thomason et al., 2008). The EarthCARE\nmission, conducted jointly between the European Space\nAgency (ESA) and the Japanese Aerospace Exploration\nAgency (JAXA), will provide highly valuable observa-\ntions of clouds and aerosols. It will, e.g., be capable\n10 C. von Savigny et al.: The Research Unit VolImpact Meteorol. Z. (Contrib. Atm.

From the\nremote sensing perspective, the next moderate to large\nvolcanic eruptions will very likely be well character-\nized through the retrieval of optical, microphysical and\ngeometrical properties of both volcanic ash and sulfate\naerosol provided by a range of complementary Earth-\nobserving platforms.\nIn VolImpact other observational data will also be\nused. Collaborations with different in-situ and remote\nsensing measurement groups are planned including the\nNetwork for Observation of Volcanic and Atmospheric\nChange (NOVAC), the Network for the Detection of\nAtmospheric Composition Change (NDACC), IAGOS-\nCARIBIC and the upcoming Strateole-2 balloon cam-\npaign.\n5.2 Models and Forcing data\nIn VolImpact the ICON modeling framework will be\napplied to better understand the impacts of volcanic\neruptions from the dynamics of the eruption plume\nto global climate effects. The ICON model is a joint\ndevelopment of the German Weather Service (DWD)\nand the Max Planck Institute of Meteorology Ham-\nburg (MPIM). ICON scales very efficiently on mas-\nsively parallel computers and is therefore especially\nsuited to run on current high performance computing ar-\nchitectures. The atmospheric component of the ICON\nmodel system has been developed around a dynamical\ncore that solves the fully compressible non-hydrostatic\nequations, and includes a mass conserving tracer trans-\nport scheme. Three packages for parameterisations of\nsubgrid-scale diabatic and turbulent processes have been\ndeveloped for climate simulations at a grid resolution of\n\u223c100 km (ICON-A, Giorgetta et al. (2018); Crueger\net al. (2018)), numerical weather prediction at a grid res-\nolution of \u223c10 km (ICON-NWP, Z\u00e4ngl et al. (2015))\nand large eddy simulations at grid resolutions down to\n\u223c100 m (ICON-LEM, Heinze et al. (2017)). The model\nallows for global or regional simulations and has the op-\ntion for online nesting with multiple refinement levels.\nIn VolImpact we will also apply the UA-ICON, an\nextension of ICON to the Upper Atmosphere, more\nspecifically up to the lower thermosphere (Borchert\net al., 2019) and the fully-coupled aerosol and chem-\nistry extension ICON-ART. ICON-ART has been de-\nveloped at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)\n(Rieger et al., 2015). ART stands for Aerosols and Re-\nactive Trace gases and simulates atmospheric chem-\nistry and aerosol microphysics, and related feedback\nprocesses. Currently, a version of ICON-ART is being\njointly developed by MPI-M and KIT to simulate strato-\nspheric ozone on a global scale. ICON-ART allows a\ntwo-way nesting to consider specific areas with a high\nresolution. Such nests will be employed around volca-\nnoes. The climate effect of the volcanic eruptions will\nbe addressed with the ICON-based coupled Earth sys-\ntem model (ICON-ESM) which is currently in the test-\ning phase. The first version consists of the atmosphere\nFigure 4: Schematic overview of the range of spatial and temporal\nscales of the ICON models to be used in VolImpact.\nmodel ICON-A at 160 km grid resolution with 47 lay-\ners up to 80 km height and the ICON-O ocean model\n(Korn, 2017) at 40 km resolution with 64 vertical lay-\ners. The land component ICON-L which is embedded\nin ICON-A, is based on the JSBACH model (Reick\net al., 2013). The ocean component ICON-O is a hydro-\nstatic general circulation model and includes also a dy-\nnamic/thermodynamic sea-ice model and the ocean bio-\ngeochemistry sub-model HAMOCC.\nThe ICON model family provides a unique model-\ning framework that allows to directly link simulations\nof the volcanic plume, aerosol microphysics and cli-\nmate (see Figure 4). Starting with large eddy simulations\nwith ICON-LEM in VolPlume, the chain of model con-\nfigurations evolves via ICON-NWP simulations in Vol-\nCloud to global simulations with ICON-A/UA-ICON\n(VolARC, VolDyn) and with ICON-ESM (VolClim).\nUsing models from the same model system will fos-\nter synergies between the individual VolImpact projects.\nOne of the great advantages of ICON(-ART) is the nest-\ning option which will allow bridging the different spatial\nscales involved in a very elegant way and which will be\nused in two projects (VolPlume, VolARC).\nReconstructions of volcanic aerosol properties from\nobservations represent best estimates of the past his-\ntory of volcanic eruptions and aerosol properties. How-\never, they are by design static data sets and therefore not\nadaptable to idealized experiments, experimentation in\na global climate model framework or addressing poten-\ntial effects of future eruptions. To address these issues,\nthe Easy Volcanic Aerosol (EVA) forcing generator has\nbeen developed (Toohey et al., 2016). EVA provides\nstratospheric aerosol optical properties for a given in-\nput list of volcanic eruption dates and locations based on\na parameterized three-box model of stratospheric trans-\nport and simple scaling relationships used to derive mid-\n12 C. von Savigny et al.: The Research Unit VolImpact Meteorol.

EVA is constructed in a way to enable easy\nmodification of different aspects of aerosol properties,\nincluding spatiotemporal structure of the aerosol distri-\nbution or the spectral properties related to the aerosol\nsize distribution. Volcanic forcing compiled with EVA\nis recommended for experiments in the CMIP6 VolMIP\n(Zanchettin et al., 2016) and the PMIP4 past 1000\n(Jungclaus et al., 2017) activities.\nVolImpact projects will focus on the late 20th cen-\ntury and early 21th century. This period includes a large\nvolcanic eruption, i.e., Mt. Pinatubo in 1991, but also\nseveral small to moderate ones (Figure 1). A set of vol-\ncanic eruptions has been selected from this VolImpact\ncore period (1990\u20132016) based on eruption characteris-\ntics and data availability (Figure 5 and Table 2) which\nwill be studied across the different projects, including\nMt. Pinatubo (1991), Sarychev Peak (2009), Eyjafjal-\nlaj\u00f6kull (2010), Nabro (2011) and Holuhraun (2014).\nVolImpact will also address the Raikoke eruption in June\n2019 which happened after the start of the project.\n6 Collaborations with national and\ninternational projects\nThe VolImpact research activities will greatly bene-\nfit from collaborations with a variety of national and\ninternational research programmes, measurement cam-\npaigns as well as satellite missions. Members of the\nscience teams of the OSIRIS/Odin, SAGE III/ISS or\nOMPS/Suomi satellite missions are, for example, in-\nvolved in the VolImpact projects as collaborators or\nMercator fellows. Close cooperation is foreseen be-\ntween the research unit VolImpact and several inter-\nnational initiatives with similar science objectives. The\nVolImpact research objectives are highly relevant for the\nWCRP core project SPARC (Stratosphere-troposphere\nprocesses and their role in climate), which facilitates\ncoordination of international research activities in var-\nious sub-disciplines related to stratospheric processes.\nVolImpact has in particular strong links to the SSiRC\nFigure 5: Selected volcanic eruptions from the VolImpact core\nperiod which will be specifically addressed in process studies in\nthe individual projects. Circles denote explosive eruptions, triangles\neffusive ones. The size of the symbol is indicative of the VEI (the\nVEIs of the eruptions shown vary between 4 and 6). The tropospheric\nIcelandic eruptions will be used in VolPlume and VolCloud for\nprocess-oriented studies. More details about the eruptions including\navailable measurements are found in Table 2.\ninitiative VolRES (Volcano Response) which aims at im-\nproving our understanding of the impacts of large vol-\ncanic eruptions by coordinating a global response plan\nwith the community to be ready for the next large vol-\ncanic eruption. With its central goal, VolImpact is in line\nwith the broader objectives of the science community\nto better understand the role of volcanoes on climate\nand to be prepared for the next eruption and will hence\nserve as a role model for international activities. The im-\npact of aerosols on clouds, precipitation and climate is\none of the most urgent questions in current climate sci-\nence. Studying volcanic eruptions and their atmospheric\nand climate effects is a promising avenue towards im-\nMeteorol. Z. (Contrib. Atm.

This will enhance our capacity to understand\nobserved past climate variability, to quantify potential\nconsequences of the next large volcanic eruption and to\ndesign observing systems, software tools and strategies\nthat will allow us to learn the most from future eruptions.\nThe overall success of the VolImpact research unit\ndoes, however, not depend on the occurrence of major\nvolcanic eruptions during the project period. Indepen-\ndent of the occurrence of a major eruption during the\nproject period, the new remote sensing and modelling\ncapabilities will help improving the scientific under-\nstanding of poorly known processes related to volcanic\neruptions. In addition, the developed tools can also be\napplied to study pyrocumulus events, which occur much\nmore frequently than major volcanic eruptions (e.g.,\nFromm et al., 2005; Siddaway and Petelina, 2011; Pe-\nterson et al., 2017).\nResearch of the described phase 1 (4/2019\u20133/2022)\nof VolImpact will pave the way for a potential 2nd phase.\nPhysical and chemical modules developed in phase 1\nwill be combined into one modelling suite. Experiments\nwith convection-permitting resolution will be performed\non the global scale with an ultra-fine nest around the vol-\ncano. Such simulations could become an early demon-\nstrator for the potential benefits of the approach to use\nextreme computing for understanding natural extreme\nevents. On the observational side a special emphasis in\na 2nd phase of VolImpact will be on the exploitation\nof future data sets relevant for the VolImpact research\ngoals. This includes in particular upcoming satellite mis-\nsions such as ESA\u2019s EarthCARE, comprising different\ninstruments that are highly relevant for several of the\nVolImpact science projects. In addition, ESA\u2019s ALTIUS\nmission (scheduled for launch in 2022) as well as the\nU.S. mission OMPS JPSS 2 (scheduled for launch in\n2021) will continue satellite limb observations and fill\nthe looming \u201climb-gap\u201d, i.e., the potential interruption\nof the vertical profiling capability of the middle atmo-\nsphere using satellite sensors.\nMore information on VolImpact and instructions on\nhow to access datasets created within the VolImpact\nprojects are provided on the VolImpact website (www.\nuni-greifswald.de/volimpact).\nMeteorol.
